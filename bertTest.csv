Amith (kndy),"[26, 27]",i have been getting charged for changing batteries changing links quite excessively as of late and i figured why not do it myselfof course as a beginner i wasnt sure which tools to buy even after reading conflicting reviews so i purchased the 16piece se set the se watch case tool with adapters and this 10 piece setunlike the others which are made in china this one is made in indiai  toolsthe tools in this battery replacement set are two miniscrewdrivers watch case opener horizontal and not the usually twothree tip tool with adapter seiko case remover plastic tweezer nonmagnetic tweezer dust brush knifeii  removing watch case backand this is probably the tool that i actually have had more success in removing casebacks with a hole on the caseback and that is using the watch tool remover that came with this set  it was easy to use and its funny that a few jewelers were unable to open the case with their watch case opener the blue object in picture so i was glad to see that this thing came in handyi used the screwdrivers from this set the most than what i have in my 16piece as it looks more sturdyi liked how it came with the brush because if you are opening older watches youll notice crumbs or dirt that could have gotten inside and so the brush comes in handythe knife looked like i can cut myself easy with it so i preferred to use the knife case opener for older vintage watches to remove the case back  these casebacks have no holes or divots but by putting your knife to an angle near the lugs these type of cases then remove easily with the knifei also look at the seiko opener and plastic and nonmagnetic tweezers as great tool additions to this setiii  pricefor those who want to change batteries its a pretty great deal for under 10iv  overallthere were tools that came in handy and were very useful for several watches that my 16piece set was unable to open  i do recommend this set as an addition to the 16piece set but if you are looking to remove casebacks the blue object on its own is 4 so its worth owning as i found it easier to remove the case for some watches  the brush is also a nifty addition and literally youre getting quite a bit for this cheap setnow knowing what i do know after buy three se products if you are going to be changing batteries on quartz watches and also removing casebacks and links i recommend the 16piece se set  but because this 10piece comes with items with each selling for 399499 each its a worth addition to your 16piece watch fixing set as it has beneficial tools such as the sturdier miniscrewdrivers the brush and most importantly the case removing tools  its also not a bad idea just in case you have problems or you lose a tool you can look to these extra tools as a backup to your preexisting tool setbut if you need to purchase one this one is great for removing casebacks and for changing batteries  its very affordable but once again you may find the se 16piece more suitable for you especially if you want to start removing your own links  and for batteries it may not remove all cases and even the 16bit set may be ineffective for challenging watches so a se watch case tool with several adapters may be what you needbut once again for the price of this 10piece set and how much the items inside it cost quite a bit if sold piecebypiece  its a steal  definitely recommended,4.0,Comes with the basics to open a case back but I recommend this as an addition to the 16-piece set.,1297209600,"02 9, 2011",26,27,1,0.9259259259259259,1

furniture  as far as i can tell all are identical  so i suggest buying the cheapest  in the local hardware store household goop is usually the cheapest  at the time of this writing plumbing goop is the cheapest on amazon  caveat there is a black version of shoe goopshoes and other leatheruse fresh thin goop  apply a thin layer  if you are trying to glue a large surface such as all or most of a sole it is best two apply goop to both surfacesbut as thin as possible  a wooden popsicle stick may be useful to spread the goop in most cases you need to clamp the layers together  there are a wide variety of clamps available for woodworking which may be helpful in specific situations  if you happen to have a solidwooden shoe stretcher it may be helpful in clamping  as with woodworking firm clamping is important but clamping too hard causes problems  in some cases you may be able to get by with clothespins and heavy rubber bands or blue painters tape  in anycase it is essential to let the glue cure for at least three days before using the shoes  i recommend waiting a week  ive used goop to repair leather watch bands and beltsin generalgoop will bond virtually any material including leather plastics glass and metal  the bond is clear very strong waterproof and hard but flexibleother usesexamples are endless  in addition to the examples below ive used it to repair ceramic plant pots and shoes  i also use it to seal rust spots on my dishwasher rack  the goop it also makes a cushioned surface that will prevent scratches to dishes  i use goop to close small holes in window screens  ive used goop to seal holes in airmattresseselectricalgoop is far superior to electrical tape for splicing wires reinsulating catchewed wires waterproofing and vibrationproofing electrical connections  there is a black variety of shoe goop if you want your repair to be less noticeableplumbinggoop is great for sealing small leaks including garden hose connections etc  however you have to turn off the water and the connections must be absolutely dry  moreover it takes several days for goop to dry to reasonable strength  if you turn on the pressure before then you will make a water balloon  its better to wait a week  moreover it may take several applications to get a thick enough layer of goop to hold against normal household pressureso a sink toilet etc may be outofcommission for at least three days waiting for the goop to dryshortcomings1 an opened tube thickens quickly  store open tubes in a small glass jar with a tight metal lid  old thick goop does not work well for some uses such as repairing shoes but is perfect when you need a thick applicationsuch as insulating an exposed electrical connection or to hold pressure in a leaking water line  it is best to start with a thin layer from a new tube to maximally bond to the surface2 until it dries goop flows alot  therefore a thicklyapplied layer may dry to a very thin layer because most of the glue has flowed somewhere else  so it may be essential to apply several thin layers at intervals of 4 hours or longer rather than one thick layer  alternatively you can apply a thicker layer of old thick goop over an initial layer of new goop  if possible arrange the pieces you are gluing to minimize flowing ie usually horizontal  for several hours depending on the temperature etc the glue is repositionable after thickening a little that is you can push it back into place  unfortunately if you use too many layers or reposition the glue too much the result is not as attractive3 except when still tacky when it can be removed with naptha or acetone goop is essentially noncleanupable  so for example while it might be terrific for fixing a leaking windshield if you mess up and your application is ugly there is essentially nothing you can do about it  although goop is terrific for repairing a broken ceramic statuetteif a little extra oozes out there is no way to clean it up the excess  you could simply peelruboff excess silicon glue  you could simply wipe off white glue and clean up with a moist paper towel4 the fumes are strong and toxic  allow glued items to dry in a wellventilated area ideally outofdoor for several days  when doing alot of gluing i work in my carport with a large utility fan blowing the fumes awayand still usually get a nasty headache  it is best to use gloves when working with goopto goop or not to goopwhile goop is truly miraculousthere are situations when other types of glue are better choiceswhite glue  for most lightduty indoor household applications which do not have to be waterproof ordinary household white glue is much safer cleanup is much easier and in most cases repairs are redoable if you make a mistake  for exampleelmers all multipurpose white glue 7 58 oz e379wood glue  carpenterss wood glue is essentially waterproof when dry white household glue  it is much better than goop for most wood repairs  it penetrates and strengthens the wood  it is much safer and cleanup is much easier  if the joint breaks again because the wood is weak it can be reglued  for exampleelmers e701 carpenters wood glue 8ouncesilicon glue  silicon glue is best for glass and when you want a truly flexible connection for example to absorb vibrations  it is a better choice for general household use on glass plastic and metal when you do not need the maximum possible strength  it is safer than goop and cleanup is easier  like goop silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength weeks to reach maximum strength  for examplege silicone ii household glue 28 ozepoxy  when you need a strong rigid workable eg sandable surface adhesive particularly for use on metal or hard plastic epoxy is a muchbetter choice  for joining metal jb weld epoxy is best  most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage and so are good for filling gaps  fiberglass epoxy is best for joiningfilling hard plastic  epoxies are safer than goop and cure much quicker  the major drawback to epoxies is that they consist of two parts resin and hardener which must be mixed in small batches and then applied with your own applicator eg a toothpick  some are packaged in a dualsyringebut that is not an adequate solution because the components must still be manually mixed in order harden to maximum strength  previously a major drawback was that all epoxies were colored usually whitebut now clear epoxies are available  for examplejb weld 8265s cold weldclearbond h3s clear strong epoxy adhesive syringe  85ozsuperglue krazy glue  superglue is very strong rigid and fast  in many ways it is similar to 2minute epoxyexcept that no mixing is required  although very hard superglue is brittle and so is not recommended for flexible objects  superglue is hazardous in that it can easily glue fingers etc together  previously i used superglue frequently on objects eg jewelry when a clear bond was requiredhowever goop is better for such applications and clear epoxies have become available  opened superglue keeps poorly even in tighly sealed glass containersso i recommended packages of multiple very small tubesbazic super glue 3 grams 010 ounces 6 per packkrazy glue

clogs up the tip  if you plan to use the glue again within about a week then jam an old unused uncut applicator tip over the one on the tube and store in a small glass jar with a tight lid  if you arent likely to do more gluing within two weeks remove the tip and put the cap back on and store the tube in a small jar with a tight lid  if it is necessary to clean out an applicator tip then take it off the tube let the glue dry for several days then pull it out with tweezersconclusiongoop is one of those miracle products with a thousands uses which needs to be a permanent part of any

6648,A1RPJHUVVSI98A,B000MARQFA,Justin Opinion,"[4, 4]",like most of you if you are reading reviews for these pants i am always on the hunt for that perfect pair of practical or cargo or tactical as you prefer pants i am not military or law enforcement and i dont really want to look like a wannabee  but i do engage in practical activities that require a good pair of practical pants im a competitive shooter mostly idpa and need pants that can hold and stow a lot of gear for a long day at the range i also need them to be strong and durable comfortable and to allow good freedom of movement and yeah i will also wear them all weekend long too or on trips around townthere are a few key brand names in the tactical pants business 511 is one perhaps the most popular or well known it is difficult to discuss the attributes of a pair of tac pants without making the obvious comparisons to 511 add to that  this pant is designed very similar in many aspects to the 511 tactical pants therefore it is almost necessary to compare them sidebysideif you dont want to read all the way through  heres the cut to the chase i like them very much and have purchased more than one pair now heres why quality of finish and materials is top notch there are no loose threads no crooked seams no dropped stiches good stuff all around ripstop material is light but incredibly strong you will get a lot of wear from these pants before they hit the rag pile they also feel very breathable unlike a typical synthetic feel this could just be because they are lightweight but it works sizing is very accurate one important note however  the sizing is a very true sizing not vanity sizing i have several 511 pants in 32 waist and they are much looser than these propper pants are at the waist that is good and bad its okay if you really do know and order your real size but not if you rely on the extra that most clothing makers give these days that said i would like a wee little bit of relaxation to the waist the expandable elastic waistband is a bit rough on the skin this is in part due to the synthetic material opposed to soft cotton but worn snug they will leave some red marks the propper pants are almost a carbon copy of the 511 design but for a few key and very notable exceptions rear pockets are not as low cut as 511 but run straight across at the back inside the rear pockets which are large and roomy there is a second pocket that is regular sized and perfect for a wallet this is a huge plus for me because i hate my wallet rolling around inside the 511 pants and landing in all sorts of uncomfortable spots the wallet stays put right where it should be in the proppers  whether you are a right or left cheek kinda guy they are both there the front right pocket has a watch pocket as well as a small inner subpocket at the bottom both good to have the left has neither and is just a normal pocket front pockets are well cut with a good angle allowing easy inout access for your hand  even if youre holding something in your hand fewer belt loops on propper than on 511 and differently spaced less material in the crotch area on propper than on 511 if you do significant crouching activities you may notice the difference the fly is shorter on the propper maybe by 12 or more overall this does have an ergonomic impact gentlemen i prefer the 511 one things that are samesimilar to 511 tactical pro the lower edges of the pocket stitching is reinforced for a knife or flashlight clip or similar this should help prevent premature wear from metal clips front pockets only on propper 511 has it also on rears left side small cargo pocket perfect for most cell phones flashlight magazine etc basically identical to 511 right appendix dring on belt loop similar material weight and construction ripstop synthetic blend miscellaneous comparisons in no particular order 511 is overall more comfortable right off the bat but propper is cleaner looking and dressier propper has much less droopy flat butt look than 511 trade is comfort and flex versus ego and appearance your significant other will tell you that you look better in the propper pants  propper includes a nice dutystyle belt in the matching color of your pants thats nothing to sneeze at because even a cheap duty belt is 20 or more the belt is great quality but is a bit longer than it needs to be a great added valueoverall i dont want to give an opinion about one versus the other i think the comparison is important whether youre trying to decide between the two brands for a first purchase or if youre familiar with 511 already in the final analysis  i like these propper tactical lightweight pants and will order more i have the gray  which is much darker than the photo here shows khaki would probably be my next choice since summer is coming soon propper is about 10 less than 511 as of this writing consider the included belt and that is a great value i think you owe it to yourself to give

Charme,"[1, 1]",i have been wearing these for the past five years years ago on a family vacation at a lake with a rocky shoreline i sliced my toe open on a rock after that i tried various water shoes and sandals over the years none of which i really liked then one day at the beach i saw a friend wearing these and he bought me a grey pair for my birthday i have worn nothing else sincei recently bought a second pair in black not because the first pair had worn out they still work just fine but because i wanted a different color and think the black pair look really sharp here is why i like these1 this is the most heavy duty pair of sandals that i have owned while some reviews have noted that they are heavier than other sandals which is true to me that does not affect their comfort in any way or the ability to walk or run in them i like running on the beach with these because i dont have to worry if they get wet2 these provide the best protection for your feet that i know of no worries about stubbing your toe because the toe is reinforced like no other sandal or water shoe that i have owned its like having the protection of a work bootone review notes that sand can collect in the toe area and other parts of the sandal when you walk on the beach true but it is not uncomfortable and i just rinse these off when i leave the beach for the day3 the bottom also provides solid reinforcement no worries for me about cutting my feet on broken shells at the beach or slippery rocks at the lake these have also protected my feet from sharp coral reef and jagged volcanic rocks that i have encountered on vacation these sandals literally saved me from serious personal injury when a jet ski i was riding on vacation flipped over in an area filled with volcanic rocksi felt them on the bottom of these sandals as i tried to right the jet ski without these sandals my feet would have been sliced to ribbons4 the traction on these is excellent i have used these to go into the deep end of an empty in ground pool that is coated with slimy algae to clean the walls without losing my balance i have also used them to climb on jettys at the beach5 i wear a medium width and recommend that you size up either a half size or full size my first pair were a full size up and a little loose my current pair is a half size up and fits perfectly but each persons feet are differentbottom line i wear these for any water related activity that i dosailing power boating jet skiing walking on the beach going in the ocean even swimming in a lake that has a rocky bottom it is a little tough to swim with them but i prefer that to slicing my feet on a rock i highly recommend themshop for price during the summer you can often find them on sale for 1520 off i bought mine online on sale from ems,5.0,Great sandal for all water activities,1340755200,"06 27, 2012",1,1,0,1.0,1

and from work every day  which involves daily repetitive usage of the zippers and pockets i also use it for travelling and weekend trips sometimes with large heavy loads  and can be very tough on a backpack in general in the past i owned a north face recon pack  which at almost 6 years old was dated in design though not falling apartthis pack seems on par with the quality of the north face pack as far as materials go  and at less than half the price the design is perfect for travelling with three separate large compartments as well as lots of cool little stash spots perfect nay ideal for organization on a 3day trip the feel of the pack is solid and very well made the zippers a crucial fail point on cheap packs are thicktoothed and burly the laptop pouch is great and easy to access in line at aiport security via its own special zipper right above the straps it is also well padded including the bottom where it rightly has the thickest padding the carrying handle on top is a dream  padded and comfortable i often carry my pack using that handle so its nice to see it becoming standard on many packs these daysi initially wondered why the water bottle pouches 2 did not have cinch straps at the top like north face does  but in actual usage i actually prefer them like this i tend to use the side pockets for quickaccess storage and these flushmount pouches are superior to the loose floppy north face design they are deep as well so they hold tall bottles way better as well as a bunch of random stuff when i want to quickly dump things somewhere when on the gothe very top small storage pouch is awesome and perfectly designed  when i go to lunch i can dip right in for my wallet and keys without having to dig around or even move the bag at all  brilliant perfect for ready access items the front organizer pouch has a killer little velcro phone pocket in it this is better for storing smallish items like lip balm coins and extra batteries rather than a phone  the rest of the organizer area is pretty meh like most organizers in backpacks things tend to just get thrown into that front pocket i find the side water bottle pouches better to drop a phone into its easier to hear it ring toothe shoulder straps are the best i have ever used on a daypack the high sierra integrated suspension system works i was very doubtful this thing feels like a dream on the back also a really cool feature is that the bottom straps have stopper clips on them to prevent that annoying run through where a strap comes out of the fastener and hangs free how is this the first pack i have ever seen this on these stopper clips also have super handy pullin holes where you can tighten them with one finger another incredibly innovative design that took me by surprisehigh sierra has hit a home run with this pack as far as i am concerned and obviously i am very anal about my backpack performance and specs it literally goes everywhere i go in all conditions with all types of loads i appreciated the very detailed reviews of various packs when i started looking for a new one so i hope others of like mind find this of interestside note several reviewers expressed concern over that extra fabric covering the two main zippers these are rain flaps which help prevent water intrusion through the zipper i guess only backpack idiot savants like me know that yes they can get in the way sometimes but youll be very glad its there during a downpour  they make a big differencei paid 3900 with free prime shipping 2day delivery  blackblack model  and boy does this seem like one hell of a dealupdate i have discovered that the laptop pouch also doubles as an amazing beer cooler i can easily fit 3 bottles more possibly in there along with my gel icepack its essentially as good as any softsided cooler and found it kept my drinks cold and safe all night sweetalso i have to restate this the little stash pouch on top for readyaccess stuff like keys and wallet is perhaps the best single innovation i have ever seen on a pack no more digging around in other pockets for my keys  such at concerts it has proven to be a godsend when i am slightly inebriated not to mention at work when i need to grab my keys and run i dont even need to move my packupdate  ten months laterthe pack still looks brand new it has been to two multiday camping music festivals a week in new orleans on foot several day hikes 7 concerts many weekend trips many beach trips and daily use back and forth to my office where it is often used to courier my amazon purchases home if there is a known punishment that humans can inflict upon a helpless backpack verily  i have delivered it unto this high sierrais the fabric made of a futuristic impenetrable teflonadamantium fibre are the zippers forged from molten eagle talons was the design itself created by a 13yearold boy with aspergers living in the ukraine and enhanced with gamma rays i dont knowbut it is one hell of a pack,5.0,A

johnston and murphy etc the leather sole is stiff and rigid and they are meant to conform to your foot over time so there may or may not be a breakin period however you will have to let them get acquainted with your footthese can be shined which hold superior gloss versus many of the other less expensive brands moreover you buy these shoes to stay with you a long time as they can be recrafted new sole and tightens the leather a bit for a little above 100 which will turn them into a somewhat new pair of allen edmonds shoe that is already somewhat molded with your footquality 910issuesit took me 2 returns 1 from amazon and 1 directly from allen edmonds to force my hand in putting 2 stars for an allen edmond shoe this being said i will still buy their shoes for the hope that this oneflagship and iconical lineis an anomalymy current shoe closet has many pairs of allen edmonds shoes eg strand lasalle neumora with experience in 1st quality and 2nd quality nothing has been less than expected from a superior line when examining the quality of the shoe with the exception of subjective observations the park avenue the staple of allen edmonds shoes has been the pariah where these were supposed to be the foundation1st pairas noted by many people over the internet with the park avenues seemingly being the only violater there is bowing ie topline bulge at the mouth of the shoe explained more the part surrounding your ankle has too much excess of leather ie seemingly not made proportionally so that the sides bulge from excess material the latter allows much creasing on the sides so that it looks like your ankle is achicken ankle think of pants that are too big creasing at the waist when a belt is cinchedmy first pair from amazon had this problem along with unsightly creasing at the mouth from excess leather needless to say it was not a good looking shoe in general i can make compromises with other less expensive pairs of shoes however when i make the conscious choice to purchase quality shoes i expect nothing less than perfection at least enough perfection by eyeing it when you choose to spend more for a luxury car or watch you may be overspending however one thing will not be a question the quality is above average and it will work as intended nothing morefrom the latter problems i returned them based on the bowing2nd pairthe first shoe looked as it should and there was minimal bowing see normal the next shoe right pair had a flopping right side on the mouth topline bulgeagain this was confirmed when i put my foot inside it was so bad i could stick 23 fingers one on top of the other inside the space made by the too big leather it looked very very badit should be noted that i can be so adament about the lack of tightness around the mouth because of my experience with previous allen edmonds shoesand dress shoes in general from various manufacturers the sizing is not the issueknowing amazon does not allow returns after the 1st rightfully so as they at that point figure it is an issue with the product in general i contacted customer service and explained the situation they thus investigated their current stock for the problemmeanwhile i contact allen edmonds directly where i was met with the much documented good customer service where i was told to send them back even though i purchased them from an online retailer with the explanation of the problem3rd pairreceiving them fairly quickly after i sent them everything on the shoe looked goodfinallyuntil i examined a little more in detail as i am not necessarily a finicky or judging person not too harshly where i would forgive scrapes scratches creases before i wear them or smudges the next problem is unacceptable for a the type of shoe manufacturer allen edmonds representscrooked toe capas i said previously that everything on the 3rd pair looked fine top line bulge was non existent and tight there was a new problemthe toe cap where it is supposed to be straight across180 degreesthe shoe it was more like 165 instead of a plane it was a slope the right shoe was more apparent than the left however they would be straight if i walked with my toes outward pretty good if i was trying out a charlie chaplin actthough for normal use pretty toughat this point i am getting slightly impatient with constantly exchanging shoes however the problems are so that i cannot accept a subpar pair from a manufacturer that you pay for having pristine qualitythese have all been 1st quality for the record even the seconds i purchased were obviously better put together than this lucky group of threeeven with the issues i intend to exchange them until i get a pair that is satisfactory if this begins to be the norm rather than the exception and other lines are affected as well then i will start to question what direction allen edmonds as a company is wanting to go942013 addendum4th pairexchanged the 3rd pair the exchange directly from allen edmonds with the toecap crooked problem with amazon and the new pair has none of the above noted problems no bowing and no crooked toe capnot sure what would cause these quality control problems as the pairs that i received would be fairly ok as seconds even though the bowing really adjusts the look of the shoe the cost of replacing this many times and at the risk of allen edmonds customer base changing their opinion somewhat of the companies philosophy and quality would certainly not be worth having to go over a shoe for its proper production4th time should not be a charm in this case not with the price

20652,AX3T5TI76TOJ1,B000T7LEIQ,TurquoiseEyes13579,"[1, 1]",i have been a regular exerciser since 1996 heaven knows i have owned many pairs of workout shoes in that time typically workout shoes last me anywhere from three to six months with a schedule of working out forty to sixtyfive minutes a day six to seven days a week consistently  ive had many good pairs of shoes and many awful ones the best pairs of shoes ive owned either for workout or wearaday have always come from saucony obviously one cannot wear sneakers all the time in life but i wear these when i can get away with it not only are they designed to keep your feet breathing thanks to the mesh upper in most of their designs but they are always fashionable in looks and feel good on from the second that they are taken out of the box  very rarely have i ever experienced the need to break in saucony shoes this is not true for the new balance brand with me as a comparison in workout shoes while initially saucony shoes can cost a bit more money than some other sneakers out there this brand consistently tends to wear out much less quickly than others at least in my case workout shoes almost consistently follow the rule that you get what you pay for especially if you have anything but a completely painfree body no injury history and perfect feetmy stats for you to compare your stats to mine seeing how these shoes might work for you i wear a size 11w and this is my true size in every shoe that i have ever worn since i was a teenager i have averagesized ankles for a fullfigured woman id say about theyre about 10 around  i am plussized so i require some padding in my shoes to keep my feet joints and lower back happy  yet i am big enough that i definitely do not want extra heft in my shoe and it can be tough to find the right shoe meeting those two conditions  i have problems with underpronating supination evidenced by the fact that i always wear the outside tread of my shoes out before any other part of the tread  i have an average instep and my arches are basically normal with a little bit of tendency towards flat feet especially if im stuck wearing lowquality shoes like for a friends weddingmy point is that i know if the shoes are right for me if they give me a spring in my step these definitely achieve that goal before i switched to supinationcorrecting shoes i had really given up on highintensity exercise but i do brisk walking aerobics both floor and step plyometric exercises jumps and highimpact moves but in moderation lighttomoderate strengthtraining lots of floorbased exercises for the abdominalscorespinal erectorgluteshipsthighs some pilates some yoga and lots of athletic stretches  so in other words i need a combination of stability and flexibility in my shoes i need something that will flex when i do lunges but wont make me wobble when i require extra balance such as when im doing highstep aerobics this shoe is amazing in that it allows for both of these requirements to be met and they are lightweight honestly its like barefoot but better i never feel like these shoes are in my way adding weight and too much motion control to get full rangeofmotion in exercises for the daily exerciser they know how important this isthey are also great as daytoday shoes i walk so much faster in them than i do even my other sneakers i spent an eighthour day recently touring nw washington dc mostly on foot pounding the concrete as i toured the city climbing steps to get in on and out of the metro a zillion times  i took the long trip past the navys memorial fountain the national lawn walking up the national gallery steps and around its marble floors towards the end of the day yet i felt great all day and into the night and had no fatigue or pain the next day either i had very severe knee problems at one point and i can tell you that these are fantastic if you have those problems in your historya hint that may help in doing exercise shoeshopping do not automatically buy shoes labeled for flat feet or high arches if you have either of those problems instead look at the tread of a pair of your wellworn shoes if they are shoes related to the activity youre buying a new pair for all the better  my tip is to remember that your arch type is only a part of the equation in shoeshopping  if you wear out the inner tread of shoes then youll likely need motion control to move more safely and will probably need a shoe designed for overpronators but heres the thing to watch out formany times it is the standard recommendation to buy shoes for overpronation automatically if one has flat feet i took that advice for years at face value and doing so slowed down my workouts and was hard on my knees and back i was doing the exact opposite of what i needed as despite being flatfooted to a degree i am actually a supinator the tread on my shoes was the clue although it must be stated that ive regained my arches significantly through losing a lot of weight and by doing exercisesstretches to strengthen and regain normal arches while supination is allegedly more common in people with high arches andor very high insteps dont automatically assume that you need the kind of motion control which shoes for overpronators are often designed for regardless of your type of foot look at the tread everything starts with the feet the wrong shoes lead to ankle knee back and foot problems no one needs more wear and tear on their body once i addressed my true issue supination i finally found the shoes that give me the spring in my step needed i could finally do the highimpact aerobics running in place jumping jacks deeper lunges deeper squats tallbox climbs and plyometric jumps without feeling pain in the knees andor lower back  it was also more comfortable for my feet  if you do the type of workouts that i do you probably need a shoe with a lot of flexibility almost like being barefoot but cannot take the barefoot shoes currently in vogue due to highimpact movements some people do well with the barefoot shoes but my shoe size body type and level of physical activity make wearing those type of shoes lessthanideal so this sneaker is a godsend to me i love to exercise and these make that easier and more enjoyable saucony excels in giving me a flexible supportive strong shoe with good looks and just enough motion control that i never feel like im losing my balance in them it was so important to my body that it actually lessened the fatigue i felt postworkout to invest in these shoes i work harder than ever in my workouts but experience far less achiness from my workouts since wearing these shoes they are truly awesome i hope that anyone who buys these has the same wonderful experience with themto the saucony co please expand your availability of this shoe in the various colors for ladies like me with wide feet  11w is now a very common shoe size i would buy a pair of these in every color if i could but you only make one color available to me in that size and keep your best shoes like these available for purchase  please dont change these they rock,5.0,The absolute best workout shoes that I have EVER had!!!
