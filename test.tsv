121	i bought two of these, and we have used them both multiple times.  they are made well and the clip is heavy duty.  make sure to use it with a strong handle on your suitcase, as the design is such that it pulls significantly on the handle when carrying the second suitcase.  this item is also useful to attach other items, such as on small carryons or your travel pillow.  two of these belts were vital to my international travel alone with a toddler and tons of suitcases/stroller/carryons/car seat, etc.  they helped to strap items together for easy transport, and i was able to get through the airports with everything in tow.  i highly recommend them!update feb 2012:  i have used these straps on multiple trips and they have held up well.  at one point i used the strap on three suitcases at once, including a large rolling duffel bag, a large suitcase, and a medium suitcase.  it kept everything together and i was able to navigate through international airports with multiple suitcases strapped together, car seat, diaper bag, backpack, and toddler (in an ergo baby carrier).  without this strap, i don't know what i would have done!  such a little product, and so important!!!
146	great!!! service, i got excately what i ordered and received it in 4 days!  i recommend'em and will to my friends and family as well..
164	i love this. it was cheap, and it is super cute and the kids just adore it. anything to do with dora is always a hit, and they felt like it was similar to her backpack...
225	hard to beat the price but i didn't expect that casio still made this bad back lighting for night viewing.  i gave the watch away a day after i got it.
259	man let me tell you, i always wanted a pair of these but i was being cheap and didnt want to spend the money...but as you can see i broke down and went for it.  i searched and searched and i am so glad for amazon's buyers writing reviews because this is what made me go for it.  i read most all of the reviews to make my determination of size because i made a mistake before because i didn't know to order a size smaller.  if you a female and are buying a pair of converse you better get a size smaller if the listings say converse men.  i love, love, love these dang shoes and i love the fact that now that i know what size to order.  the fit is perfect.
278	not black!like an awful green blacki love converse, but these black ones are just ugly. i don't even want to wear them for they do not match my other black clothes in the closet.sucks
312	retro shoe, great fit for toddlers with a little extra to room for wide baby feet. look really cute, good price
543	this wallet is absolutely perfect!  it holds everything i need, and keeps it all organized.  as for size, i would call it a medium sized wallet, it wouldn't be good for a small purse.
545	this leather wallet is soft leather, holds cash, cards, and change.  it is easy to close and closes tight.  doesn't take up a lot  of space in your purse.
682	i can understand why this affordable nightgown received positive reviews but it is too thin to wear outside of the bedroom in my opinion.
847	this is the only minimizer bra i have found that supports me well.  i tried another,more expensive brand at one time, but came back to the bali. i discovered with the other bra, my breasts were always sagging and spilling over.  i wear a 34ddd.  if i don't have a good bra my back suffers, not to mention the fit of the clothes.  the bali provides both.
901	very sheer, which is good, but the caf&eacute; au lait  color has more tan to it than i expected.  overall, still a good purchase and i will buy more in other colors in the future.
924	i've been needing a nude shade and this one seemed to fit the bill.  however it is really thin and will probably run immediately.  also i'm not too sure about the color for my skin tone.
939	i think a color labeled &#34;barely there&#34; should be much more neutral. i realize that if i had a dark tan or were of a different ethnicity perhaps these hose would look &#34;barely there&#34; on my legs. but as it is they remind me of the nylons i wore in junior high, colored &#34;cinnamon.&#34; in fact i may send them back, i'm so disappointed. the shades depicted online are not at all representative. cannot speak to fit or durability as i haven't tried them on yet.
956	this bra is pretty, and i do love the &#34;bounce&#34; that a good balconette bra gives, but the straps on this bra stretched out almost immediately, resulting in me constantly pulling up fallen-down straps all day.i wouldn't recommend this bra is you're a large-breasted woman.
1002	what a beautiful color and the fit is great.  i love to have a wide selection of color in my undies and this bra is beautiful.  the quality is excellent and the price was great.  i wear a 34ddd and am glad amazon carries all the things i desire.
1006	there are many kind of bra out there, such as the coobie strappy v-neck lace trim bras; but then there is this item from felina women. this bra has both style and fabrics going for it.  you will disappointed from this item. i assure you.
1079	i ordered these jockey underpants after talking with a friend, who really likes these undies.  i ride horses and have issues with rubs from the saddle with almost any other underpants i have tried.  this brand fixed my rub problem. i like the covered elastic legs and the high leg cut design. what i did not like is the fact that one color (dark gray) shrank two sizes when i first washed it.  the other colors did not shrink (white and heather gray).  the company says shrinkage is about 10%, but my experience is that shrinkage is more, particularly from top to bottom, rather than shrinking around.  jockey has also offered to let me return the pair that shrank excessively.
1098	i have worn these for years, but was concerned about recent reviews reporting an odor.  they do have a smell, like you might have from your detergent.  it is not strong enough to concern me, but i would just as soon it not be there. i have washed them once  before wearing and will see what happens as i do more washings.  the fit is as usual and i like the colors and pattern.
1103	fit. comfortable. prime. who could ask for more? it would only be nicer if more patterns were prime. i had to buy three sets of these to get prime and now i have a lot of blue in my drawer.
1170	i'm a reformed chubster so i'm still packing flab galore. i bought this to wear with a semi-fitted dress and shrug. not exactly revealing, but i felt i needed the protection. looked fine and liked the way this felt. it was not confining or uncomfortable. did a good job and i felt confident.yesterday it was frigid so i decided to use this as an extra layer under my jeggings that are fitted. i wasn't thinking in regard to hiding anything. i just wanted to stay warm. anyway, when i put the jeggings on i thought they seemed baggy or loose. they've always felt fitted. when i met my friend for lunch she asked me if i was still losing weight because my pants were loose fitting. ditto for my husband.spanx work, but darn if i can explain it. they go on easily. while they are fitted to conform to the body they don't feel tight. they are comfortable enough that i forget i'm wearing them.i ordered a medium and since i normally wear an 8 or 10 they are true to size. i have friends who wear plus sizes and tell me the size they wear are consistent with the garment sizes they normally wear.i either hand wash or wash on a gentle cycle using woolite and air dry. just went out and bought two more pairs in tan and black. can't put a price tag on confidence.
1174	after several purchases, i'm beginning to feel that the extra $$$ for spanx is not worth it. i think i'll stick to flexees.
1178	to any wardrobe! the thing about these panties are: you have to size up. if you are not sizing up, they are not going to fit right, or control what you need them to control. i bought one pair - according to the manufacturer's sizing - and quickly found out that they were too small. tried the next size up, and got the rolling effect. tried two sizes up and i was in the zone. they squoze in tight though, so i went three sizes up and found the pair for me. now, i'm not saying that you have to go three sizes up to find the right pair for you, but it is doubtful that the right size will be your normal size. i would start two sizes up to be safe. this seems to be the general consensus from everyone that i know that owns a pair of these.  besides, who wants to feel like a stuffed sausage under your clothes??  final word: buy the right size. once you find it, you will see that these are a must. let's face it, this designer found a niche in the market and now everyone is trying to capatilize on her initiative. most of them do the trick, but how comfortable are you? the feel of these power panties are fabulous, and once you find the perfect size for you, you can be stylish, smooth, and comfortable in your clothes. i don't leave home without mine!
1262	i know these are sold for boys, but i wear a 8 (sometimes 8.5) in women's and these are great.  i bought a size 6.5 and they fit with plenty of room.  they are also extremely comfortable for boots.  i cannot wait to wear these through the michigan winter and see how they hold up!
1344	they are my son's 5th pair. he only wears merrell jungle moc since he was 8 years old. he loves them.
1394	if i could give it zero stars i would.  not only was it huge.  the body would fit my three year old....but the legs would fit my 9 year old.  plus we ordered a superman costume.  this showed up without a cape and was a &#34;super hero&#34; suit.  the belt was made from felt and the the details were painted on with bad paint that peeled off, and were not even straight lines.  bad form amazon for letting this one slip by.
1415	i have weak ankles, and decided that i needed to wear high top sneakers to give me some support. years ago, i wore reeboks exclusively, in many different styles, and never had any problems with sizing. i had read some of the reviews that noted that the shoes ran narrow, but i figured that i would try them anyhow.the shoes arrived yesterday. i liked the sneaker, and the way that they were made. problem was, that after just one look, i knew that they were not for me. they weren't a little narrow, but so narrow that it was obvious, to the naked eye, that these sneakers would not fit. i tried one on, and was just about able to squeeze my foot into them. walk in them, forget it.there way no way that i could wear them. some people had suggested buying a larger size, but i was afraid that it would not work. they still would be narrow, and too long.i have looked all over the internet, for a basic, white hightop, at a reasonable price. apparently anything that i have seen are either very expensive, or come in garish colors only. any suggestions?
1430	i started wearing these thorlo thick cushion hiking socks a few years ago based on reviews and i am delighted. since their sizing is more specific, the socks fit perfectly, not too big like most. there's no extra material bunching in my shoes. these are now the only socks i buy and wear them year round. they are not cheap but they last an amazingly long time. worth the price! (but i did stock up during a sale!)
1439	i couldn't be happier with this sock. it is just so comfortable and the quality is just so high. never say no to this until you actually try it. it worths the full retail price. now i know how socks should be made. i would highly recommend this.
1467	these pants come so close to being perfect! the fit and color were accurate and true to amazon's descriptions. they are stiff at first, almost like wearing a new burlap bag. a few washes later and they're getting much better. if you leave them in the dryer they will dry pretty wrinkled and in the wrinkle's creases it leaves faint white marks. i have no idea what these are, but they are unsightly. they also come with a slight boot cut which makes them fit perfectly until it gets to the knee, they it looks baggy. my biggest complaint is lack of security in the pockets. aren't these suppose to be for rugged carpenters and outdoorsmens? none of the pockets have any buttons or even velcro. i spend a nervous day in downtown new york city constantly feeling my pockets to make sure my wallet and phone hadn't slipped out. other than that, i love them. they are constructed like fort knox. the crotch definitely isn't going to split anytime soon. i can see these lasting for years.
1484	i'm a cabinetmaker with 35 years of experience. i've been wearing this type of carhartt pants for years. they are very comfortable, have plenty of pockets for various tools and pencils, etc. they get excellent wear and run tru to size.
1584	"when dockers discontinued my favorite pocketed t's five years ago, i started my quest for replacements. i've been disappointed until two weeks ago when i came back to carhartt men's workwear pocket t-shirts. for starters, i bought one large and one xl.i'm 6'2"" and 200 pounds. while the xl hides my recently acquired larger waist, it's also so large that it could accommodate shoulder pads. further, the length covers a good part of my pockets in my jeans or shorts. the large is close to a perfect fit, and just a little big in the shoulders.they did not shrink when just thrown into the washer and dryer, and came out remarkably almost wrinkle free.i don't know why it's called ""workwear."" it's very comfortable, a little heavier than the better pocket t's, and will be my daily wear when i hike, am on a photo shoot, ""working"" around the house, or just lazing around. i'd consider it ""casual wear.""i just bought 6 more, all in large.ew"
1663	"i just ordered 5 of these for work and theyre really nice...one note..get the next size smaller!!!!  im a big guy and normally wear a 2x for comfort and freedom,but a xl is the perfect size for me.i bought 1 xl and 1 2xl before deciding what size to get and the 2xl was wayyyy big.the xl is perfect and its long so you wont get that ""plumbers crack"" when working.according to a ton of reviews these wont shrink either so it looks like i have work shirts for a long time...although i wish these were made in u.s.a,theyre made in honduras which is better than china anyday****update 3/23/13**** after owning these shirts for 2 weeks i definately love them,but my advice to get a smaller size was a bit too early..i washed these and dried them in the dryer and they definately shrunk.other reviews claimed they ""would not shrink"",but mine all have..the 2 xl that was wayyy too big before is now the perfect size and the xl still fit,but arent as roomy...i appologise to anyone who bought these based on my review,but theyre still great shirts"
1670	i normally wouldn't pay $15 or more for a pair of socks and i didn't in this case. these were on sale for around $10 a pair, and i bought three pair in gray and they have been well worth it.these socks offer superior cushioning in the areas that most typically take the greatest abuse. they don't slip or shift as you wear them and they prevent chaffing and rubbing. the keep my feet warm and dry as they have superior wicking quality. i go for long walks in the woods near my house and my feet feel good afterward which i can only attribute to my hiking boots and these socks. i even poke around the house in these socks because they are comfortable and provide decent traction on hard wood floorsfor what it's worth, i've been wearing these for quite awhile now and they seem to be wearing better than my other socks. no piling or signs of thinning in spots such as the heels which usually go first. they wash up nicely and while not specifically listed as antimicrobial, these keep my feet dry and fresh smelling.
1713	"3/23/11  we've been having enough snow here in south new jersey these last several years that we are getting out our snow blowers and doing our share of shoveling.  having said that, what we get here is nothing compared to other areas on the usa, but for here, a 1/2"" shuts the schools down.  we've had a number of snows producing several feet and on our 360' driveway thats allot of shoveling.  i got the carhartt men's quilt lined duck bib overall for my fiance and they were fabulous.  while running the snow blower he was comfortable, warm and not soaking wet.  actually, he had to take his jacket off.  he wore them over jeans, but they were warm enough that you really would only need long underwear under them.although, this is not really the place for this review i will say that i also bought him a pair of carhartt men's insulated waterproof breathable gloves asin: b002vwjwyu which he loved and at amazon you will see 18 reviews and almost  stars.you cannot go wrong with carhartt."
1715	i get so many compliments on a daily basis on these and they are still super comfortable even though they may not be as comfortable as the originals.
1828	package arrived on time and shoes came in a rockport shoe box.  i ordered some insoles for these shoes, the ones that came were average and slim.  these are great working shoes and the materials used are put well together.
1844	i bought this shoe(9.5 w, chocolate nu buck) because of glowing tributes on this and other sites. the shoe felt great on trying it on initially. i agree with other reviewers that the supplied thin pu insole is laughably thin, and non supportive, creating a false aura of roominess and comfort which does not stand up to(pun intended) prolonged non-recumbency. it does not have the adiprene insoles that most other rockports do. the unusually thick tongue covers most of the dorsum (top) of the foot....and competes for room...you have to open up the laces wide to accommodate it, or your arch top will start hurting. i tried a comfort insole, but it left little room for my toes. i banished the shoe to the back of my rack. recently(after 3 months), i revisited the shoe, and remembered my previous travails. i trashed the insole first. then i progressively stuffed paper napkins into the toe and ball area, leaving it overnight for a few days, to stretch it. finally i equipped it with a my favorite spenco insolespenco polysorb cross trainer, women's 9-10 / men's 8-9. so, after a few days of foot & heartache, and a few hours daily d&c; (dilatation and curettage), the shoe is very usable and comfortable for my 12-18 hour duties as a physician. in the mean time, i discovered and am using a pair ofclarks men's wave.tract lace upwhich are very comfortable and supportive without any modifications for my purpose of prolonged walking and standing.addendum: some musings after 18 months of occasional use: 1/6/1014,i have worn this shoe about 50-60 times, and they look and feel great. it has a wide flat platform, and is great/stable for standing, but not as good as some other more modern designs for prolonged walking. the nubuck leather (color is more medium tan rather than chocolate as advertised) has maintained its finish, thanks in part to initial treatment withkiwi suede and nubuck protector, 4.25 ozand occasional use ofkiwi suede nubuck cleaneri reach out for these shoes when i want a tan colored shoe that i will wear all day. they fit a little high around the anke, and i tend to use them more in spring and fall, when it is not rainy. with my sporadic use, and some tlc it seems they will last forever.
1882	i am thrilled with the quality of these earrings and so glad that with 14k gold, they are still quite affordable.the stones are excellently matched in color and just the perfect shade of brown that goes with anything.  they stand out on the lobe and i was worried they'd be really small, but they are not.  in spite of the decent size of the stones, these are really lightweight and you can't tell you're wearing them, at all.i think these would make an excellent gift and i'm considering buying an additional pair, just for that purpose!
1892	i bought these during a sale and got them for just under $50. i plan to use them as a birthday gift.  they are just the right size.  i wish i could have them for myself! i expected they would be flimsy, but they don't seem to be at all.  highly recommend especially when on sale.
1918	looks great, but they are not 100% solid gold (too much alley material, it fells too plastic and flexible) too expensive. not recommendable
1964	these earrings are exactly as described and are very good quality at a reasonable price.  the catch is firm (only had them a week - hope that's still true a year from now!), which is important because i've been known to lose hoops.
2002	these gold earrings come in a lovely box adn will make an excellent stocking stuffer for my daughter!  i wish i had ordered another pair for myself!
2003	i bought it when it was in the gold box deal for $19.99. it's a very pretty and shining gold just like the photo really. the gold ball is so hollow and made it very..very thin. the push back lock is a little tiny super small that i had a hard time to hold it in my hands and tried it on my ears not easily. i'm 4'11&#34;, my ring size is between 4 and 5, imagine even my fingers have the hard time to put it together on my ears, that's not good for me. when i received it, the gold ball had the little dent about 3mm, and the push back i could not use it, it fell through right away when tried it on. so i returned it without the problem. and if you are the one who always change your earrings several times a week or a month, i would not recommend to buy this one. but if you are so careful and very delicate on jewelry, it should not be a problem.
2013	beautiful earrings but one of the backs was missing.  this is embarrassing when giving as a gift.  fortunately, i had another from another earring, but when buying fine jewelry, this is not appropriate.
2017	for $10 these were too good to pass up.  first noticed that the gold balls are glued or welded into the stem.. the earring is not all one piece.  first time i wore them, lost one because the back slipped off though they weren't tugged or snagged to cause the earring to pop out.this is the second pair i bought... first set was fine.  seems like the quality of construction may be slipping  (or a different supplier?)
2033	they are perfect. the are a wonderful gold color. they are large enough to go with any outfit and small enough to be ladylike.
2078	the size is perfect and as i like to mix gold and silver they are just right for me. very attractive. would recommend
2088	"these are very nice, substantial, yet light-weight earrings. it's great ""notice me"" size, but not over-done. i wear them frequently.however, the current price is appalling. i purchased them in 2007 for under 50 clams! insanely low-priced then, but insanely high-priced now. no way would i pay the asking price for these, much less the list. urgh! these earring previously listed for just over one hundred, and i got them on a one day deal for just over 40.these are nice earrings, but don't over-pay for these! they should be going in the 100-150 range. wait for a deal when there is additional money off. increased gold prices or not. these are not worth 250. trust me."
2089	i bought these earrings as a lightning deal special last november. i've been very satisfied with them. size-wise, the external diameter of the earring is pretty much identical to that of a us nickel ($.05) coin.  i laid one of the earrings on top of a nickel coin, and when i lined up the bottom of the earring with the edge of the coin, the fastener wire at the top extended just a bit beyond the edge of the coin - at the open end, not the hinge end.i like the feel of these earrings; they aren't too heavy to be comfortable to wear, but they are substantial. they present a nice profile from the front.i've worn them a few times a week for three or four months now, with no problems at all. the fasteners seem to be a little hard to snap shut, but i like that because it means they are not likely to come unfastened accidentally. and they haven't come undone by accident, unlike other hoops with similar closures, which have sometimes been slipped open by contact with a scarf or coat collar.updated on june 30, 2012: these earrings are still one of my go-to wardrobe mainstays. i wear them at least three days a week, and they are usually the only earrings i take when traveling. i have no idea if the quality of the earrings being sold now, is different from this pair that i bought two and a half years ago. however, my earrings (the 14k yellow and white gold version) are still going strong. the wire fasteners are still working well and the finish is clear and bright. i haven't abused these earrings but i haven't babied them, either. the price of precious metals has gone up since late 2009 when i bought these, and my budget's rather tight right now. if not for those two facts i'd be buying the all-yellow-gold version of these earrings in a heartbeat. for now, they are on my wish list.
2110	these are absolutely wonderful leggings!  i have tried many brands and styles of leggings in the past and have never had any as great as these.  they are extremely comfortable, have just the right amount of stretch/support ratio, and can be worn by themselves or as undergarments if it is cold.  they tend to run a little small...so order a size larger than you normally would.a+++ product!
2149	so, yes, i suppose i'm going through my second childhood...but, really, i had good reason to order this watch for kids!  (i'm 68)  first of all i like lizards.  but beside that fetish, i needed a watch that is comfortable to wear, easy to get on, won't overpower my skinny old wrist and that is inexpensive enough so that if i smash the thing doing barn chores, i won't feel any great loss.  this little cutie absolutely rates top notch on all counts.  i can't tell you how many people have complemented my choice...perhaps they're also waiting for me to wear my underwear on the outside of my clothes, too....but hey....if you can't be &#34;different&#34; you're just another old lady who rides horseback. and it keeps perfect time, too!
2153	this is the perfect watch!! i have been searching for a watch for my 4 year old son and this turned out to be the best we've found.  i saw some other timex watches but i guess they were a junior size, this size is perfect for my son's tiny wrist, it adjusts perfect and has a lot of length on the wrist so it can fit when he grows up.  the first thing we did with this watch was to go to the pool, my son wore it during a whole day of swimming and playing at the pool and it worked perfectly, it even has a light that he loves, the little geckos are cute, i would definitely recomend this watch...we really love it, and the price is perfect!!
2232	"while much of the negative commentary concerned levi strauss's move away from domestic manufacturing has focused on the button-fly 501s, the bigger problem i have seen is with the old 1970's standby, the 505, which has a zipper as opposed to button fly. the variability on sizing and sew quality with the 505s is an issue if you are going to buy them online or mail order. you really have to try them on to see how they fit. the 501 are much easier to buy online or by mail order because the sizing is much less critical on the waist, which is the so-called ""anti-fit"" waist, meaning there is no curve to the rise (the distance between the crotch and the top of the waist), because the original 501s were merely cut down bib overalls which were made to hang, rather than be fitted to the waist. the biggest problem i have noted on the 505's is the variability in size in the thigh area, meaning that some fit baggy and some seem rather tight, even though they are theoretically the same size of a label. since the 501s are more forgiving as far as sizing, if you are buying online you might consider them instead of 505s, unless you don't want the button fly."
2299	way too small. have owned a dozen pair of these and they fit perfectly. these are too small, a weird cut, definitely irregular. very disappointing.
2309	it is perfect. it fits me great.
2334	paper thin fabric will not last anywhere near the 501s of yesteryear.  fit is unreliable.  feel is very disappointing.  will not buy again until levis goes back to the old denim material. absolutely disgusted!
2364	we consistently buy levis from amazon. my 16 y/o is 6'1 and we can never ever find any brand of jean in a 34 l except here. he's also slim and most long pants come with a big waist.we can find 30 x34 on amazon esp the levis. he still wears them half down his rear though despite them finally being long enough!
2400	"i am so hard on watches and this watch has made it through it all. i love my skagen and probably will never buy another brand of watch.my particular one is fairly water resistant, i've splashed water in and near it, and even put my hand into the turtle tank once when i had to get the turtle out when the lightbulb got wet, exploding sharp glass all over. i didn't have a moment to take off the watch, so in it went. it came out fine. i do not usually immerse this watch although i don't take it off to wash my hands or scrub dishes before they go into the dishwasher. i wouldn't immerse it often though.in 5 years of ownership, i wore this watch almost every day for the first 4. then i bought 2 more skagen watches to expand my ""wardrobe."" that should tell you something right there. here's my analysis:pros:*many skagens have this mesh bracelet. it is wonderful and i can't say enough about it. hypoallergenic, breathable like no other band. i'm allergic to everything, my skin is so acidic it will literally eat the chrome finish off of things. not so with this watch, since it's surgical stainless steel.*in 4 years, i have had to replace the battery once. great battery life.*attractive, gets comments.*flashy flat glass gets attention and if you can't read, just tilt to angle and it works great.*love the sparkly little crystals.*matching brushed silver face.*easily adjustable band. takes a small screwdriver to pry up the clamping clasp. easy.*good locking safety clasp. if the catch gets loose, just give it a little pressure from pliers and it becomes tight again.*super low profile. sits close to your wrist which helps out on the first ""con""cons:*all skagens have low-quality glass. it does chip, scratch, etc. i'm very hard on watches so it's definitely taken some abuse. it still looks good though-- that was the only thing that made it lose a star. i wish skagen had a more expensive line with real sapphire crystals, i'd be willing to pay more. they are worth it.*no second-hand."
2429	it's ok for the price, but i found the cups to be a bit big. otherwise, it is nice and long so you don't get a weird line where it ends.
2440	"although i initially thought it was too big, i ended up moving my socks out of it to fit my makeup in.it's substantially made and hangs well but the velcro closure is about 10"" away from where it should be if you have the bag reasonably packed.  i had to add a new velcro piece to make the bag stay closed."
2621	i don't know if these are warm, they were so flimsy that i knew i would destroy them after wearing only a few times.  i returned them.
2624	really liked the look and feel, but the fit was completely improper. ordered a 13, but fit like an 11.
2630	i love these shoes. i should have gotten a half size smaller but they are comfortable and look great. i tried to get these smaller in other colors but they were sold out. i am a vegetarian and only wear vegan and it is awesome how many great vegan options are available on amazon. it used to be so hard and way too expensive to find vegan shoes. i will buy more.
2631	it is difficult to find a good, vegan walking shoe so i jumped on these when i saw them.  i didn't have high hopes.  i am very rough on shoes (brisk two mile walk with the dogs every day) and normally need a lot of padding and support (torn meniscus).  when these arrived i didn't expect there to be enough of either.  wrong.  i can't say that i wear them every day but at least 4 times a week for walks and a few other times each week for general running around.  after ten months, these look like new and are still very comfortable.  my original pair is gray with orange (very cute) and i just ordered the navy.update:  the blue and white shoes are nothing like my original pair!!  if you look closely at the pictures you will see the difference.  instead of shoe laces, they have sewn in elastic.  and rather than sturdy construction, they are flimsy with no reinforced padding at the heel.  they would not be at all comfortable.  it appears that the beige/brown choice is the same.  these should not be sold along side the others.  wish i could do a separate one star review on the blue.  these are going back.
2644	this is the second carhartt coat i've purchased over the years and have not been sorry either time.  fits well and very warm. carhartt customer for life.
2652	very thin and small on a large wrist . super easy to read even with the date and time window looking like a hand in the dark.it lights up well with a push on the wind stem . the watch face numbered ring it self is about the size of 2  quarter coins stacked . i think they measured to the widest edges at the band pins . great value and function for the price , i would recommend it to a thin wristed man or anyone knowing its small .
2752	i got two different watches for my twin granddaughters:  this one and the red balloon kids' w000182 butterflies stainless steel time teacher watch.this one was their favorite because they could get it off and on easily, it fit their small wrists well, and they loved that it glowed in the dark.
2809	i'm a welder and have put these to the test. they have held up better than every other pair of jeans i've ever owned.
3051	my hubby looks great in them. they are a well made brand. you get the money worth with the dickies brand.
3089	can't ever go wrong with buster browns.can only use on one foot as the other isin wraps from surgery, but perfect for  onefoot or two.
3154	this is a very comfortable bra but i ordered it in my regular size and found it a bit too large.  the end of the seams poked out too much and would not be good under a t-shirt. the bra is very soft but does not define, in other words, it ends up a uniboob type.  this would be good for sleeping but not wearing in public.  does not lift enough.  it is *definitely* a leisure bra.
3179	this bra is very comfortable. i hate a regular bra. i would recommend this bra to anyone that is tired of fighting the straps from a regular bra.
3188	i ordered the same bra size i normally wear, and the band is very tight. the shoulder straps (which are not adjustable) were also tight. i've lost some weight since purchasing the bra, and it's still tight but wearable. previously, i couldn't bear to wear it at all. i'm hoping the elastic will loosen up a bit with time.i can easily see why this bra doesn't work for all ladies. i'm petite and fine-boned, and the shoulder straps are just barely big enough for me (and that's taking into account the weight i lost!). the fabric is wonderfully soft and stretchy, but if you can't find the right size it simply will not work for you. there isn't a lot of leeway because nothing is adjustable.in conclusion, i suggest selecting at least one band size up from normal, and making sure to order from a vendor with a good return policy.
3219	"i originally bought one of these bras in a department store when they didn't have any nursing bras my size, and i purchased an additional one from amazon later.  the salesperson said she wore this bra all the time while her baby was breastfeeding!  the salesperson helped me find the correct size so that the underwires do not pinch my breast tissue, which can lead to clogged ducts.  i actually only pump since my baby never learned to breastfeed, but it's very easy to unsnap the front to pump.  the stretchy cups accomodate size changes throughout the day from breastfeeding, and the underwires make it so much more flattering than the wire free bras i've tried.  my only complaint is that the cups are very thin, so i need to wear nursing pads to prevent ""headlights"" -- for this reason, i will not wear these bras once i'm done breastfeeding and will go back to a padded or molded cup style."
3231	the girlfriend here. i was excited to try this bra but it just wasn't for me. i did end up returning it. it was accurately sized and felt very comfortable but it seemed to push down and not lift and i prefer a little lift! otherwise it would be a very comfortable bra. i don't care for the extra thin cups either, i like a very slight thickness, not padded but not nylon thin either. these cups are nylon thin.
3254	these are very nice underpanties if you have a straight shape, but if you are a little thick around the middle, they will roll down.  for that reason, i returned them.
3288	my new panties are so soft and comfortable.  i have tried at least 3 different no line panties all of which have lines somewhere.  what is that about.  but my jockey's are great.  lots of give so no binding when you twist or stretch, look sleek beneath pants, you have to check you remembered to put them on.  thanks,
3310	the reason for the purchase of this bra was because it was described as a minimizer bra. not! on it's own it is a normal cheaper bra, but a minimizer it is not! the best minimizers out their are wacoal, they are more costly but well worth it.
3328	having gained some weight, my bali woman's lace bra got put into storage.  weight gone now and brought out older bras.  rhere it was. oh happy day, i had forgotten about this comfortable and beautiful bra. i instantly went to amazon and there it was, waiting. i bought two and will be back next payday to get two more. being a dd size, it's difficult to find a comfortable bra. love, love, love this my bali bra
3339	i bought this bra over two years ago on a whim from a different website, and i almost wore it out to the point where the hooks on the back started coming apart. its lacy so i wasn't expecting much comfort, but i literally wore it day and night plus my girls arent as &#34;perky&#34; as they were after my first baby so they give excellent support, are true to size, and comfortable enough. they also dont show through any cute shirt you might want to wear.
3352	fits well and feels comfortable but i wish it had just a little more lining so my nipples didn't show with some tops.can't wear it with everthing.
3379	i have been wearing vf's for a long time. i find of what is out threr you can't beat the quality of their products,
3434	this bra is the most comfortable bra i have ever worn.. it gives good support and it doesn't pinch or bind like some do.. this is the one bra i buy the most.. i have tried others but they just weren't as nice as this one.
3442	was ok for the cost, but did not support well in cups. and was not cotton where it needed to be for comfort sake [inside under band]
3501	"i am 5'5"" and about 160 lbs. i got the size queen 1 because of the reviews saying to get a size up since they cut into your thigh. i am wearing these with a garter belt under a dress so i needed them to fit comfortably. i got nude, and i am very pale and the color works. they aren't too shiny either. this size is supposed to fit up to 225 lbs and 5'6"" and they fit pretty well on my thigh but the lace band sits pretty low. it starts just a few inches above my knee, so keep that in mind. you will need adjustable garter straps and a knee length dress. i can't wait to try these on with my garter and dress!"
3526	these thigh highs dont have that tight ugly roll at the top - they're smooth up top and stay up on their own well.
3557	nice hose, but to small and will not stay up.the largest size are still to small for big thigh womenthey don't make these hose large enough
3741	i've always wanted to buy several levi's and be brand loyal but over the years the sizing across several styles and denim is simply all over the place. seat is usually way too tight or too baggy (as is the fit),  inseam is always way too long. had hopes with this style but again, disappointed. certainly not a brand for those looking to avoid way too skinny or way too baggy jeans. simple straight legged pants that fit as sized on the labeling are extremely hard to come by these days. levi's sizing is so erratic you basically need to try on a dozen pairs across a dozen styles to get remotely close to what might adequately fit. shouldn't be this hard to buy levi's.
3754	these levi jeans are excellent.  they are exactly as advertised.  quality is top notch.  they are well fitting and comfortable.  very happy with this purchase.
3798	the customer service with this seller was fantastic but the bra itself has little to be desired. yes it's comfy but that straps loosen and fall, i have to keep readjusting myself and i have verified it's the correct size. i won't return it just won't order another one.
3803	this is one underwired bra that i would purchase for as long as it is on the market.  i would prefer more options for buying, i.e. vendors, color and sales.  it is comfortable, adjustable and retains it's shape longer than others i have purchased.  the only drawback is that the underwire pokes through the fabric after several months.
3841	as another reviewer mentioned, it's hard to find an xs girdle/shaper and this one certainly does the job of taking away a couple inches off my waist to look great in wedding dress. however all of the cinching is at the waist and perhaps not enough in the hip area which gives you an almost unnatural silhouette: tiny waist, big hips, flattened top of butt - my torso and hips feel a bit like 2 sausage links separated at the waist but on the good side it gives you a very 50s  bombshell figure under the right type of clothes. i don't recommend wearing it under fitted or slinky clothing, for me that looks a little bizarre and you can clearly see the hooks. but it is perfect under layered clothing, much like a wedding dress!
3847	"this cincher is as firm as they get and chisels out a fantastic waist. if you're looking for a great silhouette under fitted clothes that aren't too clingy, this is your secret weapon. it's my go-to shapewear when wearing jeans and a button-front sweater, or with dresses that nip in at the waist (the garters are very sturdy) but don't cling to the body. button-front sweaters hide the hooks in front of the cincher--which will otherwise show through clothes--and if you're a bit ""fluffy"" in back this might not be the best choice for you under fabrics that closely show the shape of your back (it might blend with the line of your bra... it might not). overall it's a solid and well-used part of my shapewear wardrobe. note: rago has a line of products that are not always identified clearly in amazon; check out [...] for details."
3862	"i had such high hopes for this garment. it's pretty, well constructed, relatively lightweight, came in higher sizes, and had decent firming and control for a time, but this garment is soooooo uncomfortable! i found the material scratchy and hard, it also didn't really ""give"" or conform to my body. while the upper half did do a decent job of holding me in, the lower half was an  epic failure!  the legs kept rolling up, and that made the whole thing constantly twist, uggh! needless to say i spent the day adjusting, and by the end of the day i was peeling myself out of this shaper in pain with red marks from all the twisting and adjusting. i made my purchase based on the reviews i'd read, i bought it in black, white, & beige. i wish people were more forthcoming and analytical in their reviews, it would have saved me a great deal of time and disappointment.  maybe it's me but i returned the 2 i didn't wear and my search continues. so sad..."
3905	wacoal used to be my brand of choice. then their bra sizing changed. now a usually loose, casual fit pantie size is too tight around & too long up & down. the lace used to be smooth, too & now it's rough & scratchy. not a good thing for lingerie.going back!
3925	great bra, great fit  - i wear the beige one all the time under t-shirts and and blouses that are slightly sheer. very comfortable, one of my go-to bras. if you are wearing something very clingy, the top cup edges will show through (but i don't wear those...) recommend!
3981	i hate skinny jeans!  i wear boot-cut jeans exclusively; probably because i usually wear boots!  love the cut and fit of levis bootcut...skinny and tight above the knee, but masculine and flared out at the bottom to accommodate boots.  don't get me wrong, i will wear regular sneakers and flipflops too, all look good with these jeans.
4031	60% cotton and 40% polyester t shirt. now, it was described as 100% cotton, and that's what i wanted to buy. if the sellers are not able to honestly describe their product, then they will lose the ability to sell to people via the web. its imperitive that the sellers are honest, for us to buy sight unseen.  people don't realize, perhaps, that polyester cotton blended cloth is much cheaper than pure cotton. pure cotton breathes in hot weather, and absorbs sweat better.  the shirt looks ok, the color and size is nice, so is the cut.  but, it will wear out much faster, than 100% cotton. it wont fade in that cool way that 100% cotton does, nor will it shrink a bit, which is why i buy 2x for 100% cotton. i'm very disappointed, especially because my time was wasted, simply because the seller felt like being dishonest.
4042	i don't like this waist cincher. i bought a size small, i'm 5'9&#34;, 145lbs. even at my height, the back of the cincher was too long in the back. and because i have a curvy behind, it immediately flipped up at my behind.  it is impossible for this thing to lie smooth if you have junk in the trunk. so in addition to waistline bulges, now i have a fold of power mesh on the top of my rump. it didn't do a good job of pulling me in.  i think it's no better than flexees. it gives the waistline a very odd shape. i regret buying it. i will still stick with squeem.
4114	bought at my significant other's request, and i turned out to like it more than him. not only are they cute and a flattering cut, but the lace is a charming pattern and the feel is comfortable against your skin. too often those skimpy string-thongs start to chafe, but wearing this pair throughout the day you end up forgetting it's there. great for under tight dresses or other clothes that show panty-lines.
4233	i'm looking for a sports bra that gives me really good separation of my breasts. i hate my boobs touching each other when i'm exercising, or really any time. i'm anti-uniboob! i have some nice regular bras that do the job, but no sports bras. i wish someone would find one that doesn't cost a fortune and let me know. i'm usually a 34 c. i tried that and it was *way* too small in the cups, really smooshed me together. now i have a 34 d. it's a better fit, and it mostly separates. i don't know if going up to a 34 dd would give me the fit i want or not.
4287	"i loved my keen sandals, mostly due to nice fit, they were a little sweatty though.  so much that i bought the shoes (very good), bought the work boots (steel toed also very good), bought the socks (not so good).i don't honestly wear the h2 sandals that much, maybe had them about a year (bought them last late summer/fall), but live in the northeast so its mostly a summer shoe, 4 -5 months a year or so.  so we went to grand tetons, these were my ""off hiking day"" shoes for the trip.  we did a 6 mile flat hike and the backs ripped out of one of them. by the way the socks have holes in the sides (not heals or toes like you might expect).  used to be all their products seemed to have 5 star ratings... me thinks the expansion to all kinds of shoes may be causing some kind of performance issues.so not much use, the treads on the bottom frankly look brand new but the heels ripped.  i dunno if i will get another keen shoe, i am seeing some of their newer stuff has some bad ratings.  still i'd take them over almost anything teva, but not at full price. i guess i would take another shot for $50 or $60... but for $100 they need to last more than a season."
4312	the sandal ordered felt very tight on the sides of the foot. i usually order 1/2 size bigger shoes and these were no exception. the length was just right, but there was pressure on the side, at the widest point of the foot. and i do not have a wide foot, any other shoes i have purchased (sandals, sneakers, dress shoes) had fit ok. otherwise the sandal appeared very well made. i'm giving it 3 stars just because of the fit, quality is very good. i'm returning these and will see if if the same come in wide sizes.
4333	i like these sandals very much. good looking, sturdy, comfortable. though they are a little tight near the top of my foot, my feet do get sweaty, and a little pricey.
4334	i have been wearing these for the past five years. years ago on a family vacation at a lake with a rocky shoreline, i sliced my toe open on a rock. after that i tried various water shoes and sandals over the years, none of which i really liked. then one day at the beach i saw a friend wearing these, and he bought me a grey pair for my birthday. i have worn nothing else since.i recently bought a second pair in black, not because the first pair had worn out (they still work just fine), but because i wanted a different color, and think the black pair look really sharp. here is why i like these.1. this is the most heavy duty pair of sandals that i have owned. while some reviews have noted that they are heavier than other sandals (which is true), to me that does not affect their comfort in any way, or the ability to walk or run in them (i like running on the beach with these because i don't have to worry if they get wet).2. these provide the best protection for your feet that i know of. no worries about stubbing your toe because the toe is reinforced like no other sandal or water shoe that i have owned. it's like having the protection of a work boot.one review notes that sand can collect in the toe area and other parts of the sandal when you walk on the beach. true, but it is not uncomfortable, and i just rinse these off when i leave the beach for the day.3. the bottom also provides solid reinforcement. no worries for me about cutting my feet on broken shells at the beach or slippery rocks at the lake. these have also protected my feet from sharp coral reef and jagged volcanic rocks that i have encountered on vacation. these sandals literally saved me from serious personal injury when a jet ski i was riding on vacation flipped over in an area filled with volcanic rocks--i felt them on the bottom of these sandals as i tried to right the jet ski. without these sandals my feet would have been sliced to ribbons.4. the traction on these is excellent. i have used these to go into the deep end of an empty in ground pool that is coated with slimy algae to clean the walls without losing my balance. i have also used them to climb on jettys at the beach.5. i wear a medium width and recommend that you size up either a half size or full size. my first pair were a full size up and a little loose. my current pair is a half size up and fits perfectly. but each person's feet are different.bottom line: i wear these for any water related activity that i do--sailing, power boating, jet skiing, walking on the beach, going in the ocean, even swimming in a lake that has a rocky bottom (it is a little tough to swim with them, but i prefer that to slicing my feet on a rock). i highly recommend them.shop for price. during the summer you can often find them on sale for 15-20% off. i bought mine online on sale from ems.
4408	"i'm 6'4"" and 300lbs, ordered a xxxl and it fits just the way i like it. sliped over the t-shirt/sweater i was wearing with room to breathe.  quality of stitching and workmanship overall is quite good.  has a permanently attached hood that would do well to go over a baseball cap to keep it off your eyes. stuffs backwards into the zippered front pocket fairly easily.  not lined, so don't expect it to keep you warm but it will contribute to warmth by acting as a wind barrier via layering effect.  it will be a while before i have the chance to try the rainproofness. very happy with the purchase."
4427	the product did fit a hair bit bigger than exspected but thats my fault for ordering a pair of shoes a half a size bigger than i normally wear.  even so i love these shoes they are very comfortable. i bought them for use in the gym. best pair of shoes for lifting in my opinion. opposed to all these toe shoe people that have to or should wash them after every use. stylin with my fuctional green kicks while i watch the bar bow from the massive weight i just ripped off the floor. (well massive weight for me). on a side note if you require walking any distance over irregular shaped gravel, covered in moon dust i suggest walking to the gym in your normal shoes. feel every pebble from being spoiled from wearing shoes all the time.
4469	my guy normally wears an xl, but this was huge on him. too long and too wide. i would say order at least a size smaller than normal.
4655	i got this for my son who is 6'2 and weighs about 250.  the coat fit great, he says it is very comfortable and warm.  he loves the fleece lining.  the price was very good too, i was pleased that he liked it (for once) and that i did not spend an arm and leg on a jacket ~ and it shipped quickly.  i would buy again from vendor.
4711	always wear a 30 inch inseam. when i tried these on they were very long. perhaps they were mislabeled. the waist seemed a little snug as well.
4739	"i ordered the ""brown"" color (not the ""carhartt brown"" or ""dark brown"") and i wasn't sure what i'd receive because the color swatch for brown on the product page looks more like a moss green.  the brown i received can be described as a rust color, a shade of orange-brown.  it's nice, just wanted to share the info on what the color actually looks like.  the pants are the sturdiest i've ever owned, my wife was laughing because it kept its body shape when i took it off and placed it on the ground."
4769	"i ordered two of these carhartt long sleeve shirts, one in ""ash"" color, the other ""navy"" blue. i've had some trouble finding real cotton long sleeve t-shirts (i mean not cotton/algodon which is thin and rough feeling) the reason i bought them at amazon was i've returned so many bought at jcp and macy and thought i read the description to trust amazon. ok, the shirts arrived and right away i notice the ash shirt has that rough feel. each is made in another country, the ash is marked 99% cotton and made in dominican republic; the blue one is 100% cotton made in honduras. the ash shirt shrunk in the first wash so much the sleeves are too short to wear it unless i push up the sleeve. the blue shirt is fine quality shirt all around. so i'm saying be careful...we just don't know nowdays what we will get for our money."
4925	buy as many pairs of these as you can afford.  i bought one pair at a bass pro shop in la and i was hooked. yes they are expensive but they don't: bind, cut in, chafe from sweat, and can last several days without their unwashed nature being noticed.as an experiment i washed them in the shower wrung them out and wore them wet under my pants in the south. it was 90 degrees outside and they stayed cool for about two hours then dried. which was very nice. my girlfriend thought i was nuts and told me so regularly.so i bought 4 more pairs. one boxer, one brief, and two boxer briefs. the 80$ took some consideration and courage but they are that good.a side consideration: i bought them in all colors but white. don't buy white underwear you plan on wearing for days and washing in the sink. ha ha.
5031	next to some anti-microbial, moisture wicking, flame retardant underwear i wore while deployed, this stuff is the best thing going.  spending an entire day working outside in the summer az sun can be brutal, but these boxers did a better job of keeping the moisture away than any cotton boxers would have.  there were times while traveling that i also tested the &#34;wash and wear&#34; theory, washing them at the end of the day and hanging them to dry for the next day.  worked very well.  using a towel to gently wring out excess moisture, these dried overnight and worked great the next day.  the few times i ended up having to wear the same pair for multiple days, they still did a great job of keeping me dry without smelling too foul.  after many positive experiences with my first pair, i ended up buying four pair total.i also wear these daily to work as well as out working on the property.  having retired from the military, i now work in an office that requires business casual.  the flat seams and smooth fit make them extremely comfortable under slacks.all in all, it is really hard find a better pair of moisture wicking underwear.  i can highly recommend these if you don't need a flame retardant capability.
5063	wearing these briefs makes me begin to wonder if women are on to something with all their expensive underwear. then i remind myself that most of their expensive underwear is designed around sex appeal, not comfort.it's great to be a guy. doubly so if you're sporting these boxer briefs.
5094	great underwear.  my husband says they don't ride up.  bought several packs of these.  good deal, fast shipping and happy with purchase
5206	i bought these for my boyfriend as a gift, not even knowing whether he would want them. he's been wearing them ever since!he says they are the most comfortable pants hes ever owned. he is 6'2, 34&#34; waist and 34&#34; inseam, and says they fit length and waist better than any pants he's owned, as well as being soft outside and great color. i would say that they wear a little baggy, but i guess they are still very comfortable to wear.the dark grey that i purchased has a bit of sheen, so i'd call it more of a gunpowder color. also the slick texture seems to resist cat hair pretty well (we have 2 cats so this is a big deal in our house).
5248	gv jeans are great, if you can find the right size.  this is the same old song sung by so many people here, and it's been sung a long time, and gv jeans company just keeps on experimenting with cheaper and cheaper manufacturers, most of whom don't have a clue about hiring employees who can run machines or teaching those who don't.  quality control is non existent.  these jeans, this year, the light denim, were manufactured somewhere in southeast africa and they were laughably small, the completely wrong size, not even a child's size 12 - just wrong.  i don't think consumers ought to have to check the &#34;made in&#34; tag or even be concerned about where an item is made, the company that makes them ought to be involved enough to be proactive in the quest for quality products, but gv hasn't and i don't expect they ever will be. since their jeans are still very popular.  women get disgusted with sizing and quality, then they find a pair that fits, and they love the brand again.  and they continue to buy.  that's what gv counts on.  so... that's the way it goes with this brand.  as for these jeans in particular, as i said, they didn't even try to hit any measurements, or to check for quality, so they went back to amazon, who thankfully has a good return policy.  i haven't bought any more gv jeans since this experience, i just don't love the jeans enough to put up with the never-ending hassle.
5333	i bought this for my husband and he thought it was gorgeous!  it is super shiny, made sturdy and stunning!
5370	"the silver on these is not a woven celtic silver knot. the silver is die cut, thin, almost foil thin. the silver is poorly worked to make it look as though it is a knot, but there are many rough spots. the welding of the know to the stone setting is uneven.  and caution, because it doesn't jump out at you from the product description, the stones are synthetic.the metal is stamped 925 (for sterling, but the workmanship is so bad i question whether this stamp is accurate). the ear wires are also stamped 925.product is labeled ""made in thailand."""
5402	don't wear this out unless you want to get the attention of every man and the ire of any woman in the area. it's supportive and sexy...my man loves it...and the attention it brings.
5458	"this strap fits a small wrist like mine very well without having a long ""tail"" hanging off the buckle. unlike most other plastic straps i've seen, it's also nearly smooth inside, without a lot of creases, knobs and so forth that can be irritating. some brief work with an xacto knife made it fit my 18mm casio watch perfectly. very pleased so far."
5471	i am an active person, be it working on the farm, riding off road, hiking up mountains. i have lost watches in the past with these activities, so need a strap that holds well, to secure the watches that i have a large collection of. every watch i buy gets one of these straps to keep it secure.
5475	"although i have had dickies in the past, the quality of the sewing around the zipper was bad.  after only wearing these to work for the second time, i noticed the stitching was coming apart where the zipper cover was.  it looked as if my zipper was open at the top.  the pants were not small, as a matter of fact i thought a 36"" waist would have been more appropriate after i tried on the 38"", but decided to keep the 38 in case of shrinkage.  anyway, i ended up stitching the seam myself, and now all is well, the comfort and easy care of the work pants are fine."
5515	"good fit, although i took others suggestions about the length and they were dead on. if you typically wear a 32 in the length get a 30"" and you'll be good. i found the waist to be true to size. the pants are comfortable, maybe a touch lightweight for the winter but i get cold easier than most. otherwise very comfortable, they have pleanty of room in legs and the rise is roomy. all in all they look nice and i love the cargo pockets. i would reccomend these to anyone"
5545	well made pants that look nice.  they don't exactly fit loose.  i bought my husband's normal size for jeans, and they fit a bit tight.
5649	i love the delicacy of the gold, very feminine, however it is rigid and hard to adjust .  i have a very small ear i wear it on and every time i wear it, it always falls off because i can't crimp the metal so it will stay in place.  would hate to lose it.
5666	"as it is, this bag is a good value.  the canvas fabric is acceptably sturdy but it could be heavier; it should stand up to a few years of heavy use, but we'll see.  the main compartment is large enough to take a full bag of groceries or a few large (11x14"") sketch books.  the strap cinches up easily so the bag doesn't get in your way when you're riding a bicycle.  one very good design feature: the side bottle pockets, which are exactly-sized to take 32oz nalgene bottles.  they also handle travel mugs well.  another good feature is the two loops on the outside of the flap, which are ideal for mounting bike lights on.downsides are the pathetic interior zippered pocket, which is destined to be chewed to ribbons by pens and any small metal items you put in it.  similarly, the front pockets don't have snaps or velcro, rendering them unsuitable for loose items.given the popularity of this type of bag, the manufacturer should consider a revised or ""deluxe"" version, with a zippered main compartment; a thicker, possibly removable strap, heavier fabric, a better interior pocket, closeable front pockets, and maybe small pockets on the outside of the bottle compartments."
5724	i love this color and the fit is perfect for my 1x figure.  also i have washed and dried it a few times and it wears well.
5815	only time will tell how long they last. but i've had shirts from expensive mail order houses that wore through the elbow in less than a year, and from cheap no-names that lasted ten years. these look nice both with jeans and with a sport jacket.* * *follow-up less than two months later: after only a few wearings and washings, two of these have started to come apart at the seams. this shirt is way too light and flimsy. i would not buy these again. dropped my rating from four stars to two. hopefully my two remaining shirts will last longer.i will stick to the hanes, which seem to be better quality.
5827	i purchased a few of these in several colors to keep my warm at work. i am usually cold, but not anymore. the colors are sharp, they are a good fit (i'm a 38 short and got the large) and i actually like them so much i got the same colors in the short sleeve style for the summer. i also feel it's a good price, since the short sleeve shirts cost the same.as for the fit - i purchased a medium and a large. i usually wear a medium, but both shrank so much i decided to go with the large. the large shrank down to a loose medium, but the medium was a little too tight for me. i have put on some weight since my last purchased, so i think i am a large now. but i wanted everyone to know that they do shrink - big time. plus, with the heavier material it's hard to get them over the shoulder as the material doesn't flex as much.
5841	unless you like thick, bulky, overweight low-quality cotton t-shirts i wouldn't recommend this, it runs too large in my opinion as well.
5914	purchased them for a realtive in order to prevent slipping on non textured floors (varnished hard wood). glad to find on online store.
5919	i was recently in the hospital for a while and dug the socks they gave me. they were pretty comfortable, and definitely kept me from slipping (i was told that i had to wear them so the hospital would avoid a lawsuit). my parents have gotten at the age where i am concerned about their fragility, so i saw these and thought they would be a nice way to avoid any injuries.... and kind of gave them as a gag gift.well, it's a good thing that they come in a giant bundle, because these things fall apart pretty much immediately. walking around the house causes the pads to come off the sock. the hospital socks have a different material on the bottom to create the grip padding --- what these give you is more or less a sticker on a sock.i do not recommend these for anyone that things they're getting anything functional.
5974	first of all, you must be sure that you're wanting a push-up bra when you order this guy.  it's super nice, but the straps are a bit thin on it and i'm thinking that unlike other playtex products, it won't last as long as the rest of them do.  that said, you might want to go up a little in size.  the cups were a bit small, like victoria's secret's items.  quality is much higher than victoria's, but well, the sizing is almost the same.  i'm having to send mine back to get another size, which is larger than what i normally wear in playtex's items.  so love these bras!  they wash and wear nicely too, just keeping my sewing machine close by just in case on this one. highly recommend!
5980	i purchased this bra because i needed a plunge push-up for a wedding i was in and the original bra i had purchased online would not arrive on time.  this bra was the only bra i could find that fit my criteria of a 44d, black, plunge, push-up, that would arrive in time for the wedding.the fit was not great.  my everyday bras are 44d and they fit perfectly.  this bra was too small around.  i could get it closed but the fat under my arms was pushed out very predominantly and this was not going to work.  since i was in a time crunch i just went to a local store and purchased a bra extender to solve that problem (this store doesn't carry my size and is why i didn't purchase a bra here).  after that, no more bulge.  the cup size was fine, but this bra was definitely not the most comfortable.  the straps were constantly slipping off my shoulders.  i had to cinch them so tight just to get them to stay up, that you could see the indent on my shoulders through my dress.  this bra just lacked the overall comfort i'm used to.the push-up aspect wasn't bad.  this was my first push-up bra.  i didn't need a ton of cleavage i just needed some extra lift because my dress was very low cut.  so it worked fine for what i needed.also, at first the straps kept coming out of the clasps holding them on.  they don't close and just slip on and off.  eventually i was able to get this to stop, thankfully.if i hadn't already worn this bra i would return it.  in a pinch i would purchase this again, but if given more time, i would look for a more comfortable bra.
6024	i have neuropathy and my doctor suggested i buy these.  she didn't tell me they were not support stockings however.  i  gave them to a friend who said she likes them a lot.
6041	not being a &#34;shoe person,&#34; this classic slip on design appeals to me.  these fit fine; are well made and comfortable. that is all i want.
6054	this shoe was way too small!  i'm not exaggerating - order it about 3 sizes larger than what you normally wear!  i ended up giving them to the goodwill.  it wasn't worth the hassle of trying to return them.
6099	first off these things are soft as hell on the inside and it feels great wearing them. downside, i am 6 foot tall 190 lbs with a 31 inch waist. i ordered the 32x32 and the problem is that i had to cut off the adjustment hardware all together just to make them fit. they were riding a little high on the boys if you know what i mean. with the adjustment things removed they work just fine for me. i would say order a 34x34 or 34x32 but then they are going to be a bit long and it might not add any extra strap length. so tall lean muscular guys or gals? be repaired to do some minor modifications. i bought these as a joke, since i am from alabama and everyone out west thinks this is what everyone back home wears. now i am in love though and i wear them often.
6146	yeay, shoes that look great and don't torture your feet. i bought these in black patent and was so surprised at how comfortable they were. i wore them the other night and had to walk a few blocks to our dinner reservation and it was no sweat- i am ordering in another color.
6183	i've used these to walk across the brooklyn bridge during a snowstorm, and i felt like i slipped more wearing them.  i'm not sure if it's because i used them on snow instead of ice?  they also kept popping off my boot, so i was afraid i'd lose them.  the wire bits aren't sharp, which makes these safe to put on, but lousy grips!
6205	i enjoyed wearing these slip-ons during the summer. they run true to size and are comfy and well-made. however, i can't wear them for long walks, as they offer no arch support. just a nice, pretty shoe for going shopping or going out to eat. i recommend them.
6222	these are not expensive pants. accordingly, while the value is pretty good, don't expect the finest grade of cotton, or an extraordinary fit. many of the negative reviews of these slacks are unfair because it seems they expected high-grade spun egyptian cotton and custom tailoring, if that's what you want, go buy it (and expect to pay accordingly).that said, these are nice medium weight khakis that are perfect for movie night or a saturday  outing. the sizing is good. if you're like me, and appreciate a sharp crease, know that these are difficult to iron crisply. ( god save us from 'perma-press!' keep that treatment, manufacturer, and let us iron our own!)all your pants shouldn't have to be office-wear quality and cut. these are a good second level pair of trousers, and i recommend them as such.
6255	i like the shirts, no tags, nice and soft... the only reason why i gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that they shrunk length-wise. so now they look very wide and not as long. my daughter is tall and skinny, so the last thing i wanted was for the shirts to get shorter, but it still works. she wears 5t and the size s works for her right now.
6279	my husband wears a large in any brand i've shopped at all major stores, however he was swimming in this shirt.  it is light, cool, and is made very well so i gave it 4 stars.  just beware to buy one size down for a good fit.  the shirt is so nice that we have decided to give it as a gift to family member who is a larger man for christmas.
6294	this is not ocean blue, it looks like dark turquoise or perhaps aquamarine,  there is too much green in it to be ocean blue.  it is not what is pictured.  on the other hand, i've never had a spf 30 shirt before, so maybe there's something to that.  it fits and looks great.  i'll keep this one but remember not to buy from them again.
6310	product came reasonably quick.  comfortable, good looking, slightly large for the size ordered but not going to send it back for that.  i wear these at school.
6349	i am a woman and my size is a petite medium.  the men's small is perfect for me and i will order more.  the sweatshirt is warm and soft.  if you can find the right size for you this is a very good buy.
6360	nice, thick sweatshirt.  you won't be cold in this one!  highly recommended for autumn outdoors work.  i never got cold, even in 40's temps.
6373	i got the sweat shirt and i like my sweatshirts to be really large and roomy as i sometimes wear them over other shirts.  i ordered and extra large thinking these would run closer to men's sizes --but i wish i had ordered and extra extra large.  the sweatshirt fits and it is comfortable enough, but i was looking for a more roomy oversized fit and i didn't really get that by ordering the extra large.  so i believe the sizing is not what some might be expecting since it's a man in the picture wearing the sweatshirt.  but the sweatshirt is labeled unisex.  just beware of the size you are ordering.
6399	this product is sized just right, washes well, and best of all is not too heavy so it is ideal for layering.  the quality of the product is good.  i loved it so much i ordered several in different colors.  the quality and workmanship was consistent with all items.
6463	i work in a kitchen, and these are great on the hard floor. it only took one shift to break them in. true to size.
6509	i am 5'9&#34; and weigh 145 pounds and this size fit me fine. they were just as expected when they arrived.
6510	my 13 year old daughter was delighted with these tights - usually she can't wait to get her ballet tights off as soon as her class ends but these were so comfortable i think she forgot she had them on....
6569	got them as a gift.the most warmest boots i ve ever owned..real comfortable very stylish.good fit i will recommend them to friends
6585	this boot is very comfortable & sturdy, not to mention waaaaay more affordable than uggs. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because their sizing run very small. but other than that, they are super!
6599	these boots fit me perfect. i ordered my true size * and they are nice and snug. thinking about ordering another pair.
6635	they get the job done, and help me conceal my legs on those days i forget to shave. they are comfortable and haven't gotten any runs in them yet in 4 months
6639	i used these not for dance, but for a powepuff girls cosplay. they worked great, were super comfy, perfectly opaque, and all that jazz.i wore them all day, doing rough and ridiculous things, and they did not run or anything like that. they are a great deal!
6642	"i read the reviews and saw tons about the seam inside being uncomfortable in the back.  i had bought a pair of these about 3 years back and there was no such problem then and they were sooo soft, so decided to try anyway.  unfortunately it's true.  the way they've stitched the ending of the seam together center inside back on the top, it's too thick and sticks out about 1/8"" inch, and it's not soft.  if they wouldn't have pulled the waist band so tight to stitch, it wouldn't be a problem, but alas it is.  however, because these tights are soooo soft and durable, my daughter wanted to keep them anyway, and i found a simple fix... a bandaid.  just stick it over that seam that sticks out and voila, no more issues so she can wear the tights for all the perks, without the problem....  i'm sure it could be fixed further maybe by cutting that extra area off and having it stitched together, with less excess, but sewing is unfortunately not my forte.  in comparison though, the regular bloch tights we used to buy, seem to have gotten cheaper in quality though because they used to last years, and now they've ripped within 3 uses....  so just one of those things that makes it hard to decide which way to go.  best of luck!"
6743	wear these with my slacks.  comfy.  fit well. do not lose shape after many washings.  last a long time.  i love gold toe socks.
6831	i should have read the description a little better. these are the knee-high version of these. i was sort of expecting the ones that come half-way up the calf. i like them fine. they are super durable and feel great.
6895	"these socks can be worn comfortably during all seasons except summer. they tend to keep the feet and ankles warm -- a good thing during the cooler months. they do tend to squeeze the ankles and lower legs a bit too tightly. this can prove irritating to anyone with even mild circulation concerns. good cushioning and wicking, but should not be worn all day in athletic shoes as they tend to ""heat up."""
6958	these are just an ok sock - did not really fit that well - plus they shrunk in the wash.buy something else.
6967	considering that these are over-the-calf socks, they fall down within 1/4 mile of walking, which kind of defeats the purpose.
6980	"i'd be careful to read more recent product reviews, as my guess is the quality control on the product has changed dramatically.  the fabric is much thinner and more elastic than i expected - i guess to get a really thick crew sock, you'll have to buy one of their ""fluffies"".  at around $2 per pair i'm not returning these - just disappointed they are not as thick as they were years ago."
7080	glad to get new socks to replace the old ones. fit good and comfortable and a good price for these socks.
7362	birkenstock shoes are the best fit for my feet, and are durable. good shoes-good price-fast service. i reccomend this site.
7375	great shirt, looks good, fits right and washed well. all around good quality. i would recommend this shirt to anyone.
7382	i should know better by now, but this time i figured if i bought the 3x size it might be long enough to at least make it to my belt.  nope.  now, having said that, i'm not a scarecrow by any means--i typically wear xl or xxl t-shirts.  right now i'm wearing a reebok 2x ny giants t-shirt that's about 4 inches longer than this 3x russell t-shirt and i've found this to be true of every russell shirt i've ever purchased. i don't know what they use as a template, but all i can figure is that they use dwarves. check out the model in the picture.  the shirt is hanging below his crotch--when i wear it i look like comic book guy from the simpsons. i wear 40 x 30 jeans, so it's not like i'm fat albert--i'd just like russell to add a couple of inches to all their athletic shirts. their sweatshirts have the same problem.
7405	this shirt has a nice fit & color.  it is very soft & washed well.  generous cut.  my husband seems to like it and has already worn it several times.
7409	"either my shirt was mislabeled, or someone doesn't know how large to make ""large"" size shirt.  it was so big, i just gave it to my grown son, who is much, much bigger than me."
7547	these earrings are just as beautiful as they look in the picture - in fact, better than they look in the picture.  the stones are nicely colored, and are very clear and sparkly.  i don't have a problem with the earrings drooping in my ears.they came packed in good-looking satiny blue individual gift boxes inside a matching larger box.  each small box has a square of anti-tarnish paper in it, which is a nice touch.  i am delighted with them - they look like expensive jewelry, but are quite reasonably priced.  i am extremely satisfied with this purchase!for people who are afraid these earring will fall forward - it is possible to buy very inexpensive acrylic disc earring stabilizer guards.  the stabilizer discs keep heavy earrings flat to the ear.  earring stabilizer discs are available at craft stores.people with small fragile earlobes might also want to take a look at the 3mm gemstone earring set instead:10k gold 3mm garnet, amethyst, blue topaz, peridot and citrine stud earring set
7601	i love these shoes and have bought several colors.  here's why:  the pros's: great if you are on your feet all day- particularly wonderful for rns and hairdressers.  like walking on two rubber balls- but extremely lightweight!  the sole is not a steep arch, almost more like a platform because its thick on the front half too.  also, these are rubber, so they're washable/wipeable/disinfectable!  i also like the extra height it gives me, saves from having to hem alot of pants!  the con's: slightly slippery in water (wish they had deeper tread).  also- the slot holes in front means that things you might spill on your feet could go through.  the biggest possible con however is this: if you are not used to a high platform height, these may be a bit risky for you.  due to their bouncy sole plus their height & design, they seem like they might be a twisted ankle risk for some people- but if you wear platforms and clogs and such already, you'll probably love them like i do and have no problems with this style of shoe. remember- they are high in height!  all in all, i love these shoes!!
7602	but not worth what i paid after i purchased these i found um for only 20 with free shipping...all i had to do was wait a few more day and they were on sale at 6pm.com
7663	pros:-absorbs sweat-dries *kinda* fastcons:-gets ruined easily; backpack straps, anything velcro, they will tear at the material and ruin it really quickly.-though it absorbs sweat, that sweat shows-doesn't look good. definitely not a shirt you can wear out. (imho)definitely wouldn't buy a shirt with this material again.
7677	this is the first time i have ever owned a pair and i like them.i really don't have anything to offer as far as a review of thesecompared to others on the market. the look good. the onlyreason i gave it 4 stars is because of the leather on the back.i'm not a huge fan of leather with name brands printed on thembut that is the compromise i made to have this style of suspenders.
7719	it is difficult to get standard suspender buttons through the button holes in the very stiff leather.  it was necessary to treat the leather to make it somewhat more supple.
7722	i really liked or i can say love my product which was a ring from this company it was very beautiful and pretty. the service here was incredible and what i really liked about it was how well they parcel the product. they were awesome and i have them 100 percent for there service.
7729	i've ordered from gem ave before (2x) the band is not 3mm and looks cheapyou get what you pay for. the package was ripped and the box was what looks like pulled apartthe plastic bag the boxed ring came in looked like it had punch though. on top if i'm wanting to returnit i have to pay shipping which was cost of half the puchase not worth it i'll give it to my niece very disappiontedgem ave
7783	ck are great, and this model is so comfty, be aware of the size, im regular 32 and with ck im 30
7868	i bought this for my husband last year, for christmas. at this point in time, no complaints at all from him. washes well and wears well, and its light color doesn't show white dog hair, which was a must for a new vest!
7881	if you don't care about the fit, buy it. it's cheap and warm. if you care about quality and the fit, you might want to look for a higher priced columbia fleece. i've tried this on and the fit was just awful. the large on this jacket is way too big....it's like a xxl...i own two other columbia jackets (more expensive) and the fit is great. this jacket just seems like columbia made a mistake in the sizes...it seems as if there should be a m and a half...there is a major difference in size between a m and a l...
7972	i would prefer a lobster claw clasp on this chain.  the chain is very nice!  i like the 20 inch length that i purchased.
7996	i bought these for my son. he usually rides his bike while we run. as the runs got longer, he complained more about his sitting bones hurting. he didn't like them at first use, because he said they &#34;felt funny&#34;. he certainly changed his tune later when he wasn't as sore. good quality.
8006	"at a 36g i didnt think that it would ever be possible for me to take a zumba class or run on the treadmill without knocking myself out.  lol!  thank you god for this sports bra!  my ""girls"" stay in place throughout a full workout.  i loved this so much that i bought 2 more! :)  ****warning: the band size runs small! make sure you order one band size up from your actual size.  i had to order a 38g.****"
8081	color is nice. fit our needs. but - both straps broke after minimal use. the backpack is now useless. returning for refund.
8178	all of these reviews are based on nostalgia, this was a great watch in the 80s but now is trash,i don't even think seiko care about this anymore since young people don't used watches as they use to. if you want a mechanical buy an orient diver, is a lot better than this seiko diver. the past is gone, this is not what it used to be, be real.
8197	overall i'm very satisfied with this purchase. only drawback - the alarm can be a lil complicated.
8208	i purchased this watch as a christmas gift for my husband.  he loves watches and i try to add one to his collection each year.this watch is a beauty!  so far (two days after christmas) it has kept perfect time and he's already had one person confuse his watch with a rolex.it is a heavier watch, so if you're looking for ultra light, this isn't the watch for you.all in all...a great find!
8323	i purchased this watch for husband.  he loves the watch!!! as far as i know, there is nothing he dislikes about the watch. he did have to have several watch band links removed because he has a small wrist, but it is normal for him to do so and we expect that anyway.hubby did have to read the manual to figure out how to set the day/date, but it wasn't too difficult.this was my first invicta watch purchase and was great!! because of this watch, i have now added many invicta watches in my wish list for hubby down the road.
8408	this very warm legging. if you are looking for something to keep you warm while your working outside for several hours i will recommend this product.
8460	like many other buyers; i got duped. the scarf i received was purple, wrong color emblem, and 100% acrylic instead of wool. the brand name of the scarf i received was cinereplica, some french company. the scarf listed is &#34;elope&#34; brand. i have seen the correct scarf at a book store, so i know it's out there.
8529	love these panties.  the fit is true to size and they're cool looking; not the boring usual solid black, white or beige.  will definitely look for more to buy.  recommend.
8555	they do not stretch as they are supposed to.....no likey..if you buy these buy them bugger than your usual size
8572	love it very comfortable.  arrived as expected  no panty lines.  easy to care for just drop in washer dries quickly.
8578	i love the fact that these briefs go up to the waist, fit one's bottom, and don't ride up..as well as being made of cotton.
8580	the fit is true to size and i've been looking all over for some quality, neutral tone, all-cotton panties.  they are so comfortable.  the solid fawn is a great color for wearing under light colored summer shorts and slacks - no obvious panties showing through in childish patterns.  i highly recommend these - they wash well also - no noticeable shrinkage.
8630	i love these.  i like the string bikini style to start with, and the double-string is an attractive variation.  the fabric is comfortable against my skin, and i like the way i look wearing them.  they fit true-to-size, and they come in larger sizes, which is quite nice.  thanks, vanity fair!
8636	this is the best bikini panty hands down, fits great, stays put, no ride up, plenty of colors to choose from, and just an all around wonderful panty to wear...
8706	i confess. i never read directions on the package on how to use the watch. so its pretty simple to set up. secondly, looks great on my wrist.  i just wish it had a pedometer on it.  if you're looking at something with a timer, a light and an alarm, you have it. what else does casio make other than a reasonably priced watch and does what it needs to do? hopefully i'll have it around for quite a while why i run around trying to get my excercise done or do yard work. this particular watch is my go-to for the gym, yard and just running around. would i use it for anything else? no
8712	didn't expect the pink colored numbers, unexpected look to it which makes it even cooler, the backlight makes it even funkier and it comes with a 10 year guarantee too. love it, from now on it will be my daily use watch.
8716	it is a great watch. unfortunately  i bougth two and i received just onewhere is the other?. just the boxi paid 43.9 usd for thi watch .
8721	just buy it. you won't regret. as far as color's concerned, black is great. it's not as boring as it looks in stock pictures, and complements beach/summer very well, not to mention it's more versatile. perfect size, even on my thinner wrist. quality all over the watch. you will like it a lot! it took a year for me to actually get this watch (wasted a lotta time reading on forums, etc.) and now i regret that i should've bought this watch in the very beginning. hope this review helps you make decision.
8730	indeed, this is one of the best seiko divers out there for the money, and is a must have if you are a diver and/or collector. this watch means busines and it's available in black and orange. the watch is heavy, 180-grams, and has a seiko's in-house movement, the reliable and robust 7s26, a 21-jewel. the luminous on this watch is best among watches, except battery ones. the bracelet has an extension for those who wear scuba diving suits, and a clasp for security. this watch is easy to put and take off thanx the push button clasp. is the nicest i've seen on any watch in this price class. overall, i'm absolutely delighted to have the seiko skx781k as part of my collection. it's a really fun watch to own. for the money, i think this is probably one of the best watches you can buy if you actually intend to dive with it. even if the watch never sees anything deeper than kitchen sink, it is an excellent watch, but probably won't appeal to everyone, and certainly isn't an every day watch. the quality on detail is superb. heck, when i first saw it, i thought it was ugly as a heavy rock. but the watch really grows on you - once the black and/or orange monster has you in its clutches, it doesn't let go. mtng
8737	"this is my first seiko watch. i've read and heard that every watch collector should have this or it's orange brother in their watch box, so i thought i should try it out. i was so excited to get this i even paid the $3.99 for overnight shipping. when it finally arrived i opened the box and it didn't quite give me that wow factor.  this one is no ""monster"" i don't know why it got that nickname. perhaps the nickname was given back in the day when a watch at 42mm is a monster, i don't know.the case is bit too shiny for my liking. i would have preferred a brushed case. but other than those two things this watch is quite nice looking and very comfortable. for the price you cannot go wrong. the lume on the indices and hands are excellent and the unidirection bezel turns very smoothly and quietly. it's too early for me to tell the accuracy but since it's a seiko so it should be fine. you really can't go wrong with a watch like this. if you are looking for a weekend warrior or daily wearer type watch give this one a try. also if you are looking at those invicta pro divers i would highly recommend that you pay the extra $$$ and get this one instead. it looks very nice and it should last for a very long time..."
8768	this brand runs small. i'm a 38d. i ordered 40d and it's still a bit snug. other than that it's a very comfortable bra. i've even slept in it a few times. several washings and it holds the shape just fine. i'd order this brand again.
8794	i really love this bra but it does run small so make sure and order one or two sizes up.  wonderful back support and ease of front closure make this a must have for full figured women.  i will most certainly being buying this again in the future.
8796	i didn't have very good luck with this product.  it didn't fit properly and wasn't comfortable, so i returned it.
8800	i wasn't sure how to purchase a slip and read that you should go with your bra size. well, that did not work for me with this purchase. the slip is too small and enough so that i can not wear it. a sizing guide would be very helpful.
8806	over all it's great, and i would probably buy it again. it's still a bit see-through, and pretty long. i definitely have to shorten it and take it in to make it a better fit.
8823	the perfect slip for when i am barelegged in the summer; it puts a layer of fabric between the legs.
8869	this is a pretty and comfortable lounger.  i really like the breakaway zipper and the pockets!  it is a bit warmer than i had hoped, but i still love it!
8884	my friend saw this jewelry box and had to send pictures to others that needed a jewelry box. great price!
8951	i am not really into special underwear but having been raised on fruit of the loom and hanes 3-packs with the fly, these are very different and comfortable.  they also last much longer.  i feel they are worth the price, prefer black, and the contour pouch really does make a difference.
8953	i gave this 3 stars. the reason is the supposed pouch is hardly noticable. about big enough for a child maybe but not a man. other than the small pouch they are well made with very good cotton. not see through thin cotton like some underwear and should last a long time.
8997	the jeans were perfect! the same as if you would buy it in the store! levi's, known for their quality jeans, really showed it again this time. they are comfy, and just as they are showed in the picture. if you shop at levi's stores or for levi's elsewhere, i recommend you find the color you want at the store, match it up to one on here and save yourself some money!
9050	"go check out my other dockers pants reviews -> they all pretty much say the same thing: ""leave the pleats far behind and definitely stick with the flat front"".  the d1's are much nicer too being more narrow for slim builds and a younger look.  they are much more flattering and fit way nicer - you'll get by far more compliments!!  we bought a ton of these and any exchanges were taken care of immediately at no charge to us!!beware of the color matching & sometimes they are sized correctly...i've had to make exchanges because of this.  overall, we are very happy!! :) :)"
9220	just love it, it would have been more perfect, if it was a little larger, but it worked just fine for the occasion and matched nicely with my other accessories for the wedding.
9227	this is my favorite style and brand.  they fit well and practically invisible panty line.  expensive but worth it to me.
9334	very pleased with these, they are very comfortable to wear, and have rubber soles so can wear them outdoors, are very good option for wearing around the house. are wellmade, much better than i expected for the price, will be ordering more of these, very handy to have around. i love how can throw them in the washer to clean, too.
9365	bought these as a gift, she says they are comfortable and make her butt look great.  and shes right, about the last part.
9369	these are so comfortable, 95% cotton. i love it that the waist can be rolled down, they can be worn however you want. i ordered a size bigger than i normally wear due to the snug fit. if you wear size large, purchase size xl. the xl is not baggy at all, they fit perfectly.yes they are too long but you can always cut them off. i would definitely order more. i hope this review helps.
9374	i am 113lbs, height about 5'4, these pants are about 32 to 33 inseam, they look perfect with sneakers at the gym or with flip flips when i am out doing errands.  the material is very very thin, somewhat thinner than some of the leggings, you have to wear thong, or embrace your panty lines.
9460	this meets my expectations, the only thing i would change is a light to read the clock at night when i am backpacking. the red light is great for walking through the campground.
9494	i previously bought one of these shirts and love it. my second shirt fits as well as the first. the fit guide, in my case, is very accurate. this is the perfect shirt for the fall as the temperatures drop. good rugged construction with nice pearl style snaps. i would hghly recommend this shirt.
9510	i recently bought 5 new pairs of socks, all of them different styles and brands.  for the past few years i've been wearing thorlos thick cushion running socks which to date are the best socks i've ever worn.  however, they are pricey.  only a few dollars more than what i paid for these socks, but when buying 10 pairs at a time, a few dollars per pair can make a big difference.i would say that these socks are superior to your average hanes and fruit of the loom socks, but not ton much better.  they breathe, feel quite nice against the skin, and seem very durable.  but i don't think they're worth $10 per pair.  maybe $5 per pair, $6 maximum.  they lack the cushioning that i desire and are a tad bit too big.overall, i think you're paying for the name on the sock than the sock itself.  if you find them on sale, i recommend these socks, otherwise, i suggest you fork over a few more dollars and go with thorlos.
9511	they are not large enough, and fairly inflexible. inelastic, cheap, and unwearable for me. i discarded them. i wouldn't recommend buying them
9513	i live in one of the hottest places in the world: mohave valley az, and we go around in shorts for a good part of the year. these are the best quarter length socks i have ever worn; good for work or play. the quarter length cover up my bony ankles and keep out debris when working in tennis shoes, which is normal. i have not been able to destroy a pair yet, while yanking them on (i am usually very successful at this). for full length socks, i recommend gold toe, although when old, they do not pass the yank test.
9562	i bought these on a chance they would be the right color, the right length, comfortable at the waist and look good as he walks in front of me; if you know what i mean. the chance turned out great; he loved the cut of these jeans and was very pleased.  they are the heavier material famously known as jeans; not some updated jean material.  if he is happy, i'm happy.
9652	i bought a few pairs of the blue denim stonewashed men's cowboy cut slim fit jeans so i thought i'd try a couple of pairs in black. i am glad i did! they look great and fit perfectly. very satisifed. i'm tall and slim and they fit great.
9656	have worn wranglers for decades but this is the first time that i purchased them online. i returned them because the seams were out of alignment and that results in the jeans legs being twisted ... and as a result, looking bad.
9717	most guys wear boxer briefs these days and i do too, but i think these things are just so comfortable for certain times.  hoping the pouch loosens up, i need some more room there so as not to be constricted, but overall it's a great product.
9727	i had skin graft chemical burn surgery they compress well. ships on time and looks just like you see on screen
9728	i purchase these for my husband and when i opened the packaged, i had an instant visualization of my husband wearing these. i immediately decided they were going back and ordered him a thicker non see through pair, which he loves.
9734	i got this a few months ago and was trying to live with it. i have to buy another one i got so sick of this ugly shape and hard nylon material. the opening on the legs cuts in to your legs almost stopping blood flow! there is no way to adjust this, it's not elastic either but something hard and set and feels extremely uncomfortable. generally, it's badly cut, badly designed, ugly and shapeless on the body, it sits on your like some kind of plastic bag you pulled over your privates. avoid this like a plague.
9744	this is a great bathing suit for training.  i swim on a regular basis for exercise and this suit allows me to have a snug fit but not be a brief style suit.  i am in my sixties and i perfer to cover more than to show more.  i ordered the suit in my pants size and it fits just right.  not too tight and not too loose.  i plan to buy another one so i can alternate them.
9749	i wear these for lap swimming and end up replacing them about once a year, which is a reasonable lifetime as far as i am concerned, given how often i swim (i'm in the pool three times a week).i like them enough that i've bought the same pair the last 3 times i've had to replace my suit.
9817	i have to admit i love watches. i have some very expensive ones and i have 3 citizen watches to just wear anywhere. citizen watches work very well. better than some ten thousand dollar ones. i am not sure if many people realize this. there are also many brands that sell watches in this price range. with exception to seiko, they do not even come close to the quality of a citizen.
9850	the sizing is accurate, the fabric is lightweight but not so much that you can see through it or expect it to fall apart soon.  the arm holes and neck are the perfect proportions.  very happy with this shirt.
9996	when i got these shirts they fit great! after one washing in cold water and air - drying it turned into a different shirt. they got a lot shorter, up to my belt short and the neck got a lot bigger, showing lots of skin in the front and back. yet some how they stayed wide. they are great if you want a disposable shirt.
10134	"some of the inside seams at the armpits had kind of a ""rats nest"" of the thread used to sew the garment together.  the sewing has held up ok over several washings, but maybe they should ease off on the workers a bit and let them finish their work better.  overall, the t-shirt is comfortable and made with good material."
10206	as the headline said. seems to be good quality. i'll buy more, surely.one two three four five six seven.
10265	i got two of these shirts with a company logo about 6 years ago and wore it only in the house - knockabout.  it's still in great condition.  i bought 5 of the white and 5 of the black and couldn't be happier.  they wash well, last a long time and are soft - so you can wear them all day - and to sleep in.  absolutely fantastic product.
10369	the hat and scarf come as advertised.  the scarf is a nice length and fits well.  this is a great purchase for harry potter fans and is very reasonable priced compared to most harry potter branded apparel.
10403	i was looking for something to wear on my off days as all the other clothes i have are t-shirts and work-related. these fit great, look great and seems as if they will last a long time. i can't really complain too much as the price makes it work.
10524	the jeans are well made and they fit just the way i had expected them to. the denim is of a very good quality. great color and design
10663	i'm a small and have ordered cherokee pants in a small before and they fit snug. i ordered an extra small this time and these were huge on me. dotn know if they changed the measurements for the extra small or what but if ur ordering these i recomend get it 4 sizes smaller than what you are
10686	i am tall for a girl at 5'10 and it is hard to find scrub pants that are long enough for me.  cherokee is the only brand i have found that has a tall pair of scrubs that are actually long!!!  i love the fit.  they do run large.  i wear a size 10 in women's and i am a small in these pants. they are comfy and don't really shrink much with repeated washings and drying.
10699	i wear xs scrub pants but these were so huge. i was not happy with the fit and felt right off. very disappointed.
10820	as most already know, i dress in mens business professional attire for work almost every day.  i tried bostonian once before and had a less than great experience with durability (one heel actually came off for no apparent reason but that was years ago)  i inspected these shoes carefully upon arrival and found to my pleasure that the shoes seem to be very nice and have a high quality look and feel to them.  best of all, when i slipped them on they were fairly comfy right off the bat.  i ordered an 11 d even though i size at 10.5 d.  wear a nice high quality dress sock and you should be fine....wear the cheapo no padding version and you may be a bit loose if you order half sizes above your exact fit.  the proof will be in the pudding of course, but so far, so good!
10871	mine came with the eyelets off left to right, also i also went down a half size ang got at least two sizes larger, the med width was more like lg.it said clarks original quality, then i look and it says made in veitnam for the price of these shoes i expected alot more. also even it's getting harder to find made in u.s.a is my preference, i wasn't expecting it, but veitnam i mean really i'm sending these back and don't want them back i will never buy another pair of clarks shoes no matter what condition there in. and people wonder where all the jobs are.get the same at wall mart.
10882	clark's desert boots are real must have.there are few items like these. pair of levi's 501 jeans, brooks brothers button-down, bomber, some khakis... clark's originals desert boots definitely are in that row - style icons, that never dies.unbelievably comfortable. excellent material, very solid crepe sole. looks stunning.what else do men need?
10898	this is my third pair of the clark's desert boots. i own the beeswax and oakwood but this time i purchased the sand suede. amazon has it for $74 with free 2 day shipping and no tax which is much cheaper than anywhere else. the shoes themselves are excellent quality and extremely comfortable. i wear a 9 in nike's but for this i wear a 7.5. at first they may feel a little narrow, but they break in very quickly. i don't recommend tying these shoes too tight. buy a size that you can wear and have them not slip off while keeping the shoelaces kind of loose and that's how you are supposed to have these on. like with all suede shoes, put some protection on it before use.out of all the colors, i think i like sand suede the best. it seems to look great with almost everything. i find that i have to go up a half size in the beeswax or other leather ones, because they have less give and therefore fit a bit tighter especially cause my feet are semi wide.buy these shoes if you are on the fence, these are the pair you will never regret even if you spend full retail price of $110.
10927	i took a chance ordering dress shoes from amazon for the first time.  sizing is the concern for internet shoe sales, and will continue to be.the quality of the stitching and leather on this shoes is very high. they look as nice in real life as they do on the website.  excellent shoes.
10955	i wore wallabees in the 70's and i loved them to death. now, 40 some odd yrs. later it's time again to walk on clouds. i just got these today and they're as good today as they were way back then. superbly constructed and  comfortable, comfortable and more comfortable. i got the men's oily leather 'bees. the leather is first rate..thick, stable and soft to the touch. i can't imagine there will be any break-in necessary. my two suggestions might be...make them here in the usa and make different colored soles available. black or dark brown would go nicely on the bottoms of these shoes. the price here @ amazon was far and away the best i found anywhere. i ordered them on friday and they arrived on monday!!!! i ask you now, can it get any better than that??? go get you a pair!!
10978	"i wanted a light, skirt length ""bathrobe"" without a tie at the waist (i wish i had a waist), and this fit me welland is attractive and easy to put on and take off. this is called a ""house coat"", the same style is also called a ""model coat"" on some other websites."
10998	keep in mind that these earrings aren't particularly large, but for me they were the perfect size.  lovely quality, beautiful colors.  am very happy with my purchase.
11038	these earrings are really pretty & show so many cool colors! they look great with so many outfits. love them!
11056	the earrings are very well made like the name indicates, if you do not own any swarovski anything......these are a great introduction to the craftmanship. multi faceted and the colors that reflect from these beauties are very inpressive as swarovski is know for. very pleased with the purchase and great price as well as excellent arrival time as amazon is known for.
11059	luv the clip on with my arthritis in my hands. so pretty how the light shines thru the earring. will order again.
11095	my kind of sweats.  relaxed fit.  color stands up to numerous cleanings.  very reasonably priced.  good service by company.  have worn them a lot since purchase.
11097	"don't buy these. unless you can pick them up for $5, they are just likely to be one of those gotcha buys that will haunt your nightmares for years to come.i bought several pairs of these two years ago. they appeared to be part of a product line that had some excellent hoodies which i had purchased initially. i've regretted these sweatpants ever since and have just ended up hiding them under one of the various and sundry heaps in my closet.the worst thing about these pants is the fabric. it is thin, it is so thin that i can feel even slight breezes coming through the legs. the fleece on the inside of each leg does nothing to help with this or to give the pants a more luxurious feel. when i put these on, the fabric alone screams, ""cheap!"" at me.but that's not all. the legs are cut too long in proportion to the waistline. this wouldn't be a problem if the result was just a fashionably baggy appearance. however, in both of my pairs of pants, the elastic in the bottoms is weaker than a 10 yo rubber band. as a result, the bottoms are constantly dragging on the floor and getting in the way of my feet. i finally got the clips that cyclists use for their cuffs. this helps a little but is also unnecessarily inconvenient.last, i have not found the drawstring to be terribly useful. rather than ending in two strings that i can securely knot, the drawstring is just one continuous loop that is much more difficult to secure. this is perhaps the most minor of the problems, since i can always just cut the drawstring in half. i've been reluctant to do that, though, because this is often just a recipe for losing the string altogether.companies often modify their styles in the course of different production runs. possibly the problems i've noted have been corrected. however, this purchase has left me feeling sufficiently burned that i am not likely to make a return to the scene of the crime to try my luck yet again."
11224	i have very flat feet and have all my life.  i've had corrective surgery to align my feet, but they're still flat.  because they're flat, my feet are also prone to ligament inflammation without proper support.  all of these factors considered, i live in a constant struggle to find a comfortable shoe.  i usually wear tennis shoes with custom orthotics in them, but for a day at the beach, this is a problem.  i can't hold flip flops on comfortably (and they have absolutely no support!) so i needed a sandal that could hold itself on.  i tried columbia techsun 2 sandals, which i thought would be great, until i walked through the bahamas in misery and ended up with blisters.i researched walking sandals for hours and hours until i finally settled on the keens. they are a bit pricey, but any shoe that i can walk in without pain is totally worth it to me.  i've never had a more comfortable pair of shoes straight out of the box.  it's rare that i find shoes that i can wear for miles and not have something rub me or that make my knees and back ache. they'd be cuter without the big black toe guard, but i'll probably come to appreciate that feature of the shoe.  (it would be nicer if it was the same color as the straps of the shoe.)  i bought them to use on trips, but i have a feeling that when summer comes, these will be the only shoes on my feet.  i've already raved so much about them that i'm ordering a pair for my husband right now!my husband and i both wore these on a recent trip to the caribbean and they were invaluable.  in san juan, puerto rico, i walked at least 8 miles in my keens and didn't even think about my feet.  they were so comfortable and i was especially impressed with the grip of the soles on wet rocks.  at the end of the day, i was so happy that i didn't have any blisters and my feet still felt good.  i also wore these on the beach in the bahamas and they dried very quickly in the sun.  i will never take a trip without these shoes again!  i'm now thinking that i need these in other colors!if you have flat feet or fallen arches, i would recommend these shoes for you.  i couldn't be happier with them!
11228	my jansport driver 8 is a used one i got on amazon. i suppose you could say it's been around the block... i fumigated it.mine seems to be well made. fairly good materials. the handle is intact and extends/retracts as it should. it is long enough when extended. it seems to be well anchored to the pack! the pack is light weight. it has good wheels that spin freely but they show signs of wear. they appear to be replaceable. the pack is just about the right size too.the shoulder straps store in a pouch until needed. mine will see action on a trip across southern europe in 2012. we travel as cheaply as possible!i give it 5 stars because though it is used it is still in good shape!
11288	wow, this backpack is incredibly roomy. i am using it to hold all of our &#34;in case of a zombie apocalypse&#34; emergency supplies. i thought i would need two backpacks to hold everything, but, no, it all fits easily into one bag.there are two huge main zippered compartments and several smaller ones (and even more compartments inside those compartments!). the straps are very sturdy and comfortable, even when holding a full pack. the backpack, overall, is of very high quality, but i love having the lifetime guarantee anyway. i also love the bright red color.in short, i am extremely happy with this purchase!
11313	"i have been a jansport junkie since i was in high school (many years ago).  i remember begging my mom for the black backpack with that tapestry looking strip across the front.  i was lucky enough that she bought it for me and thanks to their lifetime warrenty (it has been replaced for free 3 times now) i still have that backpack and it functions as my always packed bathroom travel bag.so i decided to go back to school to get a second major and didn't want to unpack my bathroom bag.  i began hunting for a jansport.  i ordered this bag in the tan color with the pink zippers.  i love it.  first of all it came with that wonderful tag that says ""lifetime warrenty on craftsmanship,"" second, it's larger and much more comfortable them my circa 1993 version.there are way more pockets then the old ones had.  right now in the large main pocket i have a precalculus book, chemistry book, microbiology book, and chemistry student guide.  in the second main pocket (the bulk of the packpack is separated into two parts) i have 3 spiral notebooks, 2 composition books, a ti calculator, and a pair of lab goggles. in the front pouch i have two full boxes of pencils, one box of pens, various items from my purse and two packs of gum.  then i found two more pockets and a little webbed thingy on the side for holding a bottle of water.  also in the front pouch is a little pocket made just for cell phones - nice touch.  i still have plenty of room for adding more crap should i want to... but i don't think i could lift it then.the whole exterior is made in that standard high test canvas that makes jansport bags last forever.  the inside separator between the two large pockets may be the first thing that goes - it's a much flimsier material.final verdict - it holds everything i need it to hold, has surprisingly comfortable straps, and appears very durable.  highly recommended for high school, college, weekend overnight bag, or laptop bag.  i do not recommend it for little ones as my 8 year old put it on and it almost swallowed him.edit- i have just ordered 2 more of these - one for each of my stepsons.  the bag has made it through almost a whole college semester with nary a scuff.  i love this bag.  i now have one in this black and white spastic mishmash color that matches my youngest's bike, and the one with the lions on it (looks like old heraldry) they are all shaped exactly the same and made just as durable."
11314	i have a worn airzuit model jansport backpack, which is no longer made.  it is more than 15 years old. i went all over the us, europe, mexico and turkey using it as my carry on luggage and day pack. the big student classic series backpack has flimsy zippers, zipper pulls, and fabric. the shoulder straps had thin, poorly padded straps. i read a review that was critical of this product, but thought that the reviewer was just a complainer. my mistake. i sent it back, and will get a minor repair done my backpack at a luggage repair shop. the big student backpack qualifies as a medium grade toy.
11373	my 6 year old wore his backpack completely out last year in kindergarten.  we've had this one three months and it shows little sign of wear so far.  i wanted one that was very durable, but also stylish and functional.  so far, this one fits the bill.
11416	i have a bunch of jansport items in this pattern (white with lavender spots) and they all feel kind of flimsy.  they're not lined, and the zippers feel a bit cheap.  but i only use them for travel, which is once a year or less, and they are so inexpensive that even if they break after one trip, i don't mind.
11430	"the bulova 98c62 marine star watch is diver's style quartz/electronic watch rated water resistant to 200 meters.  it has a blue face with large, luminous hour and minute hands, a red-tipped second hand and a day/date feature.  the dial itself has large luminous dashes at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions, an inverted luminous triangle at the 12 o'clock position and large luminous dots at the other positions.  marker luminosity fades rapidly, though, and becomes ineffective after about 20 minutes in the dark.  surrounding the dial is a classic unidirectional timing ring (rotates ccw) calibrated in increments of 10 with 60 click-stops per revolution (most diving watches have 120).  the ring presents very legible chrome figures on a blue background.  overall the watch is very easy to read (except in the dark after 20 minutes), even for those with poor close-up vision.  the screw-down crown with raised guard ridges to either side provides robust protection for this critical seal and helps assure the watches water resistance.  a hefty double-foldover stainless-steel bracelet with a built-in, deploy-able wet suit extension completes the package.i purchased this modestly priced watch for general use during an extended summer water-centric vacation at several east coast lakes and the atlantic ocean.  i needed a dependable yet expendable timepiece that was presentable enough to be worn in the water or out to dinner, and that could survive shallow diving, wake-boarding, tubing, swimming and rough physical labor.  since i had destroyed or damaged a number of other watches on similar vacations, the bulova was to be my ""beater"".  i'm happy to say that it came through this test with flying colors, and now two months into ownership it looks as good as new, and works even better.  how could it work better than new?  ah!  there's the catch with this product.  it's not built with any particular precision, from its timing to the smoothness and alignment of its moving parts.  for example, when received, the rotating ring was so stiff i had to put on a pair of mechanics gloves and apply major force to rotate it at all.  after deliberately rotating the ring over 300 times, with it clacking loudly at every click-stop, the ring became (almost) manageable.  paradoxically, i found the ring's slight bevel and serrated, yet glossy sides made it very hard to turn when gripping it from the edge.  the fix?  place the entire palm of you hand over the watch face and ring, squeeze with your palm and rotate.  now, two months later, the ring has lost more of its stiffness and is more user-friendly, but i would never depend on it in a serious dive - its too hard to use, making it too easy to make a mistake at a critical time.  and if you fuss with it in an office meeting, it will announce your boredom with pronounced clacking that has to be heard to be believed.hand alignment is another issue.  the second hand is not aligned with the tick marks on the inner chapter ring on the watch face, and the amount of misalignment changes as the hand rotates (how do they do that?) - it is greatest between 7 and 11 and minimal between 2 and 5.  the minute hand does not align well with its markers, either, when the second hand is in the 12 o'clock position.  while not visible from a distance, this lack of mechanical precision became annoying after awhile.concerning timing accuracy - compared to a mechanical watch, any mechanical watch, it is outstanding.  but as a quartz watch it is adequate yet unremarkable, gaining the equivalent of 70 seconds per year - twice as much as my plastic timex expedition.in summary, this is a modestly priced watch with modestly good looks and rather poor mechanical precision.  it has several key features that enhance its value:  1.  a protected screw-down crown that provides real and reliable water resistance, 2. a double fold-over bracelet that prevents accidental loss, 3.  a deployable wetsuit extension built into the clasp, 4.  a day/date display.  on the other hand, the need to break in the timing ring was just plain annoying.  a good value?  yes.  a great value?  you be the judge."
11463	"i was hoping to be able wear this more for the back support than the waist clinching, but it's digs into the area underneath my breasts and is uncomfortable for longer periods of time.  i purchased the ""blush"" color and it's a nice neutral beige color - i was a bit worried it would have a pinkish tint to it."
11471	i simply love it i think i'm to get two more.  i have  told several people about it.  ladies this is a must-have item.
11522	i have yet to recieve this item it's been 4 days past the estimated arrival date and i paid for 1 day shipping. i wanted to wear it for my birthday yesturday and i ended up having to go out the day of and buy my own at a store nearby. i'm very dissapointed and i plan to return it as soon as i get it! it may have been a good bra but it's worthless if it isn't delivered on time!!!!
11633	i really like these pants.  i use them as long johns so it is important that they fit tight without a bulky waistband.  i'm about to order several more pair and toss my old ones from the 90's that are full of holes.  (until i found these, they were the best i could do!)
11653	this is my 2nd pair of size 7 moccasins.  the fit perfectly and are very comfortable!  would definitely order the same in the future!
11725	i was excited to try out these cute moccasins, as i loved the other styles of minnetonka's i have owned.  however, after just 3 days of light wear, the lining of the soles are coming apart.  the glue has become gummy and lost its adhesiveness, so i am unable to put the liners back in place.  i am very disappointed in this product and i will think twice about buying another pair of minnetonka's.
11752	i bought these as a christmas gift for my husband, who never goes barefoot and in the winter constantly complains of cold feet.  he is now in 7th heaven.  loves them!
11769	i've had many types of minnetonka mocs but these were my first moose ones.  i'll never buy any other kind!  hardly know they are on my feet and truly soft.  love the hard sole and wear them out and about as well as for house shoes.  i wear a size 10 and while they fit a bit tightly when i first started wearing them, within days they broke in.  beware though... i wore some thick socks during cold weather and they stretched out a little more.  now almost floppy with regular socks.moose mocs are the most comfortable shoe i've ever worn in my life!  (hate to wear any other kind)
11800	i have bad feet & use birkenstock high arch orthotics in my shoes. merrells work so well since they have excellent mid foot support. due to a nerve condition in my feet, tarsal tunnel syndrome, i can not wear shoes with laces. merrells are the only brand of traditional shoes i have found that do not put my feet to sleep. they offer top of the line mid foot support at a great price. this pair is well made, but fit a tad bit big, but since i use orthotics, it worked perfect. the soles will slip on wet, but most shoes do. highly recommend.
11858	i wanted to have as close to original a pair of penny loafers.  i was going to a do wop party and needed to have something on my feet from the 50's.  they did the trick.  took a few days to break in and after that,  comfortable and look absolutely great.
11937	my son loves them. they're comfortable and fit well. skechers have now become our go to brand over new balance.
11987	i love these shoes.  i have three pairs of the exact style and color.  when one wears out, i move on to the next pair.  i always keep them in reserve, just in case they discontinue the color or the style.  great running and walking shoes and very comfortable if you stand on your feet all day.
12024	ordered a medium width. much too large in the heel area.for a walking shoe not very flexible and shoes seemed to be very heavy.quality of workmanship was excellent.shoes were returned to amazon with no problem.
12042	plain jane but hard worker.  look as pictured, run a tiny bit large but that's ok.  decent value, unflashy work shoe.
12065	i haven't ordered nice shoes online before and wasn't very confident that it would work out with sizing and such, but when i got these and tried them on they fit incredibly and they look amazing.  i will be wearing these to work now.  i can now trash my old bass shoes from 2002 that i tried to wear that looked horrible.  if you get the regular fit it is somewhat snug around the outside of your foot, but fits quite nicely.  if you want a little wiggle room get the wider fit.  great, fancy shoes that look fantastic with dress clothes.
12157	"these are excellent sturdy, comfortable, good looking work boots. the construction of these boots is first rate, solid stitching, and rugged lace eyelets. i like the slightly darker tan color of these boots.there is a bonus black engraved caterpillar bulldozer on the heel. i like that touch a lot. cat is visible at the very top of the boot. the yellow and black is not obnoxious at all.these are rugged insulated boots. they are not safety boots with steel toes.there is a slightly cheaper alternative to this boot, the cactus 6"" work boot, (cactus 6'' classic boots). i purchased both caterpillar and cactus boots. to me the caterpillar boot is better, but slightly more expensive. if you are very cost conscious, then the cactus boot might be a better choice.i like this boot a lot. the cat logo is cool to me. i expect these will wear like iron and last a long time."
12277	my little cowboy is in love with this toy gun!  it is sturdy and alot more durable than most of those plastic cheapies out there!  it also have impressive little details.  great toy
12315	i have two pairs of these, and like the fact that they don't reveal a panty line, but they tend to run a bit tight and small, and don't have much stretch to them.  i prefer the maidenform flirty tanga, which is cotton and a bit stretchier.  since comfort can be a matter of personal preference, though, i'd suggest buying a pair in a few styles to see which pair is most comfy before stocking up on them.overall, i'd give these 3 1/2 stars.
12378	great except for one very important problem:  they don't flex at all in the toe region. i wore them around the house and my first mtp joints started smarting after about an hour. toe flexibility is very important! i returned them without any problems there, and that's why i'm giving them two stars.
12407	these earrings are absoultely devine and prettier than pictured.  i am very pleased with the mix of jewels and colors.my only comnplaint is the cheap silver -it leaves tarnish marks on the earlobe.pros:uniquensscolordesignsizeleverbackcons:silver leaves tarnish marks on earlobe
12571	got these for all my husband's groomsmen at our wedding. they looked great. not sure how they'd hold up over time.
12606	these athletic pants run 1 size large.  i'm 6'0 and am between 34-36x32 in regular pant size.  i've ordered the large size and while they functioned well, they were very baggy in the thigh area, with a very odd, low hanging inseam.  the elastic waist band kept them on snugly, but still too baggy for my liking.i ordered medium size and now they fit perfectly, but they are a touch short for my height.extremely comfortable and well priced, but the fitment disparities are a bit extreme.
12611	never had a problem with em. drawstring is good. elastic is good. sizing is spot on.
12629	i love these shirts.  i wear them under my uniform and they do help keep you cooler.
12725	i felt like my 44d boobs were being herded into industrial-style containers.  wow, it definitely supports them, and they'd better not ask questions!!!i went around all day feeling like my boobs were 'out there', well-managed, and not going anyplace.it's not something i'd buy again - it's just a bit too uncomfortable - like they were stitched from the same material used to make backpacks, but the one i have will probably last a good while.2 stars because it is indeed well-constructed.  somebody at playtex said, by golly, i wanna design a bra that means it!
12751	ok, so the bra fits nice, minor inconvenience with the straps.  if you aren't looking to lift them up as high as an underwire - than this is for you.  while this is great weekends i would prefer one that lifts and separates more.  however, for the price it will do just fine.1.24.12 - i put this through the wash after one wearing and now the bottom elastic keeps rolling up causing painful marks.  did it shrink?
12774	this bra has been on the market many years. there is a reason for it. it is a very good supporting bra. the straps stay up without digging into shoulders. the band around the back is  wide enough that it doesn't fold up. the cups do provide definition which i personally like. to say it makes one look like madonna is a misnomer. if it did i would never take it off! ;-)
12887	when a company like levi's, a staple of american society, starts taking the quaility of their merchandise so low that it is this noticable, we are all in trouble.  i have 550s from 2 years ago and 550s that i got today and they are sooo far below the quality of material and weight of the previous pair that i thought they were fake.  so now where are you supposed to go to get quality jeans?  sad.
12896	there is a reason the levis brand is synonymous with jeans.  they are simply the best.  nothing else compares.the moment you pickup these jeans, you can feel the sturdy construction and quality.  these jeans are heavy.  the material is strong and durable.  these are some fly-by-night jeans that will rip if you sneeze.  these are the real deal.putting them on reveals a loose fit.  the jeans wrap around your waist but leave enough room for plenty of movement.  the legs taper slight but will easily fit over a pair of construction or work boots.  the seams and ends of the legs are double-stitched to prevent fraying and tears.the pockets are deep and roomy.  i can easily fit an ipod in one front pocket and a large set of keys (almost 40 keys) into the other.  you could unload several rolls of quarters and still have room for your hand.  the back pockets are just as roomy and can hold wallets, tools, flashlights (including a mag-light), and more.accept no substitutes.  if you want the best, get these jeans.  they won't let you down.
12898	"the fit on these ""relaxed"" jeans is just that--relaxed but not loose. compared to other manufacturers relaxed fit jeans, these are less full than you might expect. i find them to be something like a cross between the classic ""regular"" fit zipper fly 505, and the slightly wider thigh fit of the 501 button fly levi's. in other words, they are somewhat fuller in the seat and thighs, but not much fuller in the waist. they are good looking, and have a slight taper to the leg. because of the taper, they get pretty narrow near the ankle so you want to order your exact size--these are not jeans to roll up the cuffs"
13172	showing of nipples dew to not enough padding but it fits exact an comfortable.  true to colour and very nice fit
13193	i used this bra when i was pregnant and it was very comfortable for around the house.  however, it has a very pointy/cone shape that does not match my body, so it looked funny through shirts.  i did not wear this out of the house.
13199	i just love this bra.  i was first introduced to playtex when my doctor's nurse suggested that i buy something good when i was expecting - and not victoria's secret!  playtex's maternity bras are virtually indestructable and i just loved those.  so, i changed to these because quite frankly, you're not the same after nursing but this bra does the trick.  the support is just wonderful, but you don't feel like you are wrapped up tight in a sheet tied with a rubber band either.  it's a very comfortable bra and i wear them all the time.  they last a long time through the washings and come out looking great.  i'm so glad that i found something that works without feeling like i'm dressed in something that makes you feel like you're in a straight jacket.  the underwire isn't even noticeable, another great plus.  i'll be wearing just these as long as they make them!  plus, they provide nice coverage too.
13202	i like this bra as i like the fit and the underwire is comfortable. the only thing i would suggest is for the straps to be more substantional, especially for size d and above. i do have trouble with one strap slipping off my shoulder.. also, i like when bra straps can be adjusted from the front instead of having to remove bra to adjust the straps like which has to be done with this one.
13228	this bra looks nice on, and the straps are super comfy.  but it runs small and there's nothing worse than a day in an underwire that is torturing your ribs!the lacy design is nice, but on a tight tee shirt the raised lace shows through...a plain bra is better for that.  i thought the price was great though.
13233	the bra has no support at all for an underwire bra, will not buy this bra again.  use to lounge around house, cannot wear under good clothing because no support.
13238	this bra fits true to size and the straps are so comfortable that i forget they are there, having said that...i dont forget that the bra itself is there. the lace in the front kind of digs in after a few hours and starts to hurt and the wire on the side eventually start digging in but all in all this is a good comfortable bra that doesnt give you a funny shape
13300	this is my first pair of ray bans.  these are great sunglasses.  they're a little heavier than other sunglasses since they're glass lenses, but definitely worth it and definitely a better price here than at the mall!
13322	i love raybans and been shopping around for a pair of aviators i like for a while now. i tried the larger, 62mm model, but they were waay too large for my face. i knew from previous experience that the 52 is too small, so, like goldilocks, the third pair was jusssst right.shipping was fast, the frames seem legit. i had some concerns buying them online, but i've compared them to the frames sold at sunglass hut and they're a match!lenses are crisp and clear, and though i didn't spring for the polarized version, i'm very pleased with them. i've had these for around six weeks and they show minimal signs of wear. very delicate though, so keep the case with you!!!
13428	what can i say? these shoes are classic, and have great quality. not for people with wide feet though. i would say if your foot is other than slender you might want to find another shoe. with that in mind it is a nice shoe.
13430	i'm a minimalist wallet kind of guy. i was looking for something to hold about ten cards (credit/id/medical) and a few bills. and i wanted them all to be easy to access. the wallets i've found so far are either too bulky or require bills to be carefully folded. once i placed a couple of cards in this wallet, getting bills in and out of the center fold was nearly impossible.i designed and made my own duct-tape wallet which works perfectly and which will have to suffice until i can find a more durable (and classy...) leather equivalent.
13449	there aren't a lot of options for quality front pocket wallets, i reluctantly gave this one a shot and it's amazing!  slim, small yet full of storage solutions.  i've never been pleased with a wallet before, this wallet has changed my tune.  i've only had it for a few months now, but i carry it daily and it has no concerning wear, the corners and seams are like new.  the only wear i notice is on the top/bottom side (depends how you look at it) opposite the window will show marks from the credit card numbers, this is only a minor inconvenience and can be neutralized by rotating the orientation of ones credit cards.if you're on the fence about this and looking for a slim, light and storage loaded front pocket wallet give it a try.
13468	wow were have these been all my life. but now that i am older these hold me together in a very fine way! my husband thinks i lost weight but i am just tucked into my spanx bra and panties! very comfortable to wear all day and travel in.
13478	these pantyhose definitely &#34;tighten&#34; things up, but also make things bulge in some spots. kinda uncomfortable but not too bad.i am 5'6&#34; 135 and b was perfect for me.
13548	i can't believe how confortable these slippers are! they do have a noticable arch support that is just what i needed and a wonderfully soft memory foam foot bed. also the slipper fabric is very soft--like walking on a cloud. would definately purchase these again--in fact i bought pink and an thinking about also purchasing the black.
13586	i ordered them because they are isotoner slippers at a good value.  they are very sofrt and comfortable, and i enjoy the fact that they are clogs.
13589	the slippers are a perfect fit, easy to walk in (no slipping) and they keep my feet warm. i ususally don't like clogs but these are fine.
13661	like other reviewers i found these to be too narrow for tapered slip on shoes. they don't stretch as advertised. size may be good for 13 certainly not large enough for size 14 feet. returned the product
13756	i'm giving these 3 stars because of sizing although these sweatpants are a nice weight and great for the money.  but !!! way too big for me and i'm disappointed returning them.  i am small size (my measurements waist 30 hips 38).  the tape measurement on these at the hip is 50!
13773	i ordered an  xx-large, and they lookd liked a size medium---very, very small, especially considering sweats are generally loose and baggy at any size. i don't know if they were mislabeled or what, but i sure wouldn't order again. too much hassle to return so i just gave them away.
13778	me llego el producto asi como me dijeron a la fecha acordada, con respecto a la tela es genial me gusto el dise&ntilde;o.
13787	the shirt is just what i thought it would be and came in a timely manner.
13827	i am so glad i bought this coat.  i've had it for a few years now and it is still in great shape. it's very comfortable. people compliment me on it all the time. you should get this jacket.
13889	excellent trousers! has ordered the size 38\34 - my size. conformity ideal. thanks the manufacturer and seller essential apparel. has ordered in this seller of 6 jeans and 1 trousers - it is happy on 100 %. lacks aren't present!
13935	muy buen yeans queda muy bien y buen precio me parece una exlente opcion lo recomiendo a los que les sirva
14102	it's true - these jeans are the perfect fit for me.  i'm used to buying jeans that are just a little too long, or a little too &#34;relaxed&#34;, or a little too snug in the crotch. on a whim, i bought a pair of these at a local sear's store, and joy of joys, they fit perfectly!  so much so that i went back the next day and bought two more pairs.  which leads me to the next positive thing about them - the color selection.  i can buy these in colors that make them acceptable to wear as &#34;business casual&#34; attire at work, which means every day is jeans day!  anything that you can match khaki's with, you can find a color in these jeans to do the same thing.  i'm hooked!
14118	at 5'0&#34; i love finding good pants i don't have to shorten! these were a great fit. not the sexiest, most stylish jeans in the world but for the price the fit was awesome. so 3 stars for comfort and fit, took 2 away because i can't say these were amazing. they are mom jeans! ;)2013 was the year i finally said enough and have been working to lose weight. at almost 60 pounds, i am trying to not buy a ton of clothes because i intend to keep losing. so i have been trying to find 2 or 3 things i can wear for a while and move on. things i can wear through a size or 2 with a good belt :)as i was making my way towards 16 i got these because they had the elastic as i wasn't totally there yet. now i am at a 14 and these are actually too big now and are working with a belt. they are comfortable, they are warm (i live in chicago) they are fitting the bill. great fit. if they had these in 14 i would buy them to keep me going down.
14121	"i love these jeans.  because of the little bit of spandex they put in, they are so comfortable.  but please, get more of the ""bleach"" back in stock in the larger sizes so i can buy some more.i did a review on full-length jeans.  why is there now a photo of capris here?  what's going on?"
14122	these fit as i expected and i like them a lot better than the relaxed fit.  these felt like true jeans and wore well.  i haven't had the chance to wash them after one wearing so i may return to edit my review.  seems like a good jean that i will get lots of wear.
14135	i have purchased these jeans for about 10 years.  they wear well, are comfortable, and have no back pockets to wear holes in the fabric at the upper tack stitching.  i hope lee never discontinues this style!
14152	these are some very kool jeans. i usally buy wrangler regular fit or levi's 505 jeans. but while searching amazon i came across these lees carpenter jeans and thought what the hell, try something different. so along with a pair of dickies overalls i ordered these because i am tired of wearing the same jeans day in and day out. i was hoping they would not be too loose because i am on the thin side. when they arrived and i tried them on i sure was glad to see they were not really loose at all and they actually fit me. it's nice wearing something different for a change and i like all of the pocket locations. especially the shallow watch pocket where you can put something into and get to it easily rather than be fishing down deep for it. i like the back pockets too that aren't down too low, and your wallet is next to your butt and not halfway down your leg. i have washed and dried these twice with no shrinkage so just order your normal size and you should be fine as far as the fit. what i really like about shopping for jeans on amazon is the incredible selection of not only brands and styles, but of all the various versions, like stonewashed, light stonewashed, stressed, black, white, different colors and so on. there is no store i have ever been to with that kind of selection. i am all for supporting my local retail stores but this you can't beat. that's it!
14255	would be a good shirt for working outside when the temperature is a little chilly.  the picture gave more an impression of it being a better type sweatshirt.  i was disappointed.
14414	i recently decided to challenge myself and start running, possibly training for a marathon and eventually sprint triathlons.  i needed a watch that would help keep track of my mile pace and split times and would have never thought i would go back to an lcd screen watch!  based upon all the amazon reviews, they are all on spot so i will try not to repeat what everyone else has already covered, but what was important to me.it's funny to say, but i actually had to read the instructions to acclimate myself, going back to the dinosaur ages of using buttons that have multiple functions!  we are so spoiled with color touch screens that are intuitive and easy to use.  re-learning how to use this watch brought me back to my childhood days when i used to wear a casio g-shock chronograph watch!  needless to say, the learning curve is short.i guess i will touch up upon the 100 memory function.  every time you use the chronograph and track your split times, you have the option to save that particular workout for future reference.  for example.  on 9-10-11, i ran 3 miles, each mile i pushed the split/start button, the watch counts that as lap 1 and records your time.  when you are done, push the button that says stop.  not the split/start button!  you save the workout and can go back to it based upon the date.  3 laps = 3 units of memory and the watch will indicate 97 memory (remaining).  when you review your 10-10-11 workout, you can view your lap 1-3 split times, it will give you your best time, and will automatically average your 3 laps.  i never thought i would use this feature, however if you run often and want to track your progress, i think it's a great feature.  my one gripe about using the split/start button is, it's not a distinct click, it's soft and mushy even though i have my watch beep when pressing buttons, i can't always hear it.  it could be my particular watch, but every time i use the split button i look at my watch to make sure it worked.the big display size is important to me because i want to focus on running instead of trying to squint and figure out what my pace time is.  you do have the option of switching your split and total time on your display....meaning your pace time can be where the time reads (larger numbers), and your total time is where the date reads (smaller numbers).  it just depends on what is more important to you.  the indiglo flix system lets you flick your wrist and the indiglo light turns on for a brief 3 seconds.  i found this very convenient not to use your other hand to turn on the light while running.  i wish timex could figure out a similar way to do a one handed split.  i have read that the indiglo doesn't last too long -- about 1 year, but i guess it depends on how often it is used.  hopefully that isn't the case.overall, this watch is simplistic in form but functions very well as a training tool and as an everyday watch!  i enjoy using it and i hope it lasts a very long time.
14428	i've worn timex ironman watches for the past 13 years.  this was the first time i switched to the sleek version, and so far (4.5 months later), i'm still pretty happy with this watch.the sleek styling is more attractive for everyday wear than the original ironman, but still maintains the functionality.  the face is a bit small for reading numbers while running, and i don't use it for serious training (i use a garmin forerunner 305), but for a casual run concerned with elapsed time, this is more than adequate.  i wear it with most outfits, except for business attire or evening wear.the grap and purple color is feminine but subdued, and i've received several compliments on it.i like that just the numbers light up when using the indiglo, meaning that it is much more discreet if you are in a darkened auditorium or theater and need to check the time.  it does not glow like a small flashlight.the paint is starting to chip off the face, but not very much.  the paint on the buttons is about halfway gone.
14486	i purchased birkenstocks the arizona leather sandal in picante through amazon. i love orange and they are just what i wanted. softer leather, in the orange family. they were delivered on time and as advertised. yea birkenstocks
14489	after reading other reviews saying these sandals run a little big, i ordered them in the narrow instead of the regular.  they fit perfectly.  the leather is thick and smooth, and the color is a beautiful, saturated aqua blue.  the color looks more like denim in the picture, but it's actually a bit more turquoise, which is what i really like, so i was very happy when i got them.  after wearing them for about a half hour, they were already starting to break in.  i've been wearing birkenstocks for many years, and these are exactly what i expected for fit and comfort.
14510	i have the genuine leather ones, and i see that these say they're faux leather..apart from that,they look identical to mine, which i acquired when someone on a parent cyber forum decided to sell off some mint-condition birkies in my size.well, so i was pleased by the arch support etc and wore them home...but had to stop and take them off with big blisters.  after that, i was leery...but now i've gone back to them. again, they are wonderfully supportive of your foot but so painful on top where the uppers chafe against the skin, no matter what setting you have the buckle at, so you have to carry around boxes of bandaids, and even so my right foot is very red and tender a day later, and i am deliberating whether to give up on this 'breaking in' experiment/torture.i'm not sure why the uppers can't be made super-soft in some way, but it's a real shame because it lets the shoe down.  i should think the rigidity of the soles, and the weight they have, makes the problem worse.  i've now tried wearing them a number of times, and i don't see any improvement.  i may give up on these shoes now. i'm not one of those who walk around in socks and sandals...just looks awful.
14522	it was enormous.  ordered 38m for daughter who wears size 7; the 38 was even too large for me who wears 8 or 8 1/2.  return was easy with online process and printing of the label.  unclear if the problem was unisex sizing or if, in fact, birkenstock runs huge despite the sizing chart.  their website was of no help.  yay for amazon for their return process.
14526	needed something comfortable for the summer and these are going to fill that void.  so far they are excellent and very comfortable.  i would buy these again and may even buy another pair in a different color later this season.  if you are tempted by these, take the leap.
14579	i have been wearing birkenstock bostons for more than 20 years. i depend on the excellent arch support. for those of us who have to wear orthopedic shoes, birkenstocks are lifesavers.
14590	this is the third pair of snakeskin footwear that i have purchased from giorgio brutini and each purchase has provided me with unsurpassed style and craftsmanship.  i love them and i receive numerous glowing compliments on the look.
14616	smartwool socks have proven over and over to be the best sock overall.  they last much longer than other socks, conform to the foot nicely, and keep feet cool in warm weather and warm in cool weather.  i live in florida and wear them all summer long.  i also wore them in the mountains of colorado in the winter, and they did wonders there also.  the material is comfortable, it is not pure wool.  it has enough elasticity to conform to the foot and is not at all itchy, and i tend to be sensitive to the normal itchiness of wool.this particular &#34;model&#34; tends to run a little small.  i bought the size i normally wear and the heel part of the sock tends to sit just underneath my heel rather than on it, which means that the reinforcement there does no good.my rule of thumb for smartwool is to buy one size larger than you would normally wear for the thinner ones, like margarita and saturnsphere, and one size smaller for the thicker socks (unless you are going to layer another pair underneath) like the phd socks.  this makes the socks fit well, keeps the reinforced heel where it is supposed to be, and helps avoid excessive movement of the sock in your shoes (for the thicker types).
14655	i was a little disapppointed in the belt because it wa not a government issued  belt but instead it's &#34;style&#34;. the cost was low and i can find a use for it.
14752	purchased these hoping they would be cute and comfortable.  someone in my family has worn these every day for years.  unfortunately, for me they are not true to size.  they fit small and dig into my heels.  for this reason, i do not wear them.  but, service from amazon was great as always.
14771	wasn't sure if size large would fit. i wear a size 8 1/2 in a shoe. perfect fit when i got them. soft and comfy. they look good and are just the thing for wearing around the house. they would make a nice gift too.
14826	i am 6' 3&#34; and weigh 195 this shirt is an xl. the shirt fits great and looks good. i really like the blue color of the garment, a very nice shade.  couldn't be more pleased with this purchase.
14832	love carhartt gear.  these shirts are very nice.  high quality stitch.  you can feel the quality of the shirt the fist time you put it on.  the shirt is cut very well to fit.  the only down side is that it has a bit too much shrink after the first wash.  i would recommend going one size larger to account for the shrink.  i will buy again.
14838	this is a nice heavy henley shirt, an excellent value for the price.  they hold up well in washing -- no frayed seams, no lost buttons.  as someone else mentioned, they run a *little* large, but i prefer a loose fit anyway.  (yeah, i'm a female, but i like to wear these as nightshirts ... )  you can find tee shirts cheaper than this, but they'll be made of much thinner material.
14977	this shirt is a beautiful color and the material is nice and soft.  it fits my husband perfectly and looks great on.  can't go wrong with this purchase.  delivered ahead of scheduled time which is always a delight.
14980	for some reason, i can't find this style locally. my son needed some shirts dressier than a t-shirt, but didn't want button-ups or d-bag designs printed on them. these look very nice and the price is great! the fabric is soft, washes well and is comfortable. it shrank a very small amount with the first time in the dryer, but all shirts with cotton will do that. it even packs well without wrinkling too much. the fabric isn't super-thick. i'd say just right.  bargain! i'll be buying more.
14999	after decades of dealing with rl shirts that don't last and cost 10x more (not an exaggeration), i find these to be a better fit and value.i started buying these in long sleeve and got one in short sleeve by accident when i changed to sandstone and the picture showed long sleeve white. being a prime order, i figured if it wasn't right when it arrived, i would ship it back. well, color was nice, but it came as short sleeve. a happy accident because i would never have started ordering these if i hadn't discovered how much better these were than my polos.i order mediums. the order choices show s,m,l, and on and on. then, they say adult s, adult m, adult l, etc. since they don't say child s,m.... i took a chance on the lower prices that came with the exclusion of the word adult. i'll have to assume adult label must be a euphemism for b&t; or something else associated with extra roomy because i'm not child size.i'm currently a 44-36. the waste is loose enough to hide less than flat abs. the shoulders fit without hanging over and don't look sloppy yet still have a lot of room in the chest and body. length was great for low cut jeans, but too much if not tucked in. much more suited to being tucked in to deal with below waste jeans issues. i actually found myself returning for a small which is really strange sizing.i gave very little thought to the claim of spot protection until i watched salsa disappear with just a wet sponge.so far they are holding up through washes but i caution anyone who does not thoroghly understand how laundry machines work. you cannot use high heat and the toughest cycle for every type of garment. unless you are wearing these on a construction job and letting it sit for a week before washing, you should use gentle wash cycles and low heat drying with finish guard sensor dryers. if you don't have access to proper dryers or time to watch over timed laundromat machines, remove while slightly damp and use hangers for final drying. everything will last longer with more care, regardless.
15047	shorts are sized to fit.  there is no pocket on them.  elastic works great.  has a drawstring.  good value for the money.
15052	ordered 1 blue and 1 gray based on previous jerzees shirt. these two did not disappoint. fit is just what i expected. material is very good fabric. hopefully i will not have to test the spotshield treatment for a very long while. i recommend these jerzees to anyone who is looking for a nice shirt at a very reasonable price.
15057	nice shirt, a little thin but it is excatly what i expected for the price. i'll wear it in the office.
15097	i hate tank tops that ride up but this one doesn't!!  it's the perfect length.  i haven't put it in the dryer yet - i have just been air drying it so i can't tell you if it will shrink or not.  but the price was good and the color is nice and the shipping was fast.
15109	trying to find comfy sweatpants for my size (short legs, thick waist) is a nightmare. i love this sweats, they are soft and warm and attractive. so nice!
15127	please see my review on the &#34;jerzees 1/4 zip cadet collar sweatshirt&#34;.  it took me about 2 or 3 hours to match these two up.  the colors and materials are a perfect match.  they are an awesome set together and both of first line quality and workmanship.
15199	will buy more. better than biv box shirts, and lower priced. i like good deals; they're here for the looking.
15231	this shirt is a high quality shirt, but it is too large for hubby. i got him an x-l but when it arrived it looked like it could fit two dinosaurs.
15256	i like comfy t-shirts so i ordered this one. i usually wear large or xl so i purchased a xl. it was to tight and to short.
15265	i got 3 of these to wear under things. nice and thick which i like. will keep me warm, not something you could wear in the summer or you'd get too hot, but that's what short sleeves are for. they were a good price and seem better made than something you get from old navy. they fit just right before i washed them, but i just pulled them out of the dryer and they look like they shrunk. i haven't tried them on to see if they still fit. next time i'd probably order a large just because i like things with a little room (i'm a size 4-6).
15271	i was searching for a silver pendant i could wear with various silver earrings. this is it! i love it...just the right scale and is light. the pendant is slightly concave though, which means the sharp points of the flower edges poke a bit, but i'll get used to that. it's quite shiny, in a good way. highly recommended!
15314	"these are very attractive earrings, but note that the 1.25 inches is overall length. the crystal part is probably less than 1/2"" across. one thing these do, is to pick up colors of objects around them, so presumably, they could be worn with almost anything."
15318	i love threader earrings, especially swarovski crystal earrings.  these are very pretty; however, they are a little longer than most.  also, be sure to wear the backs on them since the crystal is a little weighty, it pulls the earrings down.  you don't want to loose them.
15329	i don't know what was wrong on this page before, but i took the chance,  got what i expected, and it is great. pretty, silky, feminine, and comfy to wear with my just-below-the-waist jeans and slacks. no panty-line because of the wide stretch lace band.after buying one to check it out, i came back and bought more.revised review 2/2/2013 - still love them. worth every penny. if you do not order the correct product or size, or especiall y do not have amazon verified purchase by your review, why give bad ratings? amazon accepts returns and will refund, credit, or replace, so i tend to think these are non-reviews from people who sell competing products.i have digestive disease. waistline comfort is difficult to find for me, with a huge scar up beside my bellybutton - i buy v-waistlines and these wonderful scoops half pants. along with yoga foldover waistline, they solve my comfort problems.
15403	very nice shawl, looks just like advertised, dosent feel right tho, this is the second pashmina i have bought, the first one is much heavyer,thicker and softer than this one. this one feels more like some kind of acrilic blend. i like it tho and since i only paid $10 for it im gonna wear it anyway.
15414	"i love the weight and feel of these shawls. i now have 6 of them in all different colors. the price is right. i recently saw someone selling very similar shawls for $6.00. they were 100% acrylic. the shawls at sharkas are the ""real deal"" and much better quality."
15430	they say if something is priced too good, buyer beware. so true of this purchase!  the 'crystals' i received had almost no sparkle to them with the exception of a few colors.  the supplier is being misleading calling them 'swarovsky crystals', to say the least!  i didn't return them only because it wasn't worth the cost.
15441	these are nice slippers, the stitching looks good and the soles are fairly heavy although i think they should have a little more tread. these run small, i got a size bigger than i wear and they fit but they are narrow at the toe but i think they should stretch since they are leather.
15455	if only these came in a double wide...they were exactly what my husband needed for working on his boat without damaging the surface, but they were just too narrow for his feet.
15471	was wearing those all summer. love them! so comfortable and good looking, and you can walk all day long in those, feeling that you wear flats. as always, jambu exceeds my expectations.
15480	the shirts mostly fit well.my son isn't 18 months old yet, but he wears 18 month cloths in nearly every brand. the fit everywhere except the shoulders. the neck opening is a little too loose, and when he's running around it will sometimes slide off of one shoulder or the other. if we put a t-shirt over this shirt, it works perfect.
15481	these are our favorite onesies for our boys. the cotton is really soft and they wash well. a lot thicker and softer than the carters or gerbers.
15532	these onezies are made of nice cotton (thicker and softer than usual).  they are a little wider (around the trunk) than the ones from old navy.  the opening around the neck is a bit wide and when you put the baby's head through it, the fabric folds that form the opening (on the shoulders) do not close up nicely. they tend to bunch up. the snaps are better than on the cheaper gerber onezies, but not as nice as the old navy ones.  overall these onezies are better than the ones from gerber but not as great as the old navy ones.
15536	these body suits are excellent.  they were a great fit and soft and thick, but stretchy.  the problem with some other brands is that they are either too thin or the fabric doesn't give. these were perfect. i'm glad i found them.
15595	bought 2 of these in the forest green for a st. patty's day party.  these are a medium weight sweat, solidly built, good cuffs on sleeves and waist.  not tight.  the sweat itself fits a bit large, but for me it is very comfortable.  if you want it to fit tight on the body, you might want to size down.  i dno't want it tight, so i ordered my regular size and the fits is just right.  color on screen is about right - this is a very dark green.
15678	i am returning it. i wanted something small just for my phone, id and money that i could use hands free. my phone will not fit in it.
15687	too small to fit two sets of keys (house and car), a mobile and cards / cash. i returned it.
15705	"i bought this for my almost 7 year old son.  he's tall and skinny.  in the waist, he's still a size 6.  in the length, he needs a size 7.  the size medium fit well, although i needed to take in the collar a bit.the quality of this costume is not especially high - i don't think this is one that will last a long time.  however, for under $15, i wouldn't expect anything more.the pants have an easy fit with an elastic waist, and they are not too baggy on him.  the material is a bit sheer, and darker underwear could be seen through the white stripes.  the shirt/vest is one piece.  the front of the shirt is a sort of pleather, so it looks a bit like a leather vest.  the diagonal brown belt is just printed on the vest.  i think our sash is a bit shorter than pictured, but that doesn't bother us.  the head wrap is a nice touch, and i think it looks very cute on my son.overall, this is definitely a ""buy.""  my son loves it, and he's worn it twice already.  it's comfortable, and the price is low enough so it doesn't matter if it doesn't last."
15768	these are so thick you may need to go up a size in your running shoes! but they are very comfortable.
15793	i bought these socks for normal, around the house wear and absolutely love them.  they're not too thick and bulky yet they're not paper thin either.  just right.  they feel comfortable - almost like they were custom made for my foot.  i'm now a thorlo convert.  there's just no reason to buy anything else!.
15814	these socks are constructed well and have held up to multiple machine washings, but i personally don't like the bulk. i bought them when training for a half marathon. they make my feet feel a bit crowded in my shoes, so i now wear them for casual walking only. the sweat wicking does work so my feet don't get hot.
15830	ok heres the scoop. i needed some god sock to hike in. then play deck hockey in. also to work in and walk in and just to have for daily use.  i love these socks, they are super comfy and seem to dry off from your sweat real quick.  my feet feel magnanimous after wear them, even after wearing work boots all day.  they are well worth the price. i am slowly buying more and rotating my old boring white walmart socks out of rotation and turning them into rags.
15881	i wear uniform danner boots everyday at work. i needed a sock that is comfortable for this type of wear. this sock is extremely thick and made my normally comfortable boots hot and uncomfortable.
15918	got boots? got cold weather? these are the socks!they are cushioned, warm, and strong. your big little piggy won't be poking his head out of these anytime soon so you won't have to worry about darning them.excellent pair of socks!
15949	"i have been wearing thorlo thick cushioned and reinforced running and sports socks since the late 60's. i first wore them for tennis, then racquetball for a total of 37 years. i'd buy six pair, then a dozen pair at a time, and mark them so that they got even wear. (originally, you could get thorlos with colored bands at the top - blue, red, grey, and plain.) in the last 5 years that i played - and played 6 days a week - any one pair of socks would last a month to 6 weeks maximum. it would not have been so bad, but they did not wear through where the reinforced heel was, but through the toe and at the ball of the foot. whether the problem with the ball of the foot was left or right, i don't know. both socks wore through in both places.i wrote to thorlo when i had ""stored up"" 30 pair of socks and, since i ordered direct for the last 10 years, they sent me three free pair. unfortunately, they had no reinforcement, and they ran within two weeks of wearing them. just catch them on a toe nail or part of the shoe, and they ran. comfortable, but they didn't last even when i just walked in them.my solution - when i was still playing racquetball - was to wear two pair at the same time. even then, some just had to be discarded when there were holes three inches around on the soles.last year, i switched to nikes at half the cost. i have had no trouble whatsoever with the nikes and though they're not as soft as thorlo, at least i'm getting my money's worth. (a little softener in the water does nicely.) i just got six pair for $16.65. so, while i'm sorry to report that thorlos are no longer what they used to be, i'm fairly confident that after 35+ years, i'm giving them a fair and accurate review."
15960	always buy comfortable socks, just make sure the size is right, am replacing older socks, these wear and wear. but no dyer if you want long life, hang to dry.
15978	well designed sock but thicker than i expected. great for cool weather workouts but feet got hot when weather got warm.
16064	this was a lovely product.  i have pashminas i actually acquired in turkey and this comes pretty close.  it is light weight, but very warm.  for the price - you can't do better.
16069	this is my everyday watch.  it is good looking, well-made (for the price) and durable thus far. only con is that it seems to gain couple seconds a day, therefore, at the end of the month, it is about minute or two fast -  i suppose it's better than  being slow but this is expected from a non-quartz movement type of watches that use unadjusted automatic movement.  it's a trade-off for not having the need to replace the battery every few years.  if you are like me and like to wear different watches for different occasions, auto-movement watches can be a pain unless you invest in auto-winder or two.i disagree with some people; i think invicta watches in general (i have several invictas) have decent bands that are nicely finished and have sufficient heft to them. compared to comparable seiko 5 automatic watches, seikos have cheap, light weight, rough feel to them, although the seiko 5 are also a good choice for a daily beater - their bands tend to give out long before their auto-movements do. these pro diver series that ape rolex/omega design are the ones that put invicta on the map in the watch world.although the style is easy to copy, customer service apparently is not as noted by many user here and other watch forums. but then, if i get several years of trouble-free use out them, i'm happy. if you want the legendary service, you gonna have to pony up for a real thing (rolex) through its authorized dealer.
16077	when it has came down to incita, they have been the highest demand for all kinds of watches. not just in price, but value and longevity in their timepieces. their automatic watches have been the highest of demand, not just in price, but value and longevity. definitely follows as well. their pro diver automatic watches are great not just in value, but in convience too. this blue-faced pro diver is definitely one of those watches that works brilliantly on the wrist it is a very easy to setup watch, but the big disadvantage is the unidirectional bezel which at times really can stick, and not rotate as briskly as other watches and their brands like bulova and citizen. i do like the shine on the piece, and has a great value. for anyone who wants a automatic watch for the people.price: bsetup & comfort: b-overall: b 1/2-
16133	we bought this for our first plane trip with car seat (infant carrier, chicco keyfit 30). it worked great, survived the plane trip well. for the infant seat, it was quite roomy. we stuffed other items in as well, since you can check a car seat for free. we didn't really try out the backpack straps on this trip, but i can imagine they would be helpful.
16162	even though i have a great respect for carhartt as a quality american manufacturer, i was dismayed by the fact that they were manufactured in mexico. at least they weren't made in china (my legs would have likely fallen off had they been). they shrunk one entire size in the first washing! fit great before that.
16168	i was just looking for a long-handled shoe horn and didn't realize the blade was mounted on a spring on this thing. i have no idea why anyone would think that's a good idea. the blade just flops around between foot and shoe and won't stay where it is needed.
16258	this is a think very warm shirt but it came a little small and then shrunk badly. still wearable as a work shirt.
16269	this belt looks to be just what i will need on my trip to italy in may 2012.  i can't review it any further at this time, but it seems to be a well made, and comfortable belt.  should be perfect for my trip. arrived in a timely fashion, as do most of my purchases at amazon.
16273	a good investment for travelling internationally where known pickpockets are a problem. a good safety measure.
16412	i really like my 'fierce' dance shoes. however please do take the other reviewers comments about sizing to heart. you really do have to order these 1 1/2 to two sizes larger than your normal street shoe size. they do in fact run that small.
16509	this that said i should have ordered a tall shirt.  i just feel that when i bend over it untucks my shirt and things start showing like my belly.  now my belly is not that big. but as i said it seems like i am always tucking the shirt in.  besides that it seems to be a very nice shirt.
16546	nice looking well fitting pants but they come out of the dryer wrinkled. i hate to iron. the material also has a slight plastic feel.
16603	the riggs workwear pants are very well made and will offer the user a long time of wear and comfort.the one item i can live with but was a bit disappointed in was the size.  i always buy my wrangler jeans in a 42 as after a wash or two they fit comfortably loose.  these riggs were a bit tight at the first try on.  i hope they do not shrink as they will become (for me) uncomfortably snug.
16611	these are a bit tight, but the sizing is almost right. they aren't uncomfortable, but also aren't the most comfortable i have worn. they look good, appear durable, etc. all in all i like these.
16711	fantastic, even better than pictured.  fits true to size, wife is 4' 10&#34; 34d and 104lbs and the small fits her perfect.  this is our favorite one purchased to date.
16810	this is a well-made, comfortable, not-too-heavy denim shirt, which i'll probably be using a lot for just hanging out, not just work.  i definitely plan to buy a few more of these shirts.  and, best of all, the sizing is right; too many shirts made overseas tend to be way too small for the labeled size.  these are right on the money, for a big guy like me.
16816	these have a nice, thick cotton fabric, and are very well put together. they are fairly loose fitting, as you would expect from a work shirt. they have a very soft and comfortable feel.the pocket is nice and sturdy, and has a small leather patch (about 1.2 x .6 inches) that furnishes a perfect place to clip in an ink pen. the front has two buttons, and the top one makes the neck quite snug. i usually leave that one unbuttoned, but in cold weather, it would be helpful.i got two, the forest green and oatmeal heather. i do a lot of airplane travelling, and these are perfect for that. they keep me warm on the flight (that air at 35,000 feet is always cold), and the pocket gives me a place for an mp3 player or whatever needs easy access in those narrow airplane seats. i also wear them as my daily knock-around shirts in fall thru winter. they're even nice enough for casual office settings.
16853	"these panties are very comfortable and fit well.  they have that ""barely there"" feeling.  i'm 7 months pregnant and bought these to wear during the last trimester and also post-partum.  my only issue is they are indeed thin, which makes them more comfortable, but i would like the crotch and stitching in the crotch area to be a little thicker."
16902	i'd recommend this bra it is very supportive and comfortable, however ugly. can't have it all i suppose, it'd take a genius to come up with something this supportive as well as eye appealing all in the same bra....
17004	inside of the boot there's a weird chunk of material that hurts when i walked just a couple steps in these boots. a shame because otherwise these seem like pretty great boots.
17013	i buy a new watch every month or so, so investing in a pin remover was a good idea.  however, the actual pin on the pin remover is weak material.  i broke my first one due to improper alignment.  granted, this was my 1st time and i didn't exactly know better.  i would gladly pay extra for stong steel or titanium pins. overall a good buy though for 15 bucks.
17035	did not work on my fossil kensington (the band was barely too big, but it did on my fossil avenger (which was already sized correctly).  this is not the correct tool for my g-shock.  i'm disappointed and would like to return it. i'll be looking for a more robust tool tonight.
17117	i looked everywhere locally for white pants  when i started volunteering at the local hospital.  no luck anywhere.  so i found and ordered these on amazon and was very happy that they were a bit baggy and long even though this is the size i always get for all pants.  they are more durable than painters pants but not as heavy as jeans. they were very comfortable at first until my wife washed them for the first time. the wash and dry methods was the same we use for my jeans and most other clothes.  they shrunk over 2.5 inches in length and 1 inch in width, even at the leg. i took pictures comparing a brand new second pair i have, but i can't post them on here on amazon. but trust me the visible shrinkage is astonishing. while they still barely fit, one more regular wash and dry and they would be done.  so i have to add these to the other cold wash and hang dry clothes i have.if you plan to use hot wash and dry method i strongly suggest you get at least one size bigger and wash them before the first wear.  other than the shrinking issue they fit the bill perfectly for white pants.
17140	i was hoping the fabric would be even more substantial. there is no hanging hook, you must have your own hangersinside to suspend the bag. there are no pockets for shoes or other items. it's just a bag. at this price it's an okay buy.if it lasts for decades as most of my luggage does, then itwill be a good buy. no big recommendation at this time
17147	i wear slippers around the house all year long so wanted these for the summer months.  i purchased a pair of acorn slippers at costco for almost half of what these cost.  they fit perfectly and are so comfortable.  i really wanted a pair in black because they do get dirty fast so purchased the black online.  they aren't the same slippers.  apparently i'm under the impression that costco is selling a less expensive version as the soles are made differently but are made just as well.  the top strap on these are heavily stitched around the front and they tend to dig into your skin.  they are quite uncomfortable.  i will wear them again but for now they are sitting in my closet.  i did go back to costco and they still had their version of this thong so purchased another pair in pink.. perfect.  i wish acorn would get it together and not sell one version at a cheaper price and then sell another version online for more money.  they aren't the same slippers.  please offer both alternatives acorn!!!
17148	these are the best slippers ever. i gave them to so many people for christmas. everyone loves them. they are very comfortable when you are on your feet a lot and they last a long time.
17211	this long-sleeve crew is high quality, warm, and feels soft to the skin. it is doing a great job keeping me warm this winter. you can also wear it to bed, and it works great as pajamas.
17227	and i hope that these work as described. i tried them on and the fit is fine and they feel comfortable. i will update this review when they become necessary as temperatures drop.update: well, the frankenstorm arrived and though there was only about a half inch of snow on this side of the state line, the temperatures dropped and have stayed on the chilly side since. the thermals worked perfectly and after one washing i am pleased. they shrunk ever so slightly that no doubt will relax with the next wearing. i didn't read the washing instructions until after they came out of the dryer but no problem  since i always wash with warm water(not hot). the next will be as directed. as a result of the experience.... five stars now.
17242	bought these for my husband. he wears them just fine because he isn't picky, but they are a bit harder soled than other shoes of similar style. they also run really big. i have ordered him a size 13 in every shoe i have bought over the last 17 years and never had to return a pair. returned the size 13 in these and ordered 12 instead. he mentioned that they still felt a little loose, but they were ok.
17349	my husband stole my first one on one of our walking trips through nyc.  (it was olive/taupe).  this is a great &#34;hands free&#34; bag to wheel the stroller, walk with a walker.  designed to avoid being pick-pocketed since the zipper is under your arm.  the internal and external pockets are abundant and you can be organized while still packing in a bottle of water and &#34;essentials&#34;, whatever your essentials may be!
17368	though it looks like you get a lot because of all the different color, but the most common elements, such as a white face base, are limited in quantity to such a degree that you need more stuff. many of the colors do not go on easily enough (to think) to put over other colors (like white base) without messing them up.
17389	"i love tank tops with built-in shelf bras and prefer them to regular bras most of the time.  i'm always looking for that ""perfect"" tank top - good price, good support, fairly easy to get on, decent ""coverage"" in the front, etc.this one isn't bad, but isn't my ideal.  i bought a small and found that it is a decent fit once it is on, but can be difficult to get into - kind of like shrugging my way into a rubber band.  the support level in the chest area is a little more ""bouncy"" than i'd prefer, and overall the fabric isn't quite thick enough to prevent show-through if it is worn on its own.  the style of the straps lends itself more to ""undergarment"" status anyway, and it isn't bad as that - something to wear under a sweater in the wintertime.another reviewer mentioned that the big pink logo was a problem, and i agree.  if i buy a black tank top i want it to be all black - i don't really care to have a logo, especially not a pink one.the biggest downer is the price - $22 seems a bit too much to pay for this top, when i have found other tops i like better for less on amazon.  i'm definitely keeping the one i bought, but i don't think i'll buy any more."
17411	i bought these as a gift. they were very well received and the style is exactly the one he prefers most from levis.
17514	we just got back from an alaskan cruise and i used these shoes a lot on board. i took them because they did not take up a lot of room and thought they would be good to use just to walk around ship.  boy, was i ever right about them. and they looked good with my dressy pants or my jeans.  i highly recommend them and suggest you buy them through amazon because i paid about a 1/3 of their retail price here.
17523	i have been looking for so long for a pair of plain ballet shoes for my wedding. though the color is slightly darker (not noticeable) than my ivory dress, they are what i've been looking for. all other shoes had some ornate item on them which i didn't like, love this
17547	my son is performing outdoor work in the mountains in france so i purchased polypropylene items to keep him warm.  this was a great price and does the job keeping the ears and neck warm without the fuss and workplace dangers of scarves, earmuffs etc.  i don't know about static electricity.  i have long hair and seldom wear hats scarves due to the static, however, my son wears his hair military short, so it is not a problem.  highly recommended!
17629	the shoes is very good. ligth, soft and the color black is very good. i recomended. i like the finished in leather.
17633	i have worn this shoe exclusively for playing tennis over the past 20 years.i was a bit surprised to find reebok no longer has a toe guard on this model.  it has the same upper and the same hard court ripple pattern with a wear guard for the ball of the foot, but no toe guard to wear out (rather than the inner side of the shoe) while dragging your rear foot forward before launching the serve!i'm a bit disappointed because that is the area i typically wear out first or at the same rate as the ball of the foot wear guard.
17644	my third pair of this exact model and make. excellent quality, consistent through the years and best price/value ratio i have found in a long time.
17682	these were not the usual glove leather that i am used to in the reebok  princess sneakers . these are more like counterfeit knock off in a reebok box . the material was hard , stiff ,man made  and cheap man made. the shoes that listed as wide were not even a medium. the price was comparable to market value but not quality . i bought a pair fory mom and me and they both went back . i won't be buying from this vender ever again. however i had no problem getting a return label or my money refunded. the star is for their customer service. the shoes get nothing.
17731	i have been wearing the princess sneaker for years now and have them in white also....they are the only shoe i can put on new and never have a problem with them.  true to size and width.  i have back problems and these are the only shoes i can wear and walk comfortably...great product......
17788	i bought it as a gift for my relative and he was very pleased with it.  i think it looks very classy and elegant.
17807	i'm going to give this as a gift so i hope it works as good as it looks but for the money can't really complain.
17825	multi-functional, rugged, accurate and decent looking to boot. i found the strap to be a little on the short side for myself. i use the next to the last hole. while the watch case itself is large the acutal dial face is a tad on the small side. the minute hand is a tad too long and the hour hand is a tad too short. the illumination is only for the digital window which is usually set for month/day mode so telling time at night is difficult. small little things that are not show stoppers, this watch comes from a proud heritage of g-shock development which places this timepiece in the winners circle. i expect to get many years of rugged service from this watch.
17878	these socks are excellent for a wide variety of physical fittness activities.  they provide comfort and care as an individaul works out.  the are long lasting and good looking and a great value for the price.  this product is always of fine quality.
17894	ok sock, does produce the most lint i've ever seen in a sock. scared myself the first time i took them off. they do fit pretty good and are a very warm sock. have probably washed them 20 times now and am just getting a little lint at this point. will try another sock before buying these again but they are not terrible.
17934	these fit great and are very comfortable.  they seem to be holding up very well.  i think they are well worth the price.
17995	this is my second pair and i hope they are never discontinued.  along with being stylish they are very convenient to slip on and off but still fit as well as any 'tie' sneaker.
18066	this is obviously a quality product.  but the space for your foot looks almost like an after-thought.  like so much work went into the lower design that they forgot what body part this goes on.i got a full size larger than i normally wear, both in length and width, because my feet sweat a lot and i want to wear a couple of socks.  no room.  as it is, i will have to wear a pair of thin socks to get these to on.  not what i hoped for.
18076	"i have a terrible time finding bras to fit. even most 34aa bras gap in the cup on me. i'm 5'11"" and have wideset breasts with a wide root, so finding a bra that is spaced out enough and has a wire that fits around the entire root of my breasts is not an easy task, especially since my breasts don't have much volume. i usually just buy bras and then completely alter them to fit better.i ordered the timpa duet lace underwire demi bra in beige in a 34a. my underbust is 28.5 inches and the band on the last clasp feels nice and snug. it doesn't feel tight or uncomfortable, just like it is supporting me. the straps are actually long enough too, i don't even have them lengthened all the way. the underwire might be a tiny bit too narrow for me, but i am bending it some which has widened it.my breast tissue actually fills out the cups! in fact, i could have gone up to a 34b. i really didn't feel like paying to send the bra back in the mail though. i also think the cups may give a little over time. i plan on ordering more of these bras in the future though, and when i do i will get the 34b."
18138	i bought the mary jane sketchers to use as work shoes. every time i walk, move my foot or ankle the leather on the top of the shoe makes noise/squeaks. i work in a quiet environment and the noise is very annoying. i'm hoping the leather softens up in time, cause it's driving me nuts! i do like the adjustable straps that cross over the top of the shoe and it does run true to size. the shoe is stylish but are not as comfortable as other sketcher styles. all in all i like the shoe, however i don't think it's really suitable for what i originally intended to use them for.
18159	i actually found these quite uncomfortable.  which is weird since i pretty much have like a million different pair of skechers.  this company selling them is not amazon so be careful.  i haven't been able to have any communication with them.  i really suggest buying them directly from skechers which has them at $50 (less than i paid for them).  you'll be really sorry if you have to make any returns so just wanted to give a warning!
18198	"the soles are durable for going outside and they do keep you warm.  but, now that they have gone up to $40 they are not worth the price given the sheepskin lining is not attached to the bottom of the shoe very well and starts coming off after about 4 weeks of use.  leaving you with patches of sheepskin on the bottom and parts where it's just the bare ""plastic?"" bottom.  the sheepskin does stay on the cuff portion."
18241	the slippers by tamarac are very nice looking and comfortable (as long as you buy a size or two bigger than you normally wear--and for a short while, anyway). the lining is not genuine sheep skin. it is some crappy synthetic fiber that rolls into little balls and/or tubes and, after a month or so of wearing, it will rapidly disappear--resulting in very cold and unhappy feet. i will never buy this product again.
18339	the good news...these slippers look and fit great!  and they actually feel great -- keep my feet nice and warm, not to  hot or cold -- until i actually stood and walked in them.  the bad news...wtf!!!!...the feel on the sole of my heel is like something is protruding up from the slipper's heel/sole...both left and right slipper.how could this be???  i literally thought there was some kind of foreign object lodged in the slippers.  not so...just feels like there is.  is this a manufacturing defect, or could these slippers actually be designed to be this uncomfortable...and painful!i really wanted to keep these slippers.  like i said they look and feel great as long as you never have to stand or walk in them.  sending them back tomorrow.....what a disappointment!!!!
18372	i bought these slippers for my husband the end of october 2012 and in 2 1/2 months they are totally worn out. the sole on the right foot cracked and split  and the seams along the top part of the foot on both both feet have broken away from the sole! i am very disappointed as i thought these sheepskin slippers would be durable. i would never recommend this brand again!
18388	the sizes run small and fit very tight. if you want to wear socks with them, then you need to orders at least 1 or more sizes larger then you wear.
18392	needed a new pair of slippers and ordered these on previous reviews. i am very satisfied with this purchase. the slippers are very warm and look very durable. they only had the root beer color in stock but will watch for the lighter color in the future...
18454	"this series of diadora soccer bags comes in a variety of colors and 3 sizes.  i own the forest green/black bag in the small size.this bag contains the following compartments:* one large inner compartment.  the compartment includes a plastic-covered ""floorboard"" to give the bag some structure.  some bags do not include this part, which makes a bag more difficult to carry.* one small zippered pocket on one end.  the pocket is somewhat small and is vented.* one ball net on the other end.  the net is a ""bungie"" type and will fit a size 5 ball or smaller.  it could also be used for wet clothing, etc.obviously you could use the bag for several sports, although with the ball net, its intended use is to carry soccer accessories. the bag appears to be well made and is constructed of decent nylon/pvc.  the shoulder strap has a padded middle for resting on your shoulder and the strap is adjustable to various lengths.  the overall size is approximately 17"" long, and the bag's height and width is about 11"" each.  if you plan to keep a ball in the net, add another 10"" or so to the length.this product is best suited for a soccer player who needs to bring his uniform and accessories to school and the field.  this bag will fit in a typical full length locker.  it will not fit in some half length lockers unless you empty some contents and fold the bag a little.here's what i was able to put in it and my son was able to easily fit it in his school locker....fully loaded (and in need of a slight shove to get in the locker):in the main compartment, i put:* one pair of cleats, men's size 8 1/2* two uniforms (home and away jerseys and two pairs of shorts)* two pairs of shin guards* two pairs of socks* one pair of slider shorts with cup.* four water bottles, approximately 1 liter each.in the outside pocket:* a hand towel.  it won't hold much more.in the ball net:* a size 5 ball.all of these items fit easily with plenty of room to spare.  being that my son's locker, like most school lockers, is fairly narrow, he had to give the bag a slight shove to get it in the locker.this bag comes in two larger sizes, however if you do need to put it in a locker, anything bigger than this one could be a nuisance to fit.because the interior compartment has no dividers, please consider that you have no place to keep dry/wet, clean/dirty items seperated.  that is where the net can help, or you may want to throw a couble of plastic bags in the bag. also, the floorboard, although covered in a heavy plastic, is cardboard so eventually it will soften.  i don't consider these major flaws, given the price of the bag.  in fact, my bag has lasted through much use for over two years, and at onbe point i cut the endge of teh removable floorboard piece witha  razor, pulled out the cardboard and inserted a piece of plastic to make the bag even stronger.  or, ofr the price you may want to just buy another bag after a couple of years.this bag is a good value, especially considering it is very inexpensive.  it appears to be able to perform as well as, if not better, than other bags i have from other makers."
18508	i ordered two--one in black and one in ivory--and i'm pleased with them. there are shoulder-pads, which are ridiculous, given that the pads fall far past my actual shoulders (and my shoulders are narrow, but not *that* narrow), but taking those out won't destroy the robes. the belt-loops are definitely high, so that throws off the shape a little, and if you're naturally very low-waisted i wouldn't recommend them, but the robes themselves are nicely-made, soft, and pretty. if you're looking for a good robe for a good price, this is a very attractive option. (eta: when i bought these, they were $15 apiece. for 30, i might still buy them, but i'd have a look around first.)
18531	pretty decent, very thin nylon and overall looks pretty much like it does in the ad photo.  except the hood isn't attached to the top. it has tiny velcro that is suppose to hold but doesnt really stay on his heaad.  the other peices are fine, so its ok for his a kid's dress up. my five year old took a size medium and he's a size 6.
18535	"it's a fine watch, but don't rely too much on the ""water resistant"" label.  i've had similar timex watches that had no trouble with leakage from being worn while swimming or kayaking.  but as chance would have it, i got one that leaked (badly) from being worn in the water.  (no button pushes under water or any other action that would have increased chance of leakage; it just leaked.)too late to return to amazon, and timex warranty coverage for this sort of thing isn't clear.  (besides, shipping both ways would probably come up to half the cost of replacing with a new watch.)too bad, it's otherwise a watch with a great feature set, maintains accuracy reasonably well, etc."
18559	i had a watch like this for about 30 years before it died. well, actually it didn't completely die, the band came apart and the light quit working, so i got a new one.  keeps perfect time.  for the price you can't beat it.  i've had two much more expensive, dressy seiko watches and they aren't nearly as reliable.
18561	didnt like it very much but i think its ok. doesnt look durable to me but hope im proven wrong durning ussage.
18604	i purchased this watch for general use.  with the stretch band, it is easy to put on, but after a few hours, it tends to pinch.  i also like the fact that you can depresss the dial and it will illuminates in the dark.
18605	just received this watch today from amazon and let me say that i am very picky about watches and bought this watch for 2 reasons:bought this because timex watch is my favorite brand, and it lasts and lasts! i am going from past experiences both windup timex watches and also quartz timex watches. i still have a 1985 quartz that is still going, no light in this one this is why i bought this watch and also because it is an easy reader! i would have given this watch 5 stars but did not because of the watchband problem, please read on in the cons and you will see why...also, did not want to see someone else go through the time and expense that i did, it cost me $5 to have the watchband cut and adjusted and even so it is still not a comfortable watchband due to width, so i ended up buying a leather watchband at $9 so it cost me more money and trouble due to the wide width of this watchband that pinches! (i have always found that leather watchbands are easier to adjust, look smart and are so much more comfortable).pros:1) easy reader feature--this watch is very easy to read yet it is small enough to be feminine as i am girly girly!2) great simple design, just right for any occasion from everyday to dressy watch!3) best of all, the light as i need to see the time at night and in dimly lit areas.4) second hand, great feature5) water-resistant, however, i will take it off when i shower just to be on the safe side after reading the other reviews.cons:1) i could only find one con. this watch will only accept a leather band (if you choose to replace the band). i went to a jeweler and had him try to place a very nice metal band that should have fit this watch, it did not because it has to be rounded at the top to fix. *note that the older timex watches, you could replace the band with a metal band or a leather band. ****however, i did have the same jeweler take out some lengths out of the band that came with the watch and it fits ok, however because of the width of the band it pinches and is not comfortable. so at the same time, i bought a leather replacement band and probably have this one put on this watch as i find a leather band is much more comfortable and easy to adjust because i have such small wrists! would i buy this watch again? yes for 2 reasons: the light feature and the easy reader feature, for those reasons, and i will enjoy this watch with my new black leather watchband!
18616	the wrist band pinches and i can't find a source to order additional links or just buy a longer wrist band.  i can't wear it and it sits on my computer desk.  need some assistance, please.
18621	this is a great watch. i wanted an expansion band because i have occasion to take my watch off and put it on several times a day. after reading one of the reviews, i hoped it did not have a &#34;pinchy&#34; feel to it. maybe it was made expressly for my wrist, i hardly know i'm wearing it. very comfortable and always in the right place when i need to look at it, no sliding around. the design is perfect. i can wear it for dressy or with jeans. it is indeed easy to read, except for the tiny little date window. it is just what i was looking for. accurate and nice looking. i am very happy with it. i highly recommend it.
18663	i love my easy reader timex. the lighted face at the push of a button is so handy. the watch keeps perfect time too. it is comfortable to wear, i never take it off. it is water resistant, so taking a shower, doing  dishes etc doesn't ruin it. this is the third timex easy reader watch i have had. they last several years for me, but then the battery needs to be replaced. at that point i just get a new watch. but if one is so inclined to replace the battery, the watch continues working well. i have had the battery replaced in one but found that the battery and service fee to replace it were as much as a new watch. i am not handy enough to be able to replace the batteries myself. for a wonderful watch with back light, a second hand, a date keeper where the number three on the dial is, a face that i can see, i am totally satisfied. and i will continues to purchase this variety of timex.
18671	i bought this watch to take on vacation to have an affordable watch for the beach. i got this for not only a great price, but the design really looks great on my wife's wrist. she tends to like to have a watch to keep track of time rather than carrying her phone around the beach. the watch has stood up great to sand and being tossed around in her bag.great quality, i highly recommend this watch for anyone looking for a tropical beach style watch and requires the underwater feature.
18676	when the light goes on  you have to hold it sideways to see the numbers. though my daughter just likes the way it looks and isn't concerned with the extra features.nice watch.
18868	gave these to my son a year ago last october.  he has worn them to the job site everyday since then and was happy that they didn't really need a breaking in period straight out of the box. he is trying to decide if he wants to get another pair of these or take his boss up on getting a pair of red wings.
18879	i ordered this in a wide, and it's still too tight around my the ball of my foot.  i wear either medium or wide widths (my foot's not super wide).  glad i didn't try the medium width as i wouldn't have been able to fit my foot in.  if you have a narrow foot, these shoes would be great.  however, i returned!
18894	these boots looked just about perfect in the pictures. i was especially glad to see a 2 inch heel and trendy buckles on the side. in reality, however, they are clunky and look cheaply made. the style is more cowboy than i expected, with the leather bunching up around the ankle a bit. back they went.
18903	very nice ironman,the screen is much bigger, and the digits are easier read, straight on or at an angel.  also the start/split center/bottom button is easier to press on the fly...er..i mean run..hahathe amount of memory you get along with splits is more than the previous generation.also, you get more options with alarms.  daily, weekend only, week only, or just individual days, nice!  but, i find myself only changing the time on the daily select....like every other watch does.
18907	this is an ok watch.  the battery lasted for years.  but when the battery wears out, you can not replace it yourself.  they have the watch rigged so you need special tools and expertise to replace it.  sorry, but that's a jerk thing to do, imho.
19016	"young people have no idea what they're missing (their loss is actually ours, since they're not aware of it).  not only have lp's and cd's gone out of style (replaced by downloaded mp3 files) but watches as well (replaced by the digital read-outs on cellular phones and ipods).  i'm sorry, but the only thing that keeps me functional in our overly-digitized, gadget-driven world is a plain-old, plain-spoken, fashion-resistant watch like this timex with a bland analog face that even a mother wouldn't love--only a great grandmother or someone with as long a memory as mine.but this piece is redolent with its own memories--of the special telecasts of all-star live jazz spectaculars sponsored by timex and hosted by former newsman, john cameron swaze.  amid the flurries of fringe-reception snow, you might catch momentary sight of benny or louis or ella and even hear a few notes of ""perdido"" or ""when the saints come marching in.""  but most memorable of all were the commercials: timex watches being subjected in ""real time"" to fire and ice, poundings and shakings, high-dives into pools of water, followed by swayze's invariably reassuring and authoritative commentary on the outcome: ""the watch that takes a licking and keeps on ticking.""hate to admit that none of my timexes purchased in the '50's are still ticking, but this one, which boasts a ""ten-year battery,"" is thus far showing promise of a good, strong heart.  and unlike the '50's version, this new and improved (can that be possible?) timex lends extra support to those of us who have lost all but our long-term memories: it even offers a reminder of the date and day of the week as well as hands that light up without the radium coating.  best of all, it's no less affordable than its 1950's counterpart.  if anything, it's kept behind the pace of inflation! (thank you, china, for making possible the continuance of an american tradition)."
19028	i was looking for a cool watch for camping and that it was good looking.pros:1. gives a military look with 24hrs look and it glows in dark.cons:1. not waterproof2. plastic material, the strap is not very resistant3.  they are much better watches at this price is more like a 10$ watch top.buy another watch  i get dissapointed at this watch
19146	"i read the majority of the reviews. i was apprehensive when i read that they were ""arrowhead shaped"". they are, but they are not ""totaly"" flat (front to back) they are not a full tear drop either. see the pendant that matches and you will get a better picture of what the earring shape is. i would describe it as a ""pillowed out"" arrowhead shape.if you like blue and you are picking these out because of the picture, don't. find some that say they are blue. these do reflect a sparkle of all colors with the majority colors of amber and yellow at the center of the earring, because of the reflection off of your skin and the indoor lighting. outside they reflect all colors. they are great daily ware earrings. they go with everything and aren't too fancy for jeans. they are very eye catching but not ""too fancy"" and they are not tiny or too big. the size in the ladies photo is acurrate to where the earring will fall from the ear.for the shape see this productsterling silver multi faceted swarovski crystal pendant"
19182	i love this chain!  it is 30&#34; long and perfect for my heart charm that i put on it.  the price was good and so was the shipping.  it is easy to open and close.  i would recommend this chain.
19183	i have moderate metal allergies, and had a reaction to a &#34;sterling silver&#34; chain that was given to me. i wanted a delicate chain for my silver pendant that would not cause my skin to breakout, and this was a good contestant to the price. having done some research on jewelry chains, i found that the wheat and box chains are the most durable chains for their size, and this one fit the bill (delicate and not too flashy, strong so i don't lose my pendant).the chain arrived quickly, and i was amazed at its high quality and how sparkly it is. it's very pretty and shiny, but not too bling-y due to its thin diameter, and complemented my pendant perfectly. best of all, i wore it for a few days in a row, one of which my neck got slightly sweaty from bicycling, and it did not irritate my skin. would definitely buy again from this seller if i need another silver chain.
19229	title pretty much sums it up.  like everyone else has mentioned.. this head cover is on the small size.  i took a chance 'cause my hat size is small (make it up in my shoe size, if you know what i mean...)it was right for the price!
19242	it's hard to buy a bandanna these days, as they tend to be crappy.  this was takes a few washings to soften up, like most of them do, but end up soft and don't bleed in the process.  not the highest quality, but not a piece of junk either.  i use it around my neck when i ride my motorcycle, and it's great for that.  a bit small for around my head, but i also have a head the size of a zeppelin.
19298	on the advice of my husband's podiatrist, we bought two pair of these low-cut targhee shoes. perfect for my husband's very flat feet. they're stable, roomy, accommodating enough for his orthotics, and comfortable for all day use. no other shoe has offered him the support this shoe has. achy feet--gone!additionally, they're well made and good looking. i see another pair in his future.
19306	great bra. the only issue i have is the elastic around the top and bottom &#34;bite&#34; a little. i solved the issue with an extension. next one, i will order a size larger.
19322	i like this bra it did everything i wanted but for a 36 it felt like a 34 but once on its good and supports well. but is tight. and pushes up.
19329	absolutely no arch support, hard inflexible soles, and no footbed cushioning whatsoever. i feel guilty for not being able to wear these, as they were a gift from a loved one, but they are just too uncomfortable to bear.
19384	i love uggs. i have the brown ones and decided to get another pair in grey. they are comfy to walk in and mold around your feet. i wear a 6.5-7 and ordered a 6. fits great!
19461	these are nice socks, but to me....overpriced. i think i could find socks that were just as nice for a lot less money. i would not purchase them again for that reason alone.
19490	been wearing this hat for a couple months now. seems to be made well, no loose threads or holes yet. hard to beat for the price.
19504	for the price i cant beat these. been wearing them every day for 12+ hours for almost 2 months. i used mink oil to condition them and they look great. very comfortable, would buy again. lets see how long they last.
19507	i purchased these for my husband after he blew the heel off his other pair.he told me they broke in really nice over a weekend hiking trip. they are probably the most comfortable shoe he owns as he now wears them just to hit lowe's! he waded through a bit of water and his feet stayed nice and dry. highly recommended!
19552	this is the perfect weight and the medium was a good fit for me as a woman who wears a 12-14.  i look forward to wearing it!  the navy blue is a nice dark blue shade also.  i like that fact that it packs into the front pocket.
19558	i was in costa rica in the middle of the rainforest when it was down pouring for an hour straight. i only got damp in the pocket area but the rest of me was completely dry! lightweight and comfortable. it was perfect for the hot damp rainy weather. fast shipping too!
19580	the green in these is so pretty! very eye catching!  the lever back is my favorite!  gorgeous!
19593	this ring is awesome.  it is very pretty and the diamonds looke real.  i have gotten compliments on the ring.
19625	it's finally time to replace my old timberland light hiker that i've had for over 20 years.  yes, about 20 years of solid performance!  i received this new one yesterday with high expectation.  from the initial fitting, it feels just like my old one, no need to break in whatsoever.  super comfortable and an even better fit that it's available in 2e.  all i can hope for is for this light hiker to last just as long.this is a light trail boot, casual everyday wear that will provide comfort and good looks.  for more serious hike/terrain, i'd recommend something from lowa.  for hunters, i'd recommend irish setters/red wings.this timberland boot is great value!
19642	i wear my boots for outdoor work.  the boot has been very comfortable right from the start.  the soles have good grip on dry grasses ... a substrate with the slickness of teflon on the wrong sole.  i suspect that the first thing to give out will be the laces; the bungee kind of loose thread. otherwise, i find these boots to be of fair value for the price.
19690	keeping with the carhartt name these bib overalls are well constructed and worth every penny paid. i bought a size larger then normal and they fit perfectly with or without a pair of jeans beneath them. i also like the moss color so much better then the normal brown. you might spend a little more for these but as i said they are worth every penny and the material is so much better then anything cheaper.
19712	i wanted a pair of basic houseshoes that were washable and had a hard sole that could be worn outside.  i have cats, so i needed something that didn't attract cat hair.  i was not having any luck at the stores as their shoes were too fancy - focusing more on look than on versatility.  these shoes fit the bill.  what i didn't expect was how comfortable they were. the padding on the inside sole is amazing.  there is just a bit of arch support, but it easily conforms to the shape of your foot.  the top part is also soft and cushy.  the size runs true.  the fabric is t-shirt material-like and is very attractive.  not fancy looking but a very nice, durable houseshoe.  i purchased the grey ones.
19749	i needed slippers because i have fibromyalgia and spend most days indoors. although i have bought isotoner slippers within the past year and knew they would wear out within a month, i bought these anyway. during the first week they fit snug and with each passing day spread out more and more.now after wearing daily, and i do not walk around alot, they are uncomfortable with lumps inside instead of a cushion they started out with. will have to save my pennies to buy a quality pair of slippers but honestly don't think i should have to pay $50.00 for slippers. oh isotoner or whoever you are owned by now - what have you done?p.s.  folks - same thing happened with the dearfoam slippers i bought. poor quality from those too. my slipper quest continues!
19834	just feels funny on as though it's going to fall off at any moment although i must say it does the job
19956	theses slippers are warm and comfy. surprisingly, it took a while to break into them. at first they felt a bit awkward. the base is a bit narrow, which caused my feet to roll. i was tempted to send them back, but after a while i stopped noticing the rolling. now they feel a big fluffy wool sock, which is great.my only qualm is the sizing. i where a size 11 but i found the 10.5m - 11.5m to be very big. my feet have about an inch and half to spare. it's not a big deal though. it's not like i go for long walks in them.
19959	this slipper fits like a glove and is extremely comfortable.  not only is it my &#34;go to&#34; slipper at home, but i even take it with me and  change into it on transatlantic flights.
19983	this visor has a nice large brim and is pretty comfortable to wear.  the weave is not as tight as i would have hoped and it does allow some sun through in between the weaving.  i use it while walking in the late afternoon so it's okay for that but i would hesitate to depend on it to protect my face during the noon time sun.
20049	the other reviews were right--docs are not as comfortable as they were back when i wore them in high school. the leather looks cheaper, and it's taking longer to break them in.
20074	i was soooo excited to get my docs but when i put them on, this uk 7 was not the same as my old uk 7 from over 10 years ago.  they fit more like what i would consider a uk 6.5, even though there is no such thing.  i can only figure that this is because these are made in china and not england like my originals.  i got the pink tartan, and while i do like them they look a bit like wellies (rain boots).  they are really really stiff, whereas my old docs did not have any break-in period.  i have yet to decide if i am keeping them, because i fear the uk 8 will be too big.  just for reference, i am a women's 9.5-10 (us men's 8) and a solid 41 euro size.  i wish these were more like a standard euro 41 than a bit smaller than that.
20119	.yes, i've had this boot for several years and it's ooh sooo warm on those frigid winter hunts.  i keep a pair in my car throughout the winter in case of a break-down.  that provides some peace-of-mind of long trips on compact snow and ice here in the inland northwest.the boots run a little large, but i expect that is to accommodate heavy wool socks or two pair of socks.  the insert is easily extracted for drying or cleaning, and the leather strap on the upper back portion of the boot helps to get the boot on.  these are an absolute necessity in cold climates.
20145	used to repair some fancy boots with a soft heel. very happy to get some more life out of almost new shoes.  (also used it to rebuild a rubber radiator mount for my minivan that wasn't available anymore!)
20156	"there is a large family of goop adhesives, ""all purpose"", ""automotive"", ""craft"", ""household"", ""lawn and garden"", ""marine"", ""plumbing"", ""rv"", ""sport and outdoor"", and ""wood and furniture""  as far as i can tell, all are identical.  so, i suggest buying the cheapest.  in the local hardware store, ""household goop"" is usually the cheapest.  at the time of this writing, ""plumbing goop"" is the cheapest on amazon.  caveat, there is a black version of ""shoe goop"".shoes and other leatheruse fresh ""thin"" goop.  apply a thin layer.  if you are trying to glue a large surface, such as all or most of a sole, it is best two apply goop to both surfaces---but as thin as possible.  a wooden ""popsicle stick"" may be useful to spread the goop. in most cases you need to clamp the layers together.  there are a wide variety of clamps available for woodworking which may be helpful in specific situations.  if you happen to have a solid-wooden shoe stretcher, it may be helpful in clamping.  as with woodworking, firm clamping is important, but clamping too hard causes problems.  in some cases, you may be able to get by with clothespins and heavy rubber bands or blue painters tape.  in anycase, it is essential to let the glue cure for at least three days before using the shoes.  i recommend waiting a week.  i've used goop to repair leather watch bands and belts.in generalgoop will bond virtually any material, including leather, plastics, glass, and metal.  the bond is clear, very strong, waterproof, and hard but flexible.other usesexamples are endless.  in addition to the examples below, i've used it to repair ceramic plant pots and shoes.  i also use it to seal rust spots on my dishwasher rack.  the goop it also makes a ""cushioned"" surface that will prevent scratches to dishes.  i use goop to close small holes in window screens.  i've used goop to seal holes in air-mattresses.electricalgoop is far superior to electrical tape for splicing wires, re-insulating cat-chewed wires, waterproofing and vibration-proofing electrical connections.  there is a black variety of ""shoe goop"" if you want your repair to be less noticeable.plumbinggoop is great for sealing small leaks (including garden hose connections, etc.).  however, you have to turn off the water, and the connections must be absolutely dry.  moreover, it takes several days for goop to dry to reasonable strength.  if you turn on the pressure before then you will make a water balloon.  it's better to wait a week.  moreover, it may take several applications to get a thick enough layer of goop to hold against normal household pressure--so a sink, toilet, etc. may be out-of-commission for at least three days waiting for the goop to dry.shortcomings1) an opened tube thickens quickly.  store open tubes in a small glass jar with a tight metal lid.  old thick goop does not work well for some uses (such as repairing shoes), but is perfect when you need a thick application--such as insulating an exposed electrical connection or to hold pressure in a leaking water line.  it is best to start with a thin layer from a new tube to maximally bond to the surface2) until it dries, goop flows, alot.  therefore a thickly-applied layer may dry to a very thin layer (because most of the glue has flowed somewhere else).  so, it may be essential to apply several thin layers (at intervals of 4 hours or longer) rather than one thick layer.  alternatively, you can apply a thicker layer of old thick goop over an initial layer of new goop.  if possible, arrange the pieces you are gluing to minimize flowing, i.e., usually horizontal.  for several hours, depending on the temperature etc., the glue is ""repositionable"" after thickening a little, that is, you can push it back into place.  unfortunately, if you use too many layers or ""reposition"" the glue too much, the result is not as attractive.3) except when still tacky (when it can be removed with naptha or acetone), goop is essentially non-cleanup-able.  so, for example, while it might be terrific for fixing a leaking windshield, if you mess up and your application is ugly, there is essentially nothing you can do about it.  although goop is terrific for repairing a broken ceramic statuette--if a little extra oozes out, there is no way to clean it up the excess.  you could simply peel/rub-off excess silicon glue.  you could simply wipe off ""white glue"" and clean up with a moist paper towel.4) the fumes are strong and toxic.  allow glued items to dry in a well-ventilated area (ideally out-of-door) for several days.  when doing alot of gluing, i work in my carport with a large utility fan blowing the fumes away---and still usually get a nasty headache.  it is best to use gloves when working with goop.to goop or not to goopwhile goop is truly miraculous--there are situations when other types of glue are better choices.white glue:  for most light-duty indoor household applications which do not have to be waterproof, ordinary household white glue is much safer, cleanup is much easier, and in most cases repairs are redo-able if you make a mistake.  for example:elmer's all multipurpose white glue, 7 5/8 oz. (e379)wood glue:  carpenters's wood glue is essentially water-proof (when dry) white household glue.  it is much better than goop for most wood repairs.  it penetrates and strengthens the wood.  it is much safer, and cleanup is much easier.  if the joint breaks again (because the wood is weak), it can be re-glued.  for example:elmer's e701 carpenter's wood glue 8-ouncesilicon glue:  silicon glue is best for glass, and when you want a truly flexible connection (for example, to absorb vibrations).  it is a better choice for general household use on glass, plastic, and metal when you do not need the maximum possible strength.  it is safer than goop, and cleanup is easier.  like goop, silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength, weeks to reach maximum strength.  for example:ge silicone ii household glue, 2.8 ozepoxy:  when you need a strong rigid workable (e.g. sandable surface) adhesive, particularly for use on metal or hard plastic, epoxy is a muchbetter choice.  for joining metal ""j&b; weld"" epoxy is best.  most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage, and so are good for filling gaps.  fiberglass epoxy is best for joining/filling hard plastic.  epoxies are safer than goop, and cure much quicker.  the major drawback to epoxies is that they consist of two parts (resin and hardener) which must be mixed in small batches, and then applied with your own applicator (e.g., a toothpick).  some are packaged in a dual-syringe---but that is not an adequate solution, because the components must still be manually mixed in order harden to maximum strength.  previously, a major drawback was that all epoxies were colored (usually white)---but now clear epoxies are available.  for example:j-b weld 8265-s cold weldclearbond h-3s clear strong epoxy adhesive syringe - .85ozsuper-glue (krazy glue):  super-glue is very strong, rigid, and fast.  in many ways it is similar to 2-minute epoxy---except that no mixing is required.  although very hard, super-glue is brittle, and so, is not recommended for flexible objects.  super-glue is hazardous in that it can easily glue fingers (etc.) together.  previously, i used super-glue frequently on objects (e.g., jewelry) when a clear bond was required---however, goop is better for such applications, and clear epoxies have become available.  opened super-glue keeps poorly, even in tighly sealed glass containers---so i recommended packages of multiple very small tubes.bazic super glue, 3 grams 0.10 ounces, 6 per packkrazy glue kg92548r instant krazy glue all purpose brush 0.18-ounceapplicator tipif you use the applicator tip, and do not use the entire tube at one time, much unused glue remains in the tip, which is wasted and clogs up the tip.  if you plan to use the glue again within about a week, then jam an old unused (uncut) applicator tip over the one on the tube, and store in a small glass jar with a tight lid.  if you aren't likely to do more gluing within two weeks, remove the tip and put the cap back on (and store the tube in a small jar with a tight lid)  if it is necessary to clean out an applicator tip, then take it off the tube, let the glue dry for several days, then pull it out with tweezers.conclusiongoop is one of those ""miracle"" products with a thousands uses, which needs to be a permanent part of any household.  other such items include silicon greasepermatex 22058 dielectric tune-up grease - 3 oz.painter's tapescotchblue painter's tape 2090-1e2, 1 inch by 60 yards, 1 roll, and wd-40.  wd-40 spray lubricant - 16-oz."
20160	ordered these for my daughter for christmas....she loves them!  we have never been let down by sorel; top quality, true to size boot.
20202	worked great when working out. i did squats going below parallel and they did not rip. i have bought more than one.
20277	high quality and inexpensive. excellent tote bag. i keep one in my car for those times i drop in at the food mart that is so organic they don't offer bags.
20280	i ordered 6 of these bags for my bridesmaids.  even though they shipped together in the same box, each one was charged $4 in shipping.  so while the bag was only $4, it was a total of $8 per bag.  i didn't think that was a bad price until i received the bags and felt how cheap they are.  very thin.  will work for a beach bag and i am not returning them since they are gifts, but i would not buy more unless they get the shipping down to an acceptable level.  $8 for this bag is wayyyy too much for the quality delivered.
20288	i love this tote bag.  its used for my everyday commute.  its very strong and i love the fact that it's washable.  i can fit my lunch, cosmetic bag and a pair of office shoes - it also has two smal compartments for keys, cell phone, etc.  - it doesn't fasten at the top -but that's not an issue with me.
20321	i have several of these and they are very durable.  this one is tiny and very cute.  i would buy in every color!
20333	"i really like my gildan shirts.  i got light blue and a pink one later, and neither was  more intense than shown....altho it was a while ago, i think the blue one might have been a bit lighter than i expected, but definitely not darker or more intense.i got xl which is often tight for me in ladies shirts (i am cursed with a gut problem and thin hips so men's shirts are ok but often have that ""tight"" spot across the breast. ) but was surprised to find this shirt runs big and the xl fit perfectly, non tailored, loose but not baggy, definitely a women's shirt  as a men's shirt of similar fit would have that fatal tight breast zone, requireing some strategic stretching.the cotton is very soft when you first unwrap the shirt, and medium weight. with no fabric softener it was a bit rougher after washing.  you can't see through the shirt, so i guess it is not ""shear"".  it is not a sexy, hourglass shaped, clinging to every curve, short short ladies t shirt.  i buy men's and ladie's t's, so for me this is not such a shock as for other shoppers. i would like a shorter sleeve, but other than that this is a loose fitting normal t shirt, long enough to tuck in if you choose, but hitting in a fairly attractive part of your hips for wearing out...ie, not the fattest part, but not showing your waist or butt cleavage if you have to bend over.it is possibly a bit too unisex for some t shoppers, but i can get away with this under a jacket in court, so don't knock it.i have never had to return a gildan shirt for it being too small or too big or any other problem. this model is loose and only slightly tailored for the ladies, but still attractive, especially with the sleeves shortened a bit or rolled up."
20363	the quality if fabulous.  it fit perfect.  this is my third one.  i have it in black, off-white and now brown.  i highly recommend it.
20388	the cons:  the hem on the top and the pant bottom was unraveling out of the package with a long string attached.  i love the feel of the material and how it fits.  i am large breasted so i am always concerned it the pants will be too big.  there is a nice elastic on them and they fit very nicely.  i am 5' 3&#34; and the length is perfect.  if i had paid more for the pajamas i would be upset with the hem coming out.  but as it is i am just going to mend them before it all comes out and enjoy the great night sleep i have in them.  they do not bunch and i can turn easily.  a little see through so i would be uncomfortable wearing them in front of my son.
20390	nothing fabulous about these pajamas but very functional.  washes well and doesn't wrinkle.  they are nice practical pajama set to travel with as they don't wrinkle.
20407	"the set is light and comfortable. it is not tight and very soft. i recommend it. if my feet are dry, they tend to ""drag"" on the pants as i put them on. i am planning on buying a set for my mother for christmas."
20481	these work very well for the money, but there is too much space between the hooks for most of my bras. i use them with a few masquerade bras and these extenders seem to be too wide for that brand. however they fit fine on my freya bras.
20486	i bought this for a friend for his birthday. i noticed after a few wears the color was not holding up well. it's a nice shirt but i recommend perhaps hand washing as apparently the color bleeds.
20547	i have this in black, white and taupe.  i wear it when i go on walks and hikes, but i also wear it when i am out on the weekends running all my errands.  it fits well and is very comfortable.  i need under wire in the bras i wear.  the under wire in this bra is hardly visible and does not poke out.  like how this bra lifts and hold me in.  it acts like a minimize.  in addition, the clean simple look allows for it to be worn under regular close ( a dress, a t-shirt, sweater top) without looking like you are wearing a sports bra.  no uni-boob here.
20558	"i have been buying and using these shoes for years and years, and the quality has always been great. i use them for gardening, and then swimming right after (i do both every single day) and they hold up to both. they are great traction and protection in the garden, and they are great for swimming laps and pushing off from flip turns.i usually wear a 6.5 in women's shoes and a 6 in these shoes fits fine.my issue is this: for the last several months, i have been going through these shoes like crazy. with daily use, i'm having to buy a new pair every month- either the sole gets holes in it, or the top of the shoes rips/stretches so it doesn't fit anymore. nothing has changed about the conditions or usage (same pool, same garden surface, same amount of wear) but apparently the quality of these shoes has gone really downhill. they just aren't as durable. but they are comfy and they protect my feet, so i keep buying them- i haven't found a shoe that fits as great.the other issue, and this has always been a problem- the innersole of the shoe slips. it's firmly in place when the show arrives, but after a few wears it pulls up from the bottom of the shoe and ""floats around"" as you walk/swim/etc. it's a pain in the neck. but, again, because of the fit of these shoes, i put up with it.however, i'm definitely on the search for a better shoe- if i can find one with similar fit, nice thick grippy sole, and as lightweight, i would switch in a heartbeat."
20605	had worn out my old pair to the point of holes in the soles. these are comfy, seem sturdy, and the soles are very grippy.and after reading another review i bought a size smaller than my usual shoe size and it was a perfect fit. just sayin'.
20633	these water shoes run a little large, our grandson wears a size 8, so these 8-9's are a bit big on him. they go on easily and the drawstring top tightens them up fine.  i do wish the botton was just a bit more grippy, but they serve the purspose and protect his feet around the pool. the colors are bright and they are well made enough for the price.
20690	many years ago, did a review on these jeans when i sort of starved myself, so i did wish to update what i said.  was a 6 then; now i am a healthy size 8.  took the 10 short, and while a little big, they are still that wonderful wrangler quality, fit and style.  these are cut for real women with curves, tummies, that look like real people, not stick models.  i am now over 60, and they fit in all the right places.  if you like a slightly snug fit, then take your real size.  if you like a little loose, size up.  here in austin, we go for comfort!  i cannot say enough good things about these jeans.  the fabric is also nice and soft, not that fabric that feels &#34;cardboardy&#34;.  so go for it!  these are wonderful!
20724	i really like the carhartt brand and these jeans are no exception to the rule, my only complaint is the legs run a bit narrower then i would've liked...aside from that i would recommend them to anyone looking for a lined pair of jeans for their winter wardrobe.
20801	bought this for the gym- fits my sneakers and my gym clothes, along with my other clothes, a water bottle, and even a small purse.i thought there would be other compartments in the bag but there wasnt. a little disappointed in that, but for the price its a nice size bag to fit everything and it also fits in my gym locker.
20868	loose/comfortable fit in legs and thighs w/o being baggy,thin compared to levis or carhartt jeans, so may not last as long, but nice during the hot summers.build/stitching  quality seems ok
20967	this bra is ok. i ordered a 40ddd and i believe that is my correct size. the bra fits, but lacks comfort. the underwire molded cup design is not meant for all day wear. it looks great under t shirts though. it's difficult to find bras that fit in store. i had this bra some years ago in a too small size, but always loved the way it lifted and minimized. i wouldn't have purchased it if i would have known that it lacks comfort. overall a good quality bra, but not comfortable. i recommend the playtex 4049 instead. it looks great under t-shirts and is very comfortable.
21000	long, wide, great scarf at a fantastic price. i like the fleece, easy to wash and rinse quickly and dries fast. warm for cold windy days its long enough to go around a couple times.
21011	they're the right lenght also warm, but i'm not crazy about the quality of the stitching. it's good enough for the price i think :-)
21029	i had a pair of dearfoams terry scuffs for so long i can't remember where i lived when i got them.  ten or 15 years!  i replaced my old ones with these in august 2006.  still top-notch.  comfortable, with a sturdy sole.  you can step outside if you want.  they're marvelous for those of us who don't wear flip-flops because we hate that thing between our toes.  they're just terrific in warm weather.  you can protect your soles and toes while keeping your feet cool.  the terry is very soft.  dearfoams doesn't skimp on the size, either.  order your regular size and be confident your foot won't be hanging off the edge of the sole.now that it's january, i'm wearing these slippers only occasionally.  i've washed them about 9 times, and they look practically brand new. i would buy these again.august 2008 - i haven't bought them again, because they still look and feel practically new, despite dozens of washings!march 2010 - i still have these, though they've seen better days now.  terrific value.
21063	i love these pants!  they are really comfortable and of good quality!  i use them all the time to run, walk, or just wear over shorts!
21073	for your reference, i am 5'2&#34; 128lbs and i normally wear a 34e cup bra.i purchased this swim suit for swim training and it fits perfectly. it does give me a uniboob look but it doesn't matter since i am not concerned about fashion during training. the cut on the leg was exactly where it should be and the straps are the correct length. very happy with the purchase.
21088	this device works but it is very noisy. the part that secures the watch to the system is not well designed.  if all you need is a device for keeping your watch wound then this machine does the job and the price is right.
21291	these sandals fit great and are so comfortable its like walking on a cloud! i love them and will order them in other colors as well.  the size 5 was perfect for me. the footbed is made from yoga mat and it feels great- you can walk all day long. the material in between the toe is smooth and does not irritate your skin at all.  try these and you will never wear $5.00 flip-flops again.
21363	i have high arches so i always wear birkenstock's arizona, but when winter and bad weather come around, it's important to have a closed clog for more protection and warmth. i generally buy merrell clogs for this purpose but their prices are just getting out of hand. i wear a 38n (narrow) in birkenstock and i ordered an 8 1/2 medium in this shoe; with a black pair of crew socks, i have a perfect fit. these easy spirit slip-ons do not have the arch support that i need but i replaced the insert with a merrell insert and this brought the arch of the shoe up to meet my own. this is a good way to determine if you have the proper arch support.for the moment, (until they are completely broken in), i am using these shoes as slippers around the house as i have never found a supportive slipper with enough arch support for my needs. these keep my toes warm and i can certainly run outside with them if need be. they are light as a feather and have a good solid non-slip sole. they also have a good sized toe box which is something very important for me. these shoes support my feet on the sides as well and keep my feet balanced within the shoe. great price for a very good shoe, highly recommended for fun, style and warmth.
21398	make sure you really like this item, because i was charged $8 in restocking fees. not sure where it's mentioned in the product page; i couldn't find it anywhere.
21413	my favourite type of bra for shaping. it provides good coverage and holds you in firmly.  these bras last a long time.
21414	if this longline bra ran true to size, i'd give it an enthusiastic 5 stars. i bought 2 of them. one in 38dd for my mom and another in 36c for me. neither one of us can get into them.i think this bra is fairly well made and as long line bras go, pretty as well. i also like that the hooks/eyes are in the front so you can get into it easily without hooking it first and then having to then slide it around so the hooks are in the back like some longline bras.as for the size: i'm a good sized c cup and might go up to the d cup when i reorder although it's hard to say because i couldn't actually get it on to really tell how well the cups would fit if they were in the proper place.i was able to hook two of the hooks between my breasts but only just barely and the hooks at the bottom i could get hooked but there was no way i could do them all from top to bottom. just too much of me and not enough bra to cover it all. my mother had the same problem only she couldn't even get the hooks closed at all from about halfway up to the top.i always wonder about bra reviews because so many women wear the wrong size but i've been measured at victoria's secret and macy's and by myself and i am a 36c cup. i measured my mother and the tape measure definitely says she's 38 for band size and then using the formula to figure out cup size said she should be a dd. so if you are wondering about this bra review, wonder no more because i'm reasonably certain both of us are wearing the right size and also, i never have trouble with too small band size in many other bras i buy including playtex, bali, etc.bottom line: i think this is a great longline bra, very reasonably priced, especially for a longline and it is very pretty in person but if you decide to order, i'd go up at least two sizes in your bandsize. i intend to get another two but will substitute a 40c for my usual 36c and will be getting my mother a 42dd in place of her normal 38dd.
21458	i bought a pair of the pink camo fatigues about three years ago and love them, so i decide to get another pair. i bought the olive drab and love them as well. they do run a bit large. i bought a medium, but i think i could have bought the small. the pink camo pair fit me a little big and so do these. that's ok...i love this pair as well. would recommend these paints. well made. mid weight. comfortable!
21465	just save your money and get some altamas. these are cheap junk made out of stray cats and bubble gum.
21484	i have owned these shoes in tan for around five months and they have quickly become my go-to shoes.  i was concerned about spending the money on a pair of driving shoes (because of the beating they typically take) but they have been well worth the money and i when the time comes i will replace with another pair.when i purchased these i also purchased a pair of polo ralph lauren men's telly driving shoe.  there is no comparison between the two.  the quality of the leather and the fit are the two most obvious differences.  i ordered both in my standard size, 11d.  the cole haan's slide on and off with little effort and both the width and length fit correctly.  i noticed some of the other reviews mentioned that they thought they were very narrow.  i don't have narrow feet and have had no complaints about the width.  as i have worn the cole haan's they have broken in very well and now feel almost like a slipper on my feet.  the rl's on the other hand were very difficult to get on and off.  i am sure if they were broken in more they would have become easier, but who wants to deal with that if you don't have to?the shoes work well with or without socks.  i typically wear them with jeans and an allen edmonds manistee belt in tan.  the colors match perfectly and they look great together.leave the sneakers at home and give these a try.
21502	my son loves these! he wouldn't take them off.  great tread on the bottom, and not too clunky for a 2 yr old to wear without tripping, which is important. also easy to get on and off.  very happy with this purchase.
21538	i have one of these bags from several years ago. i have used and used it and it is not in the least bit worn. i decided to replace it after a black marking pen leaked and left a large permanent stain - definitely not the bag's fault. now i have my new bag. will i keep it? yes.i read recent reviews saying baggallini had changed the bag eliminating many of the interior pockets. i went ahead and ordered the bag as the old one had far more pockets than i ever used anyway. the bag came and indeed the interior of the bag has been redesigned with quite a few missing extras. outside compartments have only 1 small pocket instead of 2 and the mesh water bottle holders are gone - i loved these for glasses. the interior has only 1 zippered pocket as compared to 3 before, the cell phone pocket is open allowing the cell phone to fall out (on the positive side it is bigger and will hold a larger phone). and most upsetting no key fob! i need a key fob and will have to jerry-rig something. finally the zippered wallet is missing the id viewer on the outside.the first customer review reporting changes to the bag is from july 2012. it is now the end of october. that is too long for an inaccurate product photo and description.
21556	i use to purchase the bloch ballet tights for my daughter, but each pair would snag, run, or get a hole in them after very little wear.  i just assumed that bloch tights would be of good quality because of the bloch dance shoes that i buy are made well and my daughter loves them.i eventually decided to buy the danskin brand for her a few years ago and i have been extremely satisfied. they are the perfect color, the perfect weight, and most important, they do not run.  if she does get a hole in them, it's because she got them caught on to something that snagged them or tore them.  she loves these tights! they are very well made and i highly recommend them.  by the way, the sizing is pretty accurate.  my daughter is 5ft 2in and she wears the ab size.you will not be disappointed with these tights!
21589	first to help with real vs. fake uggs....if you look at the left boot inside behind the label is a reflective sticker that has uggs written on it with sun's which will help let you know if they are real.the same sticker should be on the box. as of 2013 uggs changed the security feature when you turn the boot 90 degree's the sticker will change from black to white. you can go to the uggs website to see the pictures of the stickers and get a more detailed explanation. depending on what year your boots are made will depend on the security feature.next sizing....i usually wear a size 7/7.5 pending on the shoe. the uggs site tells if that if you are in between sizes to order down as their boot tends to run large, torn between a big kids 5 or 6 i ordered the big kids 5. they fit perfect, a little snug, snug with a thick sock on but.... uggs form to your feet which is what makes them soooo comfy, so after a few wears the snugness will hug my tootsie's just right with socks on. i know some like to wear with no sock but i have to wear socks.now to tell you what you probably already know... uggs... loves them, how could you not, they are like having pillows on your feet, they are like walking up a staircase of clouds taking you to heaven. yea they are that comfortable. when they first came out i swore i wouldn't jump on the bandwagon so much so that i would wear the emu and bearpaws or as i would freely admit &#34;fuggs&#34;.uggs are without a doubt the best boot in this type of style, you know the sheepskin, warm & fuzzy, cozy & comfy, that you can wear with sweats, jeans or shorts because they feel that amazing on. i have worn bearpaw, emu and other popular competitors and without a doubt uggs is definitely the way to go. the popular competitors seem to over do it with either the boots are too heavy on the feet or they don't given enough support.if you are looking to keep the feetsie's warm, want comfort and something you can wear with anything these are the boots you want. don't settle for the knocks off whether they are they are unknowns or popular competitors. ugg's loves them :)
21611	i ordered three pairs of ugg's from amazon this winter. two pairs that i received were authentic and one pair were fake.  the fake ugg's had the holographic tag, came in a box with a holographic sticker, and with packing and materials identical to the authentic ugg's -- the only way i was able to tell the fakes were that they absolutely reeked.  the boot itself smelled fine, like sheepskin, but the soles smelled very strongly of new plastic or chemicals. i could smell it before i'd even pulled them out of the box.  real ugg's do not have this smell.  go to any fine department store and smell for yourself. if you receive ugg's and the soles smell strongly of paint/chemicals/plastic... return them, they are not authentic.  if you are familiar with those foam rubber jigsaw puzzle pads they make for babies... it's that kind of smell.at the time i purchased the boots, amazon was not an authorized seller of uggs (apparently they now are), however a number of the marketplace sellers on the site are.  if you visit ugg's website, you can find a list of authorized sellers.  unfortunately, as i discovered, several sellers on amazon are using names very similar to authorized vendors but are not actually that vendor.  so be careful.  some of these folks selling the fakes are still charging $180 for the classic tall.  you will not find authentic ugg's on sale, reduced, or anything like that at any authorized site.  if you want real ugg's be prepared to pay full price for them or end up with fakes.the authentic ugg's i received were both from shoe central out of ashland, oregon -- they are an authorized dealer.  i love my ugg's. i waterproofed them and that worked well for walking in heavy snow.  my toes were toasty warm.  very comfortable.  i'm very happy!
21616	these are the best boots ever! most comfortable, warmest, durable! i started my search for boots after playing in the wisconsin snow with my daughter and my feet were frozen.  i probably had not played in the snow since i was a kid.  i researched these ordered them and now have 2 pair that have lasted 2 years no problems.  be aware order a size smaller!  i am usually a 6.5 i ordered a 6 and they work great but my friend order a 9 (she is usually a 8.5 and hers are too big!) i read in the description to order smaller she didn't read that. the cost is worth it the quality is superior to anything out there!
21617	i normally wear a 10.5 or 11, but based on reviews, bought these a little smaller in size 10. they are snug, but feel great, especially on bare feet. i do a lot of ballroom dancing and often have sore feet. after long dance practice sessions, these boots cradle my sore soles in luxuriously soft sheepskin. sometimes, i even wear them in the house like slippers because they are so comfortable. you can look at the knock offs and imitations, but real uggs are worth every penny. my recommendation is not to compromise.
21668	the cotton is not as soft as the jockey underwear i have bought him in the past, but the price is good and hubby likes the color variety and the tagless waistband.
21671	my husband loves the soft fabric waste bands on these briefs.  hanes makes alot of different styles----this is a winner!
21693	it is big. in picture it looks small but it is big in size. it works good. i use it every day.
21699	this is the only shoe polish i use on my work shoes, i love it and it will continue to buy it.
21751	i expected this to be waterproof and a lot warmer, so i have been very disappointed in it. i got soaked through every layer wearing it in rain, and it isn't as warm as i need for riding a motorcycle on a 40 degree day. i can't imagine riding a snowmobile is dryer than riding a motorcycle, and snowmobiling would be in even colder temperatures! it's not adequate at all for my needs.very disappointing.
21762	"look: it's a cheap bag that's surprisingly well made for the price, so complaints should be kept to a minimum regardless.but the one thing that vexes me -- and i purchased two of these for gifts -- is that the strap clasp is not placed appropriately.it doesn't matter that the latch on the flap is placed midway up. what matters is that the strap part -- the part on the bag body itself that loops through and back out of the latch to ""tie down"" the flap -- is sewn way too high for the depth of the flap.meaning that if you actually needed to fasten the flap closed (personally, i carry a messenger bag with a full-sized flap and no closures whatsoever, so it's not necessarily a must to secure the contents) either the bag must be so overstuffed that the flap doesn't come nearly as far down the front of the bag as it can when empty, or (and this will probably be 90% of your problematic closure encounters) the flap has to be rolled or bunched up in order for the strap end of the closure to be pulled through the latch.think of it as looking at venetian blinds, which sit beautifully flat when in their fully extended ""down"" position, but which are designed to compress accordion-style when pulled taut.this bag will have to pull taut when closed, though it's not supposed to be (and isn't) designed to do so."
21837	"i've purchased fingerless gloves exactly like this from a dollar store.  they're quite ""handy"" for me, when i can find them.  that's why i was willing to pay $2.79.  what i did not know, was that i'd be paying over $5.00 for shipping; otherwise i'd have definitely looked elsewhere! nevertheless, these cheapy-gloves are useful to wear indoors and keep my poor, cold, little hands warm while i  still get all my stuff done.  i take them off when i bathe, though."
21895	"i thought that since it ""claims"" to have a waterproof layer that prevents leakage and has a super absorbent layer to absorb wetness that my daughter would be safe wearing just that swim diaper while she waited to go swimming so i could put sunblock on her.  here is what the incorrect claim reads on the product description that you should be made aware of:-waterproof layer prevents leakage-super absorbent layer absorbs wetnessshe must have had it on for only a few minutes and peed because there was pee all over her and all over my lap.  this diaper looked great and like another reviewer said, ""it seemed to have been made real well""--but it totally did not do what it claimed to do--you'd think if it had super absorbency then it would hold pee for a minute, right?!  since this is my first child, i guess you live and learn."
21940	these look good and feel good. i got them to wear under boots and over jeans. very well made. super soft and beautiful yarn as well. i recommend you get these if you are shopping for legwarmers.
21986	"the photos are great, but the product left me wishing for more.  the straps have no adjustments and are too short and i am only 5'3"" tall.  consequently the back rides up and the band doubles over.  i feel larger breasted women need adjustable straps and they cut corners in the wrong place.bought 42c and the cups are more d sized.  my best guess for sizing is to buy 1 size smaller than you normally do.the bra is very soft and comfortable.  i do not use bras except with white or lightweight tops and this will do the job. i won't buy a second one."
21999	great shorts love them a+  a+ a+ a= a a a a a a a a a+ a+ a+ a+
22002	these are nice shorts- they are cheaper in price so do expect them to be made a  bit more cheaply you get what you pay for. that being said they are what i expected nice, comfy casual shorts.  great for either around the house, outdoors stuff, working out and things like that which is what i needed.  a tad larger than expect but not to the point i cant wear them and more than likely will be fine after some washed.  overall i do like them and would order more of different colors
22030	"this is a good looking watch; i have recieved several compliments.  the watch is not outrageously large, as are some on the market.  i selected this as i got tired of having to pay for batteries and then loosing the water-resistance.on a slightly lower note, this is a replacement for an identical watch which was unacceptably inaccurate. ( lost a full minute every day )  i contacted invicta for warranty service and was quite put off at their response.  not only would i have to pay to ship the watch to them (expected), but they wanted me to include a $28 moneyorder to pay for return shipping.  when i questioned the excessive shipping cost, i was told, "" well, that covers the international shipping to the factory.  and, the repair could take up to 90 days""  in other words, they had no stateside repair facility!  so, i would have to pay about 2/3 of my purchase price and wait 3 months to get a factory-defective watch repaired. unacceptable!at this point, i contacted amazon and they took care of me, quickly and effectively.  i love amazon !"
22053	i have a very old pair of easy spirit.  they were so comfortable, but finally showing some wear.  needed additional colors and the prices on amazon were the best i could find.  shoes fit great and love the variety of colors.  they wear well and have a nice grip on the sole.  i purchased one pair in black and one in blue.
22097	i have had foot surgery 5 times and these were the shoe i wore before and after.  i have tried many other shoes but i always come back to these.  i spent 40+ years in high heels, my house slippers even had a wedge.  now i am payiing for it.  these give me so much relief.
22126	i have these in a wide width in three colors. i love them! i have heel spurs on the back of my heels, and these are great for walking with no pressure on the heel. note, they do not work well at all for me with socks! they are a much better summer shoe than a winter! with socks they slip about, without, they are great. they do not breathe well, and my podiatrist highly recommended using foot powder every single time to avoid fungus. i purchased the superfeet blue shoe insert to go in it, and they work very well together. you can easily fit orthotics in the shoe. it is so easy to change an insert in and out of it.
22176	i think a bra is a difficult item to buy even in the stores.  you never really know till you have worn it for a day.  once you find the right bra you go back and they don't carry it anymore and you startthe search again and buy several hopeing that it will be the right one.  i could not believe that i could look for a specific bra and find it.  i love this bra it is so comfortable and the fact that it is cotton is perfect since i live in an area that can be hot and humid at times.
22183	lightweight, easy on, great fit and no cellulite. the pocket is perfectly iphone-sized! i've worn through a pair now, and have two more i'm working on ;)
22231	they're exactly what i expected for $17. not the classiest thing i could buy, but they go well with many looks for me. the pearls are about 7mm as advertised and the clasps are sterling silver. i really like the clasps that stay put so i don't lose them. all in all a great product at a great price.
22325	these tear really easily.  i feel like i shouldn't complain because they are really affordable, but....  they probably work well for indoor use.  i just wanted something to keep the mud and animal droppings out of the treads of my shoes, and they do that ok.  but they do tear and leak, so don't count on them for protection from wet.
22366	these are terrific flip flops.  they have good arch support and the soles haven't squished down like other brands of flip flops i've had.  i've been wearing them almost daily for months and they're practically like new.
22440	you gotta give it to the japanese. they put four cylinders in a mid-size car and the car has muscle, good looks, and refinement. this orange monster has muscle, good looks, and is one of the most accurate watches i've ever owned! it ticks (sweeps) right along with my timex easy reader (which is the most accurate watch i own).  one can feel the quality in the build of this watch. it is a brick. i own watches up and down the bunny trail, from solar atomic to watch snob automatics. the bracelet is very comfortable (better than most). the power reserve is better than any automatic in my collection. please do not set the day/date between 9pm-4am. i did that and it caused the watch to stop running after 30 min. consistently. however, i rotated the time forward for a 24hr cycle. whatever, had the hands hung up went away. it has been running like a top since, two years now. this watch behaves like it has a battery inside. amazing.
22531	i picked this one up. a little cheaper than i see here on amazon.  for the price i paid, i like it.  i like the fact that it has an alarm. i have read other reviews about the alrm being too quiet. i don't use mine to wake up, i use it as a reminder.  it's fine for me. it's a nice looking watch. i've owned it for a few months and haven't had any strap issues.i like this more as a  suit watch, not so much casual wear. the contrast on the face is not as bold as it looks in these photos. i like it overall.
22560	bought and then returned it... the face of the watch is really small and almost looks like a womans watch. i like my watch faces over sized. this one just didn't do anything for me...
22580	perfect for my son to wear when he started college.  numbers are big and easy to read without interference with all the unnecessary fancy chronograph dials.  basic in style and appropriate for casual or dress.  love the fact that it doesn't need batteries.  feel more secure that it won't suddenly stop and screw up time reading for the day.  also hate having the hassle of buying so many batteries for our watches and the danger of not doing it quick enough to avoid battery leakage.
22588	i stumbled onto this watch after having looked at many chronograph types.having read lots of the reviews here i was aware of comments about the band, and now owning the watch, i realize they had a point. on the other hand i like the drab green against the black watch face. so removing the grommets was done to see if it would effect the stiffeness.i discovered the grommets are what makes the band too stiff. the bandmaterial itself is not overly stiff. its all that metal.removing the grommets transforms the band. for example the end of the band now tucks effortlessly into its loop keeper, whereas with the grommets in place it required bending and guiding.heres what it looks like minus the grommets:[...][...]to remove the grommets you need to slide a narrow screwdriverinbetween the grommet and the band on the black side. twist thescrewdrvier and it will displace the grommet a little. do that a fewtimes right next to each other and you will create a lip that canbe grabbed by pliers and the halves of the rivet can be pulledapart. its not hard. dont use more force than necessary.as far as reviews go, i find the combination of never needing to change batteries and the sealed back, plus the no-nonsense look and size of the case, make for a near perfect package. it would be nice if citizen offered a few models that 'riff'on this one.. for example different face color(s) and band choices and case finishes. in itself and for what it was designed to do, its a very very strong product. the price makes it a no brainer.buy one.
22606	i own 6 diver watches on rubber straps including a new doxa sub 1200t. this citizen cost a fraction of what i have spent on my other dive watches. however this is the one i get the most satisfaction out of wearing. the one piece case is unique to any others that i own and it is really a work of art. the stainless is nicely finished and the edges are all rounded over and polished. i have about 6 eco drives and have never had any issue with any of them. they just keep running, and it is nice to know that most likely you will never have to open up this watch for service. i don't dive and i really like the medium size of the watch. some say it is too small, and it may be if you use it for diving. it is a great size for my taste however..i don't care much for the huge watches that are popular now.  maybe if you are ordering online try to see one in person first to see if the size is an issue for you. i just love wearing this even if my seikos are a little larger. oh, and that doxa, it is very similar in size to this citizen!!
22632	when it has came down to citizen, they definitely have made some excellent watches, time and time again. but nevertheless, there are some pieces that they have made that could have had a bit more to match. this citizen eco-drive piece is alright. but it does display a mixture of both accents and numerals 4, 8, and 12 on the piece. it is alright but honestly it could have had a bit more in its features. it snugs very comfortably around the wrist and is easy to setup on the time. yet, i did though wish there could have been a little more in its features including illuminated hands that glow in the dark, and a bit more in the feature of the face. still, you do get a quality watch from citizen eco-drive, but more could have been added here in this solar timepiece.price: c+comfort & setup: c+overall: c+
22648	very very small watch, not close to worth the money they charge for the watch. i returned the watch. thank you.
22665	this dress makes you want to dance and shimmy! it is so much fun. as some other reviewers said, it is tight around the hips and butt, so keep that in mind when ordering. it is such a flattering dress you'll want to wear it for more than just halloween!
22670	my watch battery died and there was no way i was getting the back opened on my own.  the little watch stand in the mall was going to charge me over $20 just go take the back off and change the battery. i decided instead just to purchase this tool and a watch battery myself and how i can change the watch battery myself.  the tool comes in a little wooden box with multiple different attachments to adjust to opening different types of watches. i would recommend getting some sort of a watch holder to keep the watch in place when you are using the tool because it can take a little effort but my experience would have been easier if i had something to hold the watch still for me so that the watch itself as well as the little screws in the tool wouldn't slip off the watch.. all in all, if you want to be able to open your watch back yourself or change batteries i would say this will do the job.
22672	ordered this to open my husband's sports watch because it had the indents in the back that had to be turned.  he followed the directions and opened it easily with no problem.  saved taking it to a jeweler to change the battery.  would highly recommend for all waterproof watches that have that case that does not pop off with a knife.
22693	this is a beautiful anklet! i was pleased with the design and the ease of being able to wear it every day! i've not taken it off since it arrived and it's held up under socks, in the shower, and in bed. and though i haven't worn it with hose yet, it doesn't seem to snag. it's a simple clean and subtle design and if you do leave it on, you will hardly know it's there. you will not regret a purchase of this item.
22707	great product to buy, its simple and i have been wearing it ever since i got it to get it used to my ankle. the anklet is really thin and i thought with at least one good tough pull that it would break and fall off. so far it hasnt (and i tested it with a few accidents myself), showing its remarkable sturdiness or whatever its called xs. i also appreciate the fast shipping, a great anklet to buy!
22714	"i've worn this chain for three years, nonstop (i only took it off one time for an x-ray!), and it's still in great shape! so it lasts a long time too! i really wish i could give it 4.5 stars instead of 4!****************************this is a beautiful chain for a pendant (or like me, a saint's medal!).  it has a lovely intricate design that i haven't seen before and is quite stunning. the chain is a tad bit shiny, so keep that in mind. i've worn mine solidly for a month now, take showers & sleep in it, and it's still holding up, as is my 6 year old daughter's chain, who also wears it sleeping, playing, and all that rough stuff that kids do.  neither one has shown any signs of weakness and for the price, i highly recommend it.the only flaw i saw was that one or two tiny links were ""bunched"" up with each other, i was able to fix all but one by simply pulling them and trying to wiggle it.  i still haven't fixed the last one but i am afraid to break the chain, and since it is minor it's staying. i would recommend the chain more for women than men, although if your man isn't particularly picky.... it seems more feminine to me with the fancy design.i plan on buying more for my other children when i get around to it!!"
22775	fast service.  nice shirt.  a little stiff, but should mellow with age. graphics are very nice, and look like they will last, unlike some.
22873	what i received is cute, fur lined, well sewn. it is true to size.  i wear 9.5, and ordered 9 in these because the first pair really was way too long to be an accurate 9.5. these are snug, but think they will stretch. i have narrow feet and they are good. i did not yet contact the company about this error, so i cannot say as to how they would respond. they have a thin but firm man made sole.  these will be good for keeping at work when i need to slip into something more comfortable or when i drive to work in my scrumptious acorn chinchilla slippers and forget to bring a pair fo shoes to change into (happened once!) .  minnetonka makes very high quality products - the low score is for sending me the wrong model - not even anything close. the delivery is fast and they have good packing.
22937	i have an old kipling bag that is almost identical to this bag for the past 15 years. i ordered this as a replacement because the old one has finally worn out from heavy use over the years at the corners and at where the handle-strap is sewn to the body of the bag.most of the features of this new bag are well thought-out improvements to my old bag. the organizer sections (pda, cellphone, pens) in the large front zippered section, the 2 zippered pockets (one for 3-1-1 toiletry ziplock, the other for inflatable pillow, pashmina, ipod etc) and of course the trolley-sleeve in tha back that enables this bag to be slipped over trolley handles for convenience. my old bag just had one large wide pocket in the front, no organizer sections and no trolley sleeve.the one thing they did add, that i don't like is that the entire bag is lightly padded, presumably to help it keep its shape when partly full. this padding adds weight and bulk to this bag. it weighs-in at 2-lbs! my old bag was just 1-lb. ordinarily this wouldn't make that much of a difference, except that this is meant to be a travel bag and discount carriers and intra-europe flights have a weight limit of 5-kg/11-bs. with a laptop weighing 3-4 lbs, add the weight of the 3-1-1 bag and you don't have much to work with.i love the updates (except for the padding) and the new colors it now comes in (they used to only make bags in their basic colors: navy, red, black) and have used this bag as an overly large handbag/tote bag, an overnighter, a weekender, a gym bag, a diaper bag and of course as my carryon. this size can just squeeze by as a personal or 2nd bag on trans-atlantic/pacific flights on the larger planes.if they only removed the padding and went back to the removable semi-firm bottom panel, i would give it 5 stars.
22940	have the set and love it! the bags hold up very well and are worth the money spent, i love the color so i can spot it when picking up my luggage... the sherpa travel bag has so much room, tons of pocket space and is just a wonderful bag to have...plan to use it for years to come as i travel the world!
22962	i needed a new pair of shoes to replace the sneakers i always wear. i love these shoes, very comfortable, nice sole, good fit to my foot. i'm wearing these all the time, since i received them a week ago. after i purchased them, i read some of the reviews, all i can say, for the moment, i'm happy with them. i'll see how they wear in the future.
22990	i take a men's size 12, which is what i ordered, and these fit like a size 10-10.5 on me.the shoes are very well made and look sharp...and i've experience with rockport walkers in the recent past...so i feel qualified in rating them, and give 'em 4 stars...but i cannot fit into these comfortably, hence i'm taking a star off for poor sizing.i am going to try/buy these locally now since the size seems to be such an issue...and donate this pair to our local thrift.
23042	i have high arches and wear orthodics in my shoes for extra support.  i also have a little bit of foot pain from plantar fasciitis, which i control by wearing shoes with orthodics.the problem is, when i wake up in the morning (or am hanging around the house) i don't want to put on 'real shoes' - i just want to slip something on so that i don't have to walk around barefoot (which hurts after a bit).birkenstock only has two models with high arches - this one (boston) and the arizona.  both in taupe suede.  i bought both.let's face it, they are not the most attractive shoes...  but i think the boston looks better than the arizona when wearing pants/jeans.  however, in the summertime, when it is hot - your feet will sweat in the boston!  so i bought the arizona for hot days/shorts and the boston for cool days/pants.again, they are not stylish or attractive, but they are comfortable.  and they will get more comfortable with age.  as you wear them they will mold around your feet, making them even more comfortable.regarding sizing:  the suede stretches.  i have been wearing birkenstocks on and off for 20 years.  and the suede stretches more than the leather.  but the suede is definitely more comfortable.  so be prepared, as it stretches, to add a hole or two to make them tighter (i use an ice pick, knife or scissors to make additional holes).  (you will know it has stretched when your toes start to hit the front of the shoe.)  with other shoes i opt to get the shoe a bit bigger for comfort (especially to give room for my orthodics), but with this shoe i go true-to-size.  (e.g., with other shoes i wear a women's 9.5, but with this shoe i wear a 39 narrow).lastly - i am not sure if it is always the case, but when i bought them they were cheaper here on amazon than they were on the birkenstock website!yay for comfortable shoes!  :)
23065	lenses are big and arms are not long enough; so, glasses fit very tight around the ears. sure wish they had one size fits all. those wrap around the ear arms are the worst
23112	i bought these because they were polarized and cheap!  i don't like to pay an arm and a leg for sunglasses and these have done what i need them to do by cutting the glare and being uv safe.
23175	these shoes fit true to size and are super comfortable.  i wear a size 7, so ordered 38 in these shoes. after wearing these birks for a week, i ordered another pair in red. no breaking in period.
23189	if this bra had fit, i still wouldn't have kept it. it is, as with all microfiber (aka tshirt) bras, very stretchy, so i always order a band-size down (32 instead of 34). however, the cups are huge. i was looking for a demi bra - or something with less coverage than this. it is more a 3/4 or full-cup bra when i get the correct size, and that isn't for me. if you want a demi bra, get something else. also, the shoulder straps are set for a frame larger than mine. they barely rested on the edges of my shoulders, and i am not a small girl there. this bra would definitely be visible around the edges of most summer tops - tanks, and other tops that show the chest or are sleeveless.
23221	best jewelry cleaner i have ever used & the great price is what prompted me to try this brand! no more will i spend $10 a jar at wal-mart for jewelry cleaner & i do alot of cleaning & polishing!
23249	the wallet is well made and holds a lot of stuff and keeps things nicely organized, but the wallet is too thick for my taste.  i have been hoping that by sitting on it for a while that it would compact down some and it has, but it is still much thicker than i like.  that being said, i still like it a lot and cannot downgrade it too far for that one flaw.
23274	i like the button which opens and closes it. it collapses to a small size, so it's handy to travel with.
23292	this cleaner does the job. i liked that it didn't have a strong smell or burn my fingers when cleaning like other cleaners. i did have to put some elbow grease into it when rubbing with the cloth, but that may just be from the vintage condition of some of the sterling jewelry. i'd def buy again.
23298	great product. works very well in cleaning jewelry especially in a jewelry cleaner.  i definitely would purchase this product again.
23321	it oxidizes my jewelry pieces so i don't like it!!all my jewelry were stained with this product... i was really mad
23334	not shore what to say. it dose work but doesn't seem to work as good as the stuff at the jewelry store they use.
23383	bought this as a gift for a friend who isn't much into backpacks or other carry totes who takes hikes. very roomy, fits a few items of clothing, smaller accessories, cell phone pouch with a good amount of space to pack it in and take off. he loves it.
23406	just got back from europe and this bag worked great. i love the length of the straps for over the shoulder.  flat bottom sits well; be careful not to overfill so it will still fit under the plane seat. i ordered black and would like to have the bronze color too for summer travel.
23414	when it comes to this tote, i like it and i don't like it. the material is shiny and nice looking, but almost too shiny for a guy. i decided to keep it because it will hold a lot of items when i do too much shopping at cvs or rite aid. i would like it better if the handles were shorter and a little stronger. also, i kind of wish they were stitched closer to the top of bag. the inside is a nice tan color with a large zippered pocket and a small pocket for a smaller ipod or small cell phone. on the front, it has 3 open slightly deep pockets and 1 zippered pocket in middle. there is a wide deep pocket on back for something light like paperwork, etc. it is held closed by the back handle. the only other negative is the fixed bottom, which makes it hard to fold up smaller. otherwise, i guess it makes the bag stronger. folded, it is about 8.5&#34; deep and 18&#34; long, so you would have to have a long plastic bag to carry it in until you get out the store. that is what i do, unless i do it near the exit door. if you are driving, just carry it under your arm or in hand, or transfer items to bag when you get to car.
23465	great quality and size. wipes clean. trusted brand. this bag has been all over the world and never failed. holds a lot.
23497	"the fireman hat we got was not like the one in the picture.  it's very poor quality.  the sticker in the front is not as attractive as the one in the picture.  it's a small round sticker that says ""fire chief"" on it that is extremely cheap looking.  actually the sticker has been halfway unstuck from the hat from the day we got it.  even the plastic is flimsy.  maybe a nice hat shipped with this at one point in time but the hat that is being shipped now is not the same hat and it isn't worth buying."
23578	these sneakers feel a little cheaper than i thought they would.  i wonder if i had tried them on in a store if i would have purchased them?  they just don't seem to be the quality i expected after all the terrific reviews.  they are comfortable and true to size.  i will keep them.
23662	"i have several brands of sandals and keen tops them all! the venice is slightly less clunky looking then the newport model. but the newport hugs the foot a bit more. the footbed of keen sandals is the selling point, no other sandal comes close. the sizing of keen, and in fact all sandals being sold now, is confusing. i have sandals bought 5 years ago in columbia brand that are one size smaller and are the same size as the keen. i noticed other brands seem to be tending that way too. i found new balance and merrel shoes seem to be trending the same way (like a 8 is now a 9) you will find keen sandals selling used on ebay for almost new price because they are so loved and last forever. there are many sandals in other brands that ""look"" like keen. try them on and they are not even close in comfort. you will not regret buying keen sandals. comfort wise, the newport model (which i order here on amazon too) is a bit better fit because of more straps. i have a narrower foot then some and that may be why. the bumper toe on all of them is very clever and well needed if your going to wear the shoe. but i love them both. i know the price is hefty... try checking off season and amazon usually has some at a better price (maybe closeout models?)"
23673	i have bad feet (multiple surgeries on both feet) so i have to be careful what i put on my feet as far as comfort.  my feet &#34;sing&#34; when i wear my keens (i own multiple pairs).  and the best part is that they are cute - the best of both worlds when it comes to shoes!
23774	perfect quality work pants! great price and great fit! i would highly recommend these pants for nurses ad culinary workers!
23818	bought these for my 15-year-old son for valentine's day.  he had been wanting some &#34;cool&#34; shades.  read the reviews on the original wayfarer.  saw some unhappy reviews.  decided to go with the &#34;new wayfarer.&#34;  good decision.  they fit him perfectly.  got the 55mm lens.  would definitely buy again if he ends up losing these or stepping on them which is a high possibility with a teen.
23839	i purchased these in 52 mm from amazon because i'm a petite girl and based on the reviews here, 55 mm seemed too big for me. when i received them, they fit my face ok but then i went to sunglass hut to try on the 55 mm and that one looked even better! everything else about these ray-bans (quality, the way it looked) was great except the size. i decided to exchange my 52 mm for the 55 mm. amazon told me to return my old pair and make a new order. however, the price increased only a week after i purchased mine and amazon was very nice to honor the old price that i paid. i love amazon! i would recommend trying it on in store before buying if possible.
23866	just got mine recently and from the looks of it, it looks authentic, all the ray ban logos are on the right places and the build quality is excellent. click here for my video review: [...]
23879	this fits me better now that i lost some weight and my face got skinnier.  before, i looked like a chipmunk with really tiny glasses on.  it even fit my 4 years old's face better than mine.
23913	he actually gets complimented on them often. the size is a little tricky. i would go with these for your average man, but if he has a big head go bigger than 55 mm.
23920	i really wanted to like these, but... you should try them on in the store first unless you've worn them before. i bought the large and they were still too small for my face. the ear pieces do not flex much -- there is no spring in the hinge area. and if you've been wearing aviator styles with thin frames around the lenses these will be a shock. the thick lens frames will feel like you are trying to look around the center post that separates the windows in your car. they create a blind spot of sorts. if you can live with that -- no worries. they are a great traditional style. just be sure the size fits you as to width across the face.
23923	these glasses have a different look. the matte blue color is definitely trendy. just be prepared to be able to pull it off....
24025	"beautiful deep navy blue with white piping and buttons. a classic pajama set. size is precise. my only complaint is the top is cut straight from armhole to hem, no flair, no extra room. if you have a tummy :) get the next largest size. large seems to be made for height of approx. 5'8"", so consider going up a size or to a tall, if you need longer bottoms. all in all, a typically exceptional izod product from a trustworthy flordia retailer. very satisfied!"
24050	this is the perfect costume to teach children blind allegiance to a fascist state and willingness to become a faceless disposable minion for the ambition of corrupt officials.
24129	these are classic fake black market ck underwear.  the label was really crude and they were incredibly small for a medium us size.  very thin material as well.  do not buy.  you will be disappointed. i will never buy clothing again on amazon.  plus 22 bucks for one pair!!!!  zero stars!!!
24131	"while this underwear is initially great, they do ride immensely after a bit of walking around.  i say ""initially"" because, when you put them on for the first time, they really do feel magical.  i ordered a pair, and because they felt so wonderful when i put 'em on, i rushed to see if they had different colors on sale as well.  indeed there were, so i got another pair.now, for $24 (as of this writing), they should feel like you never want to take them off.  when you put 'em on, they conform to your body immediately.  i had a pair of cks years ago, but they gave me wedgies, so i stopped wearing them.  i figured now, what with all the rave reviews on amazon, i'd try the micro modals.maybe it's just the way my body's made, as i do have larger-than-normal hips for a guy, but i find that i adjust myself after a short walk with these on, and i shouldn't have to do that with $24 undies.  i look forward to switching to my hanes, when it should be the other way around.i won't give them less than 3 stars because the fact is they feel great when not walking, and look great too (around the house in private, that is).  but they get no more stars than that because i should feel comfortable in them all the time."
24160	i bought these boots for my son who is working in the northern mountains of new mexico where it has been cold for a few months and snowing for a few weeks. i hope these boots will do what the ad states and keep his feet warm and dry
24187	i would rather replace batteries than buy new watches. i had been using small screwdrivers to remove the backs of watches. sometimes, i attempted to remove the backs with steak knives. i couldn't always get the backs off. when i recieved this kit, i removed the backs from three watches that i thought i would have to take to a jeweler. i think that the kit has paid for itself!the reason that i can't give this 5 stars is that there were no instructions.i had ordered a watch repair guide that explained how to get the backs off using this equipment and/or other tools that i could have ordered from amazon.
24218	i love this little thin band. i wear it on my thumb and it is thin enough that it doesn't bother me while i am working. silver is my favorite colour when it comes to jewlery and this little ring shines and silver is so easy to take care of. i love it!sterling silver 2 mm  1/16 in.  thin wedding band / toe ring / thumb ring size 8
24256	"i have big boobs. there, i said it.i have such big boobs, in fact, that the largest cup size (ddd) of this particular model is just a teensy bit too small to hold in my particular sweater puppies. but i buy them anyway because bali got it right with this one; in fact i've gone through several because they're the only bras i wear.the under-wires, though they will eventually break (it's inevitable if you are blessed with enormous melons), are comfortable, which is hard to be if you're an underwire.the cups themselves are soft and cozy, and there are no seams - no bullet bras here!the straps are padded where they should be, as opposed to way too far in front like some of the more ""just add more fabric to the cup"" types of extra-endowed bras out there...those folks don't realize that the massive mammaries drag the bra *forward*...which means if you leave the straps the same as for the b-cuppers, those half-conceived padded bits will be somewhere on the front of the shoulder, doing nobody any good at all.lastly, you should know this is not a minimizer. at all. and why should it be?! be proud of your assets! don't strap em' in like they did something wrong! let them be round and bouncy and pleasant for all to behold, including you. grab one of these accurately-sized bras (measure yourself first, check online for the way to do it properly) and a v-neck t-shirt, and let em' be happy hooters.the only thing i wish for this bra would be a few more cup sizes, and more color... if i could, i'd buy this bra in every color of the rainbow. i'd buy two of each, in fact, and some for friends as well."
24262	"this is a fantastic bra for the price.  it is comfortable, supportive, provides lift, and the cups are nicely lined. the only reason i am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the cups seemed to run a bit large.  i am 5'2"" and 140lbs and am pretty consistently a 34dd.  the dd cups were too big and wrinkled when i tried the bra on, so i exchanged the bra for a 34d and i am extremely happy.  you may just want to order 1 cup size smaller than usual"
24324	i so want to give a four or five star review for this little ballerina box. it's gorgeous! the cunning little drawers! the sweet, soft ballerina paintings! it plays swan lake! but, oops, it did play swan lake. the wind up mechanism broke after only a few days, and now the ballerina does not twirl and the pretty box is silent. my little girl still likes it, and maybe this is just the way of ballerina boxes, but i wish it were more durable.
24345	"although the hat smells like chemicals, its adorable (and hey, i suppose i know for sure it's new right?) i will certainly order more colors of this hat, but i will look for another seller. my hat was over a week late and when i got the box it looked like megatron and his transformer friends had played football with my package; while i can't fault the seller for what the postal service does i can absolutely fault them for their piss poor service. when i kindly and concisely asked for a status on my week late package, the following is the response i received: ""hello. please contact amazon/fba team. they handled your order and will have information."" really? could you at least pretend to be sorry or care? got it, it's a straight forward situation and not ""your problem"" ehats, but your manner of handling customers and the impression it leaves is 110% your problem. i am not impressed."
24400	these flip flops are so easy on your feet. i have very tender feet, especially between my toes and i can wear these all day.i do find these to be pretty true to size. i wear a 7 1/2 , i bought a size 8 . they are just a tad to big, but very comfortable anyway.i thought a little pricey, bur probably worth it.
24520	hubby and i have been together for over 16 years. he used to work in construction, and has experienced some injuries that make comfortable shoes as necessary as they are hard to find. the ball of his foot is very wide, and his heel is fairly narrow. he wears a size 12 eee. these are the first shoes he's been able to wear in complete comfort since we met! he's tried everything, and we were just about to resign ourselves to the fact that he would never find comfortable shoes.the toe-box has plenty of room in the extra-wide width, the heel doesn't slip, the reinforced toe isn't heavy like a steel-toe, and the shank in the arch is sufficient for all the shoveling he does. and he doesn't take them off as soon as we get home at the end of the day. he walks a lot, several miles with the dogs twice a day, and the first couple of days he wore them, he came in looking for them, forgetting that he had them on. the fit is perfect and the boot is very light, compared to work-boots.i didn't know i was holding such feelings about his shoes, but when someone you love is never comfortable and not likely to be for a long time, i guess you just live with it. he was so happy and amazed by the comfort of these hikers, i nearly cried with relief. so, yes, we'd buy them again, and will get wolverines for him from now on.
24529	i have been pricing this watch in retail stores for over a year. last year it was $325.oo and this year it was going for $525.00.  i was able to get if on amazon for almost half the price and it is the exact watch. love, love, love it!
24561	nice cloths, but not needed. turns out just regular rags worked just fine.  i regretted the purchase... size is okay though.
24574	nothing remarkable.  the white inner cloth does clean a bit better when damp (not wet) and the outer blue one shines things up nicely.  it states not to use it with pearls or 14kt gold or higher as it will scratch.  i don't know if it is just a disclaimer to protect themselves, but i'm not going to take the chance!
24589	i bought this for my father, who has bigfoot status sized feet lol, we usually have difficulty finding shoes that will fit him in the width. but these were amazing. he put them on and absolutely loved it! the fit was perfect and they were very soft on the inside. worth the buy, and they actually withstand quite a bit of wear had them for almost a year now and they still are holding up pretty good for him and he uses these as his main shoes :)
24671	"this is probably the best toy i've ever bought, and i didn't even really use it! the gun does not come with any shots so buy a pack or two with your order. i knew this when i placed my order and didn't get any shots because i had different plans for it. the hammer pulls down just like you'd want it to and rotates the barrel to load another shot. the whole this has a few fake plastic screws on it but most of the parts are actually just fused together in production with the exception of the handle, plastic painted like wood, which has a single screw. since i didn't get any shots i can't say much about the range or accuracy of the gun. what i used mine for was a costume prop. first i unscrewed the handle and popped it off, then using a dremel tool i carefully separated the two halves of the butt of the gun and gently pried the two apart. the inner workings are actually a little complex for a cute kid's toy and i was impressed. after opening it i gutted some parts and installed a flag that would pop out the end and say ""bang!"" as part of my joker costume. the gun put back together really well and now i have a fun prop on my shelf until i wish to wear my costume again. the orange tip does come out easily if you open it up, but once closed again it wont budge. i do not recommend removing the tip if you're going to have this thing outside of a display.i'm thinking about getting another, this time with some shots to shoot at my house mates."
24774	i recently purchased these shorts for my husband,and he loved them. they are so pretty and comfotable, and definitely worth every penny. i highly recommend these shorts. they have plenty of pockets, and a drawstring in the waist for a perfect fit. these are the best i have ever seen.
24837	i bought this in 2008 directly from amazon.  it cost $22 back then, and arrived within a week with free super saving shipping (which is basically standard shipping).  it arrived securely in a cardboard shipping box.  nothing was damaged during shipping and all materials were new.it does what it's suppose to do, which is hold my clothes while i'm traveling.the material is made out of cheap fabric, but it's durable.  none of the seams are broken, nothing is tearing, there are no holes or anything, zipper works just fine, shoulder straps works.  shoulder strap is adjustable.  there is a zippered front pocket compartment, and pocket compartments on each side of the duffel.
24844	flimsy garbage. thinner materials and build than the photo would let on. chinese-made. i got this because it looked like a nice overnight bag. it resides in my car trunk holding jumper cables and crap now. not happy with it.
24860	i bought this as a gift for a niece.  she told me that she liked it a lot and so did her friends.
24915	i bought this bra based on reviews and it did not disappoint. it is true to size, has nice wide bands, and is very pretty and soft. it was instantly comfortable and did not bother me as the day went on. both cups and band fit well and were comfortable. everything stayed put! i am very happy and ordering many more as we speak!
24933	i like the dress itself. i have got a plus size, and was highly disappointed. the open front tries to run back to my butt making a huge very ugly whole in the front. yes, i have a big butt, but it's not as big - size 16. and advertised plus size will, perhaps, only look good on 8-10 butt size. but plus means up to 1-3x! it will perhaps stretch on to a girl of 3x on the top, but the open front will look ugly. i am returning the item, cause for 17 dollars it's too bad-looking on big girls. do not purchase plus size if you are more than size 12, it will not look good on you. especially if you are also tall.
24941	i like dress watches and usually wear something more elegant than this casio watch, but i felt like having something casual and thought it would be fun to have a digital watch like i had when i was a kid.this watch is great for me because it's big and beefy but very lightweight.  it probably weighs a lot less than any of my other watches, yet it seems fairly durable, and it's so inexpensive that you don't really worry about it if anything should happen to it.one of my favorite things about this watch is its simplicity.  with a quick glance i can see what day it is, including the day of the week, in addition to the time.  i know that might not seem like a big deal to most people, but i'm kind of absent minded sometimes, so it's actually nice for me when i can look at my watch and see that ok, today is saturday.  yes, i can do this on some of my other watches, but they have dials mostly, some of them that need to be set periodically, so i can't really trust that maybe i set it correctly, or else they are tiny and hard to see.also i like the timer feature, for when i am cooking something and i can't hear the timer in the kitchen because maybe i am too far away.some reviews i read say the buttons are very hard to push, which i found to be true in the very beginning of owning the watch, but after an initial breaking in period, they are a little bit easier.  not to say they are a soft touch, they do require some effort.  the upside is that you're not likely to push one of the buttons and change a setting by accident by bumping it.
24944	g-shock doesnt disappoint. this watch wears well, and has all kinds of 'fancy' features. im in emergency medicine and this watch is perfect
24955	"i received this watch from my girlfriend for my birthday and was very impressed with it straight out of the box (before trying it on, more on that later).  it was in my top three g-shocks that i was considering so i was thrilled that i got it.it is very sturdy and well constructed.  the digits are easy to read and the back light is very bright and it allows you to read all functions in low light conditions.  it has some very useful features and multiple alarms with a snooze features.when i put it on this is where things came apart, and i have the same complaints as many others on here.  the textured ""nubs"" on the back of the watch are awful.  i have thick skin and it is in no way sensitive, but those textured nubs will rub your skin raw.  what an awful idea!  if they were smooth, they would still be bad but the fact that they are textured will grate your skin.  also, the buttons have far too much resistance.  if you need to navigate through some of the functions, it will leave indentations on your finger because you have to press the buttons so hard.  not practical.to summarize, the watch was returned within 24 hours for those two cons.  they were so bad that it completely ruined the watch for me.pros:- attractive- relatively lightweight- sturdy- legible displaycons:- horribly uncomfortable- buttons are too difficult to press"
24963	they look like something made by a 7 year old taiwanese kid...who just stared making boots.  the material looks cheap and feels cheap (the black is not as glossy as in the pictures of them online). i sent mine back and paid a few dollars more for a super sweet burberry boot. i cannot tell you how cheap they look and feel to the touch!
25005	i received these and was excited until i put them on. the bridge connecting the lenses was not bent, and as a result the glasses were very lopsided when put on. i looked ridiculous! i was really upset because this happened to another pair of mirrored aviators i got from amazon. they are cheap glasses, so i am not too surprised about this, but i am upset it happened with two different pairs from two different sellers :(
25061	levi stopped making my go-to jeans a couple of years ago, and i've been looking for some new basic jeans ever since. nothing really fit right until i tried these, and wow! these look and feel great. i'm not constantly adjusting the waist or shimmying around in them. they just feel effortlessly nice. i'm 5'5&#34; and ordered the short length, and i'm not stepping on these at all. i ordered two more pairs and couldn't be happier with all of them. i only wish they had some in lighter colors too!
25108	the standard 8926 is listed in invicta's 2008 catalog as having a 43mm diameter and this 3044 is listed as having a 47mm diameter crown, which doesn't seem like much difference, just 4mm.  well, the 4mm makes a huge difference. the images in invicta's catalog don't come close to showing how big the face of this watch is, compared to the standard 8926. also with the bigger face, the luminous hour markers are bigger than those on the 8926, making the face brighter and easier to read in the dark. the bracelet is scaled bigger too, compared to the bracelet on the 8926, 22mm vs 20mm. the hinge on the bracelet is a precision made hinge instead of the stamped sheet hinge of the 8926.  the exhibition case back, as on the 8926, is a nice touch for us automatic watch fans. the watch has a diving helmet on the face and band. the invicta name is prominent on the face, side of the case and clasp. the scalloped edge bezel similar to an omega. it is a pretty watch on it's own, styled much like classic swiss diving watches.  the automatic movement, especially with the viewing window on the back of the case, is for us old school automatic watch enthusiasts.  being an automatic it will not keep time as precise as a quartz watch.  i have found mine to be one minute per week fast, which is acceptable for an automatic for me.  i was looking for an automatic diver with a big easy to read face, classic styling, reasonably priced, this works for me.
25119	it is expensive looking and feels the same. i am a collector.i am glad i got this one. impressive
25263	one of my late, larger than life uncles could warm the air with a stream of salient cusses so unique that no one minded. one thing he liked was carhartt's quality. some things remain, and i continue to appreciate the workmanship in carhartt products. this is one generously proportioned, carefully constructed work shirt; these guys don't skimp. for once, if you order an xxl, it will be really roomy. so, if you normally find xxl a little too big, the x-large may be large enough. you get every penny's worth from this totally practical shirt, it's truly durable and will last a long time while looking professional. the only caveat is be aware that this soft and comfortable high-quality shirt consists of thick heavy-duty fabric, appropriate for cool/cold weather. carhartt provides the real thing, this is not for ornamental or pretend-work wear. a borgnine thumbs-up. enjoy.
25300	i bought 4 of this ring, one for each of my three sisters and one for myself.  i like the delicate, filigree celtic knot heart design.  we all have small hands and fingers.  this ring design doesn't overwhelm our hands.
25346	they didn't turn me off, either, and i was kind of wrong.don't misunderstand:  this bra is great.  it's an awesome t-shirt bra, it's comfortable, it's well made, and if you don't mind the coning, definitely go for it.however, if you're thinking it'll give you the same kind of coning retro lingerie will give you, you'll be disappointed.  the retro coning has an almost pyramid shape to it; your breasts come to a point.  a dull one, sure, but there's an implied sharpness underneath it.  this coning is somewhere *between* that coning and no coning at all.  too pointed to be modern, too dull to be vintage.  if you're over a d cup (as i am), it's just gonna look a little weird in a t-shirt.  but if you've got anything up to and including a d cup, you probably wouldn't notice it.
25356	i absolutely love this bra.  there is zero show through, and it fits seamlessly.  wear the nude color under your tightest white top and you still won't see the bra or what's beneath it.  it's padded for support, not for size (at least on the larger cup sizes).  support is unparalleled, and it's very comfortable.  it's by far the best bra i own.the best part is that it comes in a wide variety of cup sizes, many of which you (unfortunately) won't find through victoria's secret or other common retailers.  very highly reccomended!
25429	sending it back.  getting a refund which is a plus.  a little small for me.  i kept losing things out of it such as money.
25464	met all my expectations in style and fit. the sizing chart is exact so no worries when ordering on line.
25470	i have not worn this style of boat shoe since 1989 thru 1991 when i owned both colors at that time, as soon as i opened the box from amazon i fell in love once again, i see people here complaining about a few things but i dont see one problem whatsoevet, so what if it is not made in the u.s, and big deal if it is not a vibram sole no more, that dont mean nothing, aint nobody in the street going to notice any of that nonsense, some people just complain about everything, and then all of a sudden they stop you from buying an item, the shoe met all od my expectations, it is a timeless classic that never goes out of style!
25533	i first saw this shoe in the store while looking for something to wear to work. it is impressive in it's support of the foot but also in comfort. those two don't often go together. with slacks, this shoe looks sleek and neat-almost like a boot.i like the soft collar around the opening; it makes the shoe really easy to put on and keeps it in place as well. they are strong but not stiff. good arch support and plenty of room in the toe box. especially good for cold weather. the sole has good tread so i feel safe in rain or even when it's icy. i wear these for dress wear with black slacks and can go anywhere.
25588	i recently got my first pair of birkenstocks with the soft footbed. previously, i only had the original footbed and broke the original in quickly, with no pain at all. i have plantar fasciitis and was excited to try the softbed out and break them in. i had actually gotten sized in a store to ensure the right fit and the softbed was highly encouraged by the salespeople.i know many people love the softbed and i don't know what the problem is for me. i have been wearing them for a few weeks now and they are painful (right where the plantars is). they are the right size. i obviously can't return them but i will be ordering another pair with the original footbed. the price was right for these however.by the way, i know many people dislike betula by birkenstock since they don't use real leather and are supposedly lower end, but i never had a problem with them. they lasted 8 years with no re-soling. i bought them by accident since i wanted a second pair of bostons and i thought they were the same. no pain at all with my plantars and quick break in period. in fact, they were exactly like the regular footbed boston birkenstock and i couldn't tell the difference when wearing them or my bostons.i will update my review in a few months to see if they will break in more and give me the comfort i have come to expect from birkenstock.
25635	smartwool is great.  these pair are thick on the bottom and dressier thin everywhere else.  perfect for wearing with khakis
25690	these sweatpants were not exactly what i was looking for, but i am not displeased with them either. they are lighter than i thought & i like a thicker elastic band. overall, i am happy with them though
25745	this boots are beautiful, comfortable and very stylish ! they are so good that i bought another one as a gift to a friend!
25780	very attractive watch.  basic features but that's about all you'd want in a dress watch.  face is dark blue.  easy to adjust the date, but adjusting the watchband length was not particularly easy, even having worked on my other 5 casio metal banded watches.  youtube videos were some help but the link locks were just difficult to remove for some reason.  still 5 stars because it is a very nice looking watch.  10 year battery ought to have it running down about the time i decide to buy another.
25785	not as good as i thought it would be, it was expensive but had none of the options that i thought were advertized.
25806	the band is very short. it is probably ok for kids or women, but a guy will have difficulty even putting the watch on. i say this as a guy with fairly thin wrists too. i was also dismayed to find that it does not display the month, only the day. typically not an issue, but still, cheesy.
25820	it is impossible to pull the band back to get the peg out and take the watch off. i think the band will be gone in a few months because of how hard i have to pull to get it off. also, the &#34;night light&#34; is terrible and doesn't illuminate well at all. and the main ink display isn't dark enough. sometimes i have to squint in broad daylight to see the timetwo stars for being nonetheless inexpensive and disposable.
25967	far and away one of the best digital watches on the planet.the casio 5600e is 30% lighter than its predecessor the 5600cand therefore feels more comfortable on the wrist, although not ascollectable. also the 5600c featured dual time.however, the styling was left unchanged, except for some very minorcosmetic changes with the writing on the face.you cannot perfect what is already perfected.the comfort is simply amazing for a what appears to be a bulky watch.the g shock has internal dampners installed to provide outstandingshock resistance, including full contact sports, chainsaws, jackhammers, etc, 12 rounds with mike tyson and full cage fighting :-)not to mention skydiving, space missions and scuba diving.features: classic casio 1980's looks, which many people love.24 hour stopwatch, but...the time is kept displayed, very useful.24 hour countdown timer, again, with the current time displayed.backlight, which flashes for the duration of the alarm and hourly time chime & timer.one alarm, not 3 0r 5 0r 19, as some people are annoyed by this, which i find kinda interesting.extremely comfortable resin band.and of course the illuminator...bring it on.i could go on all day and night about this watch, or perhaps write a novella on it, or evenbase my whole life memoirs, that is how much i love this watch, but i won't, for fears of repercussionsfrom my wife, my boss, my friends, and maybe even casio themselves.
25990	classic g with the rectangular face. very retro. this watch tells time and it's tough. good first watch for a kid or to use as a disposable travel watch.  wear it to the beach, to the pool or out on a tough-mudder run.  if it lasts, you'll know what time it is.  if it breaks (and it probably won't) get a new one.  can't go wrong.
26058	i've bought and had several watched but this one ads nice function and style. its a little bit weird how the strap won't fold flat but the watch is amazing. ok so temperature seems a little off but i cant be for sure because i don't have a thermometer just a thermostat. world time zones works great for me and the text can be difficult to read but it works fine for me. the auto illuminator is a nice feature as well. be sure to buy a watch link remover to size it just right for yourself.
26088	i was so dissappointed to see how cheap this watch looks after it arrived. i have worn it only once and will probably give it away. if you do not adjust the band to fit the watch will spin around your wrist as the watch itself is top heavy. the watch stem looked tarnished when it arrived and the band is very dull.  i have seen $10 watches at wal mart that are better looking.
26199	when i was looking for a watch i figured i'd spend the usual forty or fifty bucks for a so/so watch..but.. i spied this one and wondered if, at that price, it would be worth checking out.  i liked the looks etc. but couldn't help wondering if it was really a good watch?  i've now had it over a year and it keeps very good time.  i use the stop watch often and have no problems with it.  it still looks good, runs good and even the band seems to be of good quality.  (though it was a bit of a challenge trying to shorten it),  bottom line is... don't let the price fool you, this is a great deal!!!
26203	i have been having bad luck with certain casio watches.  this one broke after only a few months of use.  it broke right in the area where the watch band pins are inserted so now it is a pocket watch.  i have 3 other casio watches that broke in this same area.  it was also hard to get the analog time in sync with the digital time.  it might be a good casual watch for people if they are careful with it and the green color is pretty cool.
26204	what i love about this watch:1.  simple to set both analogue and digital time (don't believe the naysayers)2.  it is lightweight and the velcro strap fits your wrist perfectly3.  the hands, once charged in front of a lightbulb, luminate brighter than my timex4.  the night light works great and it actually helps charge the hands5.  the watch is waterproof so i won't have to take it off in the shower, washing the car etc6.  dial is easy to read7.  world time is handy, as i have relatives overseas in different countries8.  telememo for 30 phone numbers and it's a breeze to input the data9.  3 alarms and an hourly chime including snooze alarm10.  timer and stopwatch11.  the price and the lookso, i guess i love everything about this watch, i hardly notice i'm wearing itjust a perfect work watch, i should have bought this model years ago.
26243	i had been looking for a small faced, dressy (not-plastic-sports-style,) digital watch for months.  they are very hard to find!  this is exactly what i had in mind.  it is small, but easy to read. the case is thin and attractive, and the band is easy to adjust to fit perfectly.  the only concern i have is that the clasp can be knocked open if bumped against something. (i previously had a similar watch with a latch that folded out making a continuous loop so that it didn't fall off if accidentally opened. it saved the watch several times!)  i haven't tried the alarm feature yet - but i will soon be on after-school grandchild pick up duty and i know i will use the alarm often!
26372	when i was scrolling through the selection of watches, i came across this watch, and i liked it right off for its looks. even though it's a hybrid digital-analog model, it retains a classic, retro kind of look. i think it looks good. and certainly the price is right. but when it came i was dismayed. it is very plastic. it weighs less than a thumbtack! i wouldn't say it feels chintzy. but it doesn't have the weight that really good watches have. but rather than write it off, i read its thick little manual booklet, familiarized myself with all of its functions, and started wearing it. it is actually a quite versatile and functional timepiece. and it's the first watch i've ever come across that does not have a tiny knob to set the hands with. i didn't spot that anomaly until i received it. you push a combination of buttons to set the hour and minute hands. and, surprisingly, the setting and menu system is straightforward and intuitive. it has turned out to be an inexpensive tool i can really put to practical use. countdown timer. stopwatch. world clock. alarm clock. 12- or 24-hour display. illuminated dial. no great loss if it's lost or stolen. and it does look good, i think, if you can get past the fact that it's about 95 percent plastic. once i got used to its featherweight nature, i didn't regret buying it. i wear it on rough assignments. it's holding up well. in all honesty, i think this watch actually may be the best cheap, plastic watch i've ever owned! really! and so i recommend it. it's certainly nicer, more useful, and easy to figure out than most of the other cheap watches out there. your mileage may vary, but this watch by casio is doing right by me.
26395	"girls will ask you why your watch has a ""keyboard"" on it, a perfect conversation starter where you can begin to correct them that this is indeed a genuine calculator watch. my girl actually hates this watch but i love showing it off when it's time to calculate exactly 15% for my tip at the restaurant. i figure it will easily pay for itself after the couple of meals i would have over-tipped had i not had this exceptional timepiece. true, it has no backlight, but how often do you really check the time in a cave? it is water resistant enough to keep out sweat and sink water from hand washing (if you're into that sort of thing). it has dual time and an alarm but i never use those functions. i synced it with my dw-5600e g shock that keeps perfect time and after 3-4 weeks this calculator watch is running about 5 seconds slower, which is common for this watch and not too bad as far as accuracy goes. the only real con is since i started wearing it people keep asking if i can fix their computer? weird. otherwise i think it's a nice classic watch for the price."
26425	i purchased this product based on the image shown...i found the quality is compromised and for the same price, a better watch can be purchased....
26489	"i really like these pants. they do come in long, at least for someone 5'4"" and cuttin the bottom has worked out so far. i would recommend these pants, especially for the money."
26493	grandson is 15 months old.  daughter was very pleased with the structure and quality of shoe.  not wearing much, but he as room for growth.  all in all, we are very pleased with the shoe.  it's hard to fine shoes for little boys, that have great quality, great price and durable, especially for busy little boys.
26534	my husband has been wanting an eco drive watch for some time.  so, i decided valetine's day was a good time to do that.  he has quite a collection of watches already, and we have to spend too much money on batteries for them, so he wanted one that didn't require a battery, or movement, to keep it running.this watch is stylish and keeps great time.  a little while in the light (i think it's 45 minutes, but don't quote me on that) and it will keep a charge for up to 6 months, which is important for someone who might go that long in between watch wears because they have a few to choose from.although, since it is such a nice watch, he wears it most of the time, now.
26638	i bought this for my 10 year old son as a backpack for school.  the only thing he keeps in his backpack is a small 3 ring binder and occasionally he'll shove his sweatshirt in it.  there are 2 zippers on the big main pocket and within the first 3 weeks of school the zipper broke.  i don't have much use for a backpack that won't close.  won't be buying another k-cliffs backpack.
26715	i really do like these jeans (pants really)they fit perfect and the leg pocket is the perfect size for my blackberry.for the money you cant go wrong.
26733	as so many others have said here, these are a little big. not so much in overall size, but in torso length. because of this i selected large instead of xl, and it fits fine. another positive is the sleeves are slightly longer than normal, which is great. better to have the sleeves bunch a teeny bit, than have them too short. i'm a little bit of a knuckle dragger, so the sleeve length is perfect. stitching and material are high quality. you won't be disappointed.
26741	this garter and long is sweet and delectable.. ilove the fact that i can wear it with multiple teddys...  my boyfriend thought it was hot..i was even ablt to attach knee high socks to the garter....delicious.....
26781	i was actually very surprised with the two of these i ordered. very good strong thread and is good for many things including a tournoquet. i probably spelled that wrong but oh well you get the point. works great in hot weather as well or windy days here in the desert.
26863	let me preface my comments by saying at no time in the description did the seller state the earmuffs were adjustable.  and that is the problem.the ear pieces are super nice and warm, but the headband is not adjustable.  i am a small lady, and would like to adjust the head band so the muffs fit over my ears comfortably, but there is no way to do this.  the muffs were nice because there is a fabric cover for the plastic head piece.  but one size does not fit all, and it would have made the muffs feel ever so much better.  i would have even been glad to pay the extra few dollars for this feature.i can't attest to the warmth of the muffs because we've hit that january spell in tennessee where we've had to turn on the a/c to keep comfortable.  i expect that will not last, and i'll be able to report back about the warmth of the fur.
26864	although i bought these as a gift, i love these boots. they are well made and very cozy. i buy them for all friends as baby shower gifts. you cannot go wrong with robeez as first shoes.
26867	my granddaughter will wear without a fuss.  very cute and cozy.  the soles get dirty becasue she wears them out and they are suede but i eventually threw them in the wash a few times, they are fine.
26875	you get what you paid for.  i wanted a couple of light sabers to duel with so i ordered two.  i was disappointed with their cheapness but for $10 i can't expect it to be too sturdy.  my husband ended up getting me a couple of new sabers that were 3 times as expensive but are so much better.  now i'm not too worried about dueling with these and having them break but don't order this if you're wanting a durable product.  you might as well shell out the money for a better product.
27029	"i have a couple of slim jeans, but unfortunately i will not classify this as slim. i am 1.78m and 70kg. the w32l32 fits well on the waist and the length is also perfect.the colour of the jeans (overhaul) does seem to be slightly different from the pictures, but not a big deal. i like the subtle fade without being too ""loud"". unfortunately, the fit of the jeans is not really that slim for a slim guy like me. crotch area is pretty tight but from the thigh area all the way down to the calf area, the jeans is pretty much ""normal straight"" to me, much like regular 501s. the ends of the jeans also seem to flare out instead of crumpling neatly into a pile, making the jeans look somewhat ""bootcut"".if you are a person with thicker legs who wants to try going ""slim"", this is probably a good cutting to try out, i guess.however if you are a really slim guy looking for a pair of slim jeans which fits closely to your legs, you may feel slightly disappointed. try the 511s instead."
27035	these jeans feel like they're made from paper.  also, because i thought they would shrink if i washed them in my washing machine, i used dryel.  but they still shrank!
27106	i have owned three of these bras; just bought one in black again recently.  my advice on this one is if you are full in the cup, as in a full b, order a c cup.  the band size is fine.  just beware of the small-ish cups.  otherwise, nice bra:  5 stars for comfort.  the shaping is ok, but not as flattering as other bras in this category (underwired, stretch foam, molded/contour cup).  it kind of spreads them out rather than lifts them, but great for an everyday bra and if you want a natural look.
27124	the material is soft and the bra it self is lovely.  anyone buying this should get a size larger.  needed to get a 38-d.
27127	it is my favorite bra.  more than ten years using this brand and this style and i have never been disappointed.  i loved it!
27150	have found that the barely there line of intimates does perform as advertised.  this bra serves me well under knits and almost every blouse and sweater i own.
27158	for one size, it does not really fit on someone like me though i fall in the category well. the thigh highs are too tight on top, and the top comes down too  low, so the garters are too long.  this would be good on a woman who is 5'10&#34; & up weighing 125 lbs.  waste of my money!:-(
27168	i am around 5'1 and 150. ok. honestly, 155. i buy stockings because they usually make me feel sexy. they hide bumps and show off my better features.regarding these stockings:pros:the pattern on this is beautiful.it is fairly durable for a stocking.price was decentlooks great on the model.cons:its to loose in the back (probably because i'm short)its to tight around my thighs (probably because i'm fat)it shows off my cellulite. (which i already pointed out is usually hidden by this kind of clothing)and downplays any pleasant curve i have. (i feel blah in it.)overall, i'm disappointed. i will try to dress it up a bit. maybe slip it under a dress (i love the pattern), but i doubt that i will ever like it much. even if hubby does.--- note: at the suggestion of another reviewer, i tried it on backwards. it looks much better. specifically with a bra. almost like a corset, but not. i think i can wear it this way with a vest or jacket and a short skirt. --- much happier.
27302	really, imeant it. this is the best wallet i've ever owned. i ordered the red one and the color is beautiful, the leather is soft but durable and it's not designed like any wallet i've ever bought. i looked at  so many styles, prices and  but i kept going back to this one. the versatility of this one is beat out all the rest.i will order this one again ( in 10 years ). this wallet will last this long because of the quality  in it.  please muundi, do not ever stop producing this wallet.this would be a gift for any woman to cherish for years, i will be giving this to the women in my life. there many beautiful colors to choose from. the features in this wallet are many but my favorite one is the separate zippered compartment for money. i appreciate not having to open the entire wallet to get cash.buy this you will love it.
27324	this wallet is everything it is advertised to be, and more. the workmanship is great, the leather is nice and not too thin, and it definitely has plenty of room and slots to hold much more than just your spare change!the best part, though, has got to be the price! it is incredible to be able to purchase a leather wallet of this quality at this price. even if it only lasts me a year, it will certainly be worth it's cost to me (i've owned leather wallets that have only lasted that long and they were 4 times more expensive than this one).the wallet is definitely big, as its name implies. fortunately, with the large handbags now in vogue, this will not be a problem for most women! i plan on purchasing several more as gifts. just a great product, all around!
27359	purchased this watch as a gift for my girlfriend... very impressed with it so far. she showers, swims and wears it all day without it missing a second. nice color on it as well.
27364	it's a very good quality and i have received several compliments.  i am anally fussy, and was not disappointed one bit.  i got it for my trip to puerto rico because i was going to do snorkeling.  i hope you enjoy it as much as i do.  oh, and it works great around and under water too!
27399	a nice looking watch except for the fact that the writing at the bottom of the face is crooked, which spoils the appearance and it's hard to set because there's not enough friction in the stem. the slightest movement while holding the watch with the stem pulled out causes the minute hand to move making it hard to get it aligned with the minute marker. plus, for a quartz watch, it slows down about a minute a week.i'm thinking it is either defective or they are selling factory seconds.
27426	"ok, folks...both guys and gals who garden do barn chores or are just in and out of town on errands(well, maybe not your town, but ours here in maine are pretty informal)these are the most comfy garden clogs ever.  this is my second pair and we just received a pair for my husband as well.  my old ones i literally wore to ""smooth bottoms"".one thing, though, they do run small, so order up a half size at least.(my husband ordered a men's size 12 which fits his 11 shoe size foot perfectly.  i ordered women's 9 and wear size 8 or 8.5 shoes)they're made in the usa....what more could you ask for?"
27451	what i was looking for was a hat that looked good and would afford protection from the sun when doing outside home projects or hiking.  liked this one so much i ordered another.
27464	just what i wanted...... a comfortable, all  cotton tee.it seems that they are few & far between these days.the raspberry is a pretty color .
27467	i'm always a medium and ordered the large.  they fit perfect across chest and shoulders.  it's too long and will have to be hemmed but that's the case with every shirt i buy, even with a medium.  nice little scoop to go with anything.
27478	very comfortable t-shirt.  long length is great to wear under other t-shirts.  washes great, no shrinking in the dryer.  soft, cotton.  highly recommend!
27549	i was very excited to buy these.... i pretty much wear crocs or uggs. my friend has a pair and loves them.i am on my feet most of the day and up and down stairs.these run very narrow and a really heavy.i am trying to give these a fair amount of time to see if they work out.order a size up as they run small.
27559	i am furious!! i can't even get a hold of a live person to take care of this matter! i am totally pist off. i am so tired of being ripped off! i want my money credited back to my account. i did what i was supposed to do, now it's your turn!!
27575	i have very wide feet and wasn't sure about the length and width of these shoes.  i ordered my size and a size bigger and to my surprise my size was roomy enough.  my heels cover the trim a little but the trim crushes down and it isn't a bother to walk on.  after wearing them twice i've noticed they have given already so that's even better.  i chose chestnut because i thought they would be more practical and the color is beautiful.  i gave it three stars because i think the fur trim is too fluffy and the weight of the shoe makes them a little difficult to keep on while walking.  i don't hate the trim but i'm glad that most of my pants cover that part and i think thicker socks could solve the sliding problem.  overall, they're nice looking, warm and will help me get through the rest of my pregnancy without having to put big boots on my swollen feet this winter.update: i wore these shoes for one winter season and ended up getting rid of them. they gave so much in width that the only way they would stay on my feet was if i walked like a snail.  my ankle turned a few times, once resulting in a pretty bad fall.  wearing them without socks helped to prevent the shoe from sliding off a little but not much.  if you size down, they'll be too short so i think that either way, these shoes just stretch out way too much.  they were cute and i received many compliments but very heavy and clunky.  i believe the sole is just too much.  i had to get rid of them because they were hazardous to my health.
27577	i usually take a 7. these are so huge. i've ordered 2 pair (1/2 and whole size) smaller, hoping they arrive in time for my trip. i wonder if this is true of all sketchers, as i see other styles i'd like. these look good, and i think they will be both versatile and comfy, hence the 3 stars. but if i cannot wear them, they're not getting more stars.so here i am, back weeks later, to say that the full size down was the pair that worked out for me. but they were fantastic on the trip, which involved a lot of walking on uneven terrain and cobbled streets! i have added another star,but not to five, so others will pay attention to the size difficulty.
27587	"this is my 3rd pair of skechers sandals.  the first pair disappeared with my lost luggage on a trip to italy last year.  i was so upset, since they were my favorite ""casual"" shoes.  the 2nd pair i still use; but they are size 7 1/2 and just a bit too short for my toes (the original pair were open-toed).  i only use them now when i am kayaking, since i don't mind if they get wet.  for the latest pair, i went up a 1/2 size and the fit is perfect.  they have great arch support, which is important to me since i've had plantar faciitis in the past.  they are also very comfortable - i usually wear them on my days off when i'm running around.  i've worn them with jeans, capris and even skirts, and i've gotten alot of compliments on them.  i live in florida, and find that they are much cooler than a sneaker; in fact, i think the skecher sandals are even more comfortable than their sneakers.  i would definitely recommend them."
27602	[---quick summation on quality in general---]leather is noticeably soft without the plastic feel of the usual sub 200$ departmental dress shoes (boston, johnston and murphy etc.). the leather sole is stiff and rigid and they are meant to conform to your foot over time so there may or may not be a break-in period however, you will have to let them get acquainted with your foot.these can be shined which hold superior gloss versus many of the other less expensive brands. moreover, you buy these shoes to stay with you a long time as they can be re-crafted (new sole, and tightens the leather a bit) for a little above 100$ which will turn them into a somewhat new pair of allen edmonds shoe that is already somewhat molded with your foot.quality: 9/10-------------------------------------------------------------[---issues---]it took me (2) returns: 1 from amazon and 1 directly from allen edmonds to force my hand in putting 2 stars for an allen edmond shoe. this being said, i will still buy their shoes for the hope that this one--flagship and iconical line--is an anomaly.my current shoe closet has many pairs of allen edmonds shoes e.g. strand, lasalle, neumora. with experience in 1st quality and 2nd quality, nothing has been less than expected from a 'superior line' when examining the quality of the shoe (with the exception of subjective observations). the park avenue, the staple of allen edmonds shoes, has been the pariah where these were supposed to be the foundation.1st pair:as noted by many people over the internet, with the park avenues seemingly being the only 'violater', there is 'bowing' i.e. top-line bulge at the mouth of the shoe. explained more, the part surrounding your ankle has too much 'excess' of leather i.e. seemingly not made proportionally so that the sides bulge from excess material. the latter allows much creasing on the sides so that it looks like your ankle is a...chicken ankle (think of pants that are too big 'creasing' at the waist when a belt is cinched).my first pair from amazon had this problem along with unsightly 'creasing' at the mouth from excess leather. needless to say, it was not a good looking shoe. in general, i can make compromises with other, less expensive, pairs of shoes however, when i make the conscious choice to purchase quality shoes i expect nothing less than perfection (at least enough perfection by eyeing it). when you choose to spend more for a luxury car or watch, you may be overspending however one thing will not be a question: the quality is above average and it will work as intended; nothing more.from the latter problems i returned them based on the bowing.2nd pair:the first shoe looked as it should and there was minimal bowing, see normal. the next shoe (right pair) had a flopping right side on the mouth (top-line bulge...again). this was confirmed when i put my foot inside. it was so bad i could stick 2-3 fingers, one on top of the other, inside the 'space' made by the too big leather. it looked very, very bad.*it should be noted that i can be so adament about the lack of 'tightness' around the mouth because of my experience with previous allen edmonds shoes...and dress shoes in general (from various manufacturers). the sizing is not the issue.*knowing amazon does not allow returns after the 1st (rightfully so as they, at that point, figure it is an issue with the product in general), i contacted customer service and explained the situation. they thus investigated their current stock for the problem.meanwhile i contact allen edmonds directly where i was met with the much documented good customer service where i was told to send them back even though i purchased them from an online retailer with the explanation of the problem.3rd pair:receiving them fairly quickly after i sent them, everything on the shoe looked good...finally...until i examined a little more in detail. as i am not necessarily a 'finicky' or judging person (not too harshly) where i would forgive scrapes, scratches, creases (before i wear them), or smudges, the next problem is unacceptable for a the type of shoe manufacturer allen edmonds represents.*crooked toe cap*as i said previously that everything on the 3rd pair looked fine (top line bulge was non existent and tight), there was a new problem--the toe cap. where it is supposed to be straight across--180 degrees--the shoe, it was more like 165. instead of a plane, it was a slope. the right shoe was more apparent than the left, however they would be 'straight' if i walked with my toes outward (pretty good if i was trying out a charlie chaplin act..though for normal use, pretty tough).at this point, i am getting slightly impatient with constantly exchanging shoes however the problems are so that i cannot accept a subpar pair from a manufacturer that you pay for having 'pristine' quality.these have all been 1st quality for the record. even the seconds i purchased were obviously better 'put together' than this 'lucky' group of three.even with the issues, i intend to exchange them until i get a pair that is satisfactory. if this begins to be the norm rather than the exception, and other lines are affected as well, then i will start to question what direction allen edmonds, as a company, is wanting to go.[---9/4/2013 addendum---]4th pair:exchanged the 3rd pair (the exchange directly from allen edmonds with the toe-cap crooked problem) with amazon and the new pair has none of the above noted problems. no bowing and no crooked toe cap.not sure what would cause these 'quality control' problems as the pairs that i received would be fairly ok as seconds even though the bowing really adjusts the look of the shoe. the cost of replacing this many times and at the risk of allen edmond's customer base changing their opinion somewhat of the companies' philosophy and quality would certainly not be worth having to go over a shoe for its proper production.4th time should not be a charm in this case; not with the price and reputation that is behind this shoe.
27604	a heavy, seemingly well made shoe.  i have enjoyed them, but disappointed that the top metal shoe lace eyelet fell off in the first few weeks.
27608	good fit good everything except maybe not as good as the gucci loafers and church's?needs to concentrate on fitting if it wants to be a legend.
27619	i have been searching for the right size bra for myself because i had gotten breast enhancement surgery a while back. i saw this bra and thought it would be perfect because in the picture it doesnt look as if it is complete coverage and cute enough to wear out. wrong. this bra (in a 34 g) is full coverage. im taking even when i wear a tank top (thick strapped) it is sticking out over my shirt. keep in mind that i dont dress trampy in anyway at all. there is o way i can wear this bra out and can only wear it to work when i have a shirt that goes all the way up to my neck.. v necks, forget about it. i am so disappointed. very very bad purchase.
27634	this is by far the best bra i have ever owned. i know it's pricey but believe me you get what you pay for. i am a 36 ddd, and have never found a bra that was comfortable. i always thought i needed a bra with thick straps to comfortable but when it fits properly around your torso, it doesn't put the same pressure on your shoulders. buy one now. you will not regret it.
27740	i love the color, the way it fits and looks.  it is perfect for me because i swim every day and go snorkeling several times a year.
27771	these are well-made and good quality. i got the sizing wrong so had to return them and the size neede was no longer in stock, but will buy again if they come back in the right size.
27773	like the closed bottom, expandable waist, and the light grey color. lightweight and fit as requested is very satisfactory and as requested.
27789	these sweats are great. they are nice and soft. these are not lightweight sweats. they are so comfortable! i own several pair in various colors and wear them constantly as they are great for casual wear. the drawstring is designed in such a way that it will not get lost. they have a closed, elastic bottom. the waist, of course, is also elastic. these sweatpants are a good buy.
27796	"so i ordered these in hopes of getting some good around the house sweat pants, theyre sized closer to 2 sizes smaller then on the label when compared to unbranded or hanes products of the same size.so being an amazon prime customer i was easily able to return them, but they charged half the price of a pair of the pants as a ""restock"" fee, i dont know if they do this for every order returned or just me, because i had to remove the pants from the plastic bag to try them on.needless to say i will not attempt to get a larger size of these pants from them since if they dont fit right i will be eating most of the cost in return fees."
27896	my 4 year old specifically asked for a jewelry box for her birthday and i bought her this one.  she loves it.  it's just a simple, nicely decorated music box and worth what i paid for it.  seems durable enough but will not hold a lot of items but it holds enough to suit her.
27903	i've had one pair of these shoes for several years now (bison color full leather) - the inside heel counter needs to be relined, but even the sole doesn't show much wear. my feet are hard to fit - but the eur 46 size is a brilliant and comfortable fit (i replaced the original insole with superfeet green, as i have plantar fasciitis - no more pain!) and a fantastically comfortable walk; they are rugged but relatively lightweight for such a build. especially when traveling, i walk these shoes 4 - 6 miles a day, pavement, cobblestone, etc. and have taken them all over the world. the goretex keeps my feet dry if it rains, the soles cushion one's step well, the leather holds up and holds up (i give them a polish with two layers, and with a month of travel just need to use a shoe cloth to take the dust off and bring back the polish) for street, moderate trail or city use. european craftsmanship is is reflected throughout in the fine build and fit.(i am writing the review because i just ordered a new pair so i can wear them while my older ones get the heel cup relined). as in all shoes, get measured properly and order the size you need - if you don't know you may as well go and get your feet measured.
27907	i thought these shoes looked cuter on the website, but after receiving them, i find they look almost clownishly big for my taste.good for people with really wide feet, they are comfortable, but left too much room for my feet, and made me feel kind of like a duck, waddling in them, instead of walking in them.i will have to return these as i will probably never wear them for anything.
27941	i liked this shoe, but i had to return it for a fit problem.  the overall fit was just fine, correct to size, but the collar on the right shoe rubbed my ankle bone uncomfortably.  i own several hiking shoes but i've never had that problem before.  if not for that i'd have kept them although they really do have a wide toe box making your foot look broad.  i liked the color - a chocolate brown, darker than the photo, but certainly not black.  i really appreciate that amazon provided free shipping and a free return.  just go online and click return, print out the ups label and drop it off at a ups store.
27944	i love my keen's sandals but can't quite wear them in winter, so i ordered the presidio shoe based on the reviews. they went back almost right away...they seriously hurt my feet! i wore them around the house for a little while but found them rubbing my left foot just below the ankle, and they had too much support for the metatarsal area. way too stiff with a very hard insole. my feet were aching badly. it felt like i'd been wearing those dr. school's wooden clog/sandals we all used to wear in the 1970s!!i swapped out the insole with a gel insole to get some cushioning, and that didn't help. then i ordered the powerstep inserts that i have used in less supportive sneakers, and they did not work at all. four different insoles and my feet ached every time.if you don't have problem feet, these may be fine for you, but if you need firm but gentle support, i wouldn't recommend them. my clark's mules and clogs are considerably more comfortable and supportive.
28008	holds too big books and my 15 inch laptop too with comfort  and ease.  easy to reach for everything inside and lots of storage inside and out.
28036	i've had my bag for about two years and one of the shoulder straps started to come apart at the seams. i went to high sierra's website and filled out an rma request. they got back to me within a day and had me destroy the bag and email them a few pictures of the destroyed bag and the tag (which i kept specifically for the warranty). they sent out a new bag via fedex and it arrived later in the week. the whole process from reporting the problem to receipt of new bag took 5 days.
28069	haven't had enough time with this yet, sorry to be iffy but i really wanna see where this bag goes, ya know . . .
28075	for the price i was worried.. this backpack is great. i have a boy about to be a freshman and i am more then certain there is enough room for all this homework, and personal things, and even a spot for his ipod so its not tossed into the bottom of the bag!! may be to big for grade school, but middle school and up yes yes yes!!
28120	the style and function is great, but during the first week of use the zipper pulls started fraying.  ended up cutting them off the zippers because they kept getting stuck in the zipper. not a huge deal.  but now you have less to grab to zip it up.  the back pack is large.  i compared size when shopping and this is one of the largest that is still meant for school and not camping or hiking.
28122	missing eyeglass case like in picture.  missing waist belt.  not exactly like the second picture. .  if you do not need it, ok backpack.
28129	we bought a black/charcoal high sierra loop backpack. love the color.our primary objective of getting this backpack is to be used as a backpack while we are travelling from one country to another. the main features we are looking for:- multiple compartments (yes)- side pocket for water bottle (yes)- key ring holder (yes)- padded section for ipad (no, partly our fault for not reading the description)- comfortable straps (yes)- bottom part of the bag is made of one thin layer of material (rather disappointed)
28137	purchased this bag because the one i had has seen better days. took it to nyc this weekend and walked around all day with it pretty much full. it is very comfortable to wear and made of light, yet tough materials. the strap successfully transfers the weight from the lower part of the bag (my back) to my shoulders. it has plenty of padding and was very easy to wear. it is easily adjustable to suit. after wearing it all day my shoulders were a little sore but that's not because of the bag. if anything it helped spare my back and legs. being on your feet for 12+ hours walking around will make anyone's back sore.the bag has plenty of space to store all your items. an excellent day trip/overnight bag. it will also be very nice for hiking. excellent areas inside the bag to store all your stuff and/or keep it separated. it seems to be well built. not the most heavily constructed bag. for one of those you will need to purchase a $100+ trekking bag. but this will suit me just fine. i can use it for many purposes. can't beat the price/quality and i am very happy with my purchase!
28223	. . . the answer is 'to tree'!if you purchase good quality shoes then using shoe trees should be a priority. even bargain shoes will look better if you use shoe trees. they keep the shape of the shoe intact while the cedar wicks out the moisture that is left in the shoes after you have worn them. the allen edmonds cedar shoe trees have always been an excellent quality item. i use them for my mezlan redford dress shoes, mezlan carmichael oxfords, mezlan spyder slip-ons and hummer sneakers, as well as, mybite golf shoesto name just a few. the a-e shoe trees are all great. much better than using the plastic handle/wooden shoe trees. i bought a pair from a chain store for my sneakers and after using them twice the handle broke off. that will not happen with these. try them. you'll see the difference using these shoe trees makes. ~ the boss
28232	although there is no discount in the price, this is a great product especially for the allen edmond's shoes, fitted beautifully.  we recommend you go to the allen edmond's website as they have a much better shoe size grid for you to determine which size to buy.  perfect fit on first purchase and we'll probably get more.  made of cedar, very well made and smelled nice out of the box!
28249	i use this as a diaper bag. we cloth diaper and the extra space is excellent for fitting a lot of cloth diapers and the extra compartments are great for cloth wipes and extras!
28285	my daughter has wanted these for awhile and i know she hikes and takes on mountains.  fit is comfortable and sturdy.  looking forward to reviews when they are taken out for a spin.  keens are always a good call!
28298	i have lots of keen shoes but these just did not work for me. they were too big and not technical enough. with that said, if you are looking for an &#34;around town&#34; hiking boot and they happen to fit your particular foot well, then go for it. as i said, i have lots of keen shoes, i plan to buy more in the future but these just were not what i was looking for.
28345	"buit they fit perfectly.  the 1/2""(12mm) are just a tad too big, these are just the right size.  i gave this item 5 stars because of price, the excellent shipping, i ordered them on a friday morning, they arrived monday.they are a bit of a struggle to get in but once in, they stay in."
28354	i have narrow boney feet and a heel spur, so pretty much all dress shoes that don't have cushion will hurt my feet after a short time.  i buy these by the dozen and literally have them in all my dress shoes.  they are perfect for high heels as they provide cushy support and keep your feel from sliding forward and take up very little room.  i use them in sandals as they don't show either in open toe shoes.the material is very high quality, i've had them in some of my favorite shoes, been in them for close to 10 years and still works.  the material is also not sticky like some of the gel insoles, so they don't feel sticky to your bare feet.
28362	they really do help the shoe become more comfortable.  i bought them because my foot tends to slip a little in my platform heels.  with these, problem solved!
28460	this device seemed pretty easy to use, but the first time i tried to use it the plastic snapped, rendering it useless. i'd seen mixed reviews on this so i also ordered a different watch sizing kit - thank goodness. this thing was a waste of money.
28528	"just to be clear, i got this tool when it was priced at $5.95.  for that price, it's a no-frills solution to removing watch backs with the ""slots."" i had no problem getting it to work on a couple of different brands (swiss army, fossil), but i did not try it on my higher-end watches since i am more comfortable letting the jeweler deal with those. the watches i used it on were ones that [...] and [...] had already refused to do, so this $5 purchase kept me from having to invest the $17 the watch repair shop typically charges for a simple battery replacement.note:  this item comes in a wooden box with all parts but no instructions on use.  there was a sticker on the box telling me to go to [...] if i needed help on how to use the tool.  that website has free instructions on removing watch backs in general, so you could go there to see if you can solve your problem without buying any tool."
28566	works as advertised. fixed our leather couch after i got out of the hot tub and forgot to put a towel behind my wet hair.
28569	i use this to touch up my old brown leather couch.  the application process takes some time in doing the multiple layers to keep things even and then you have to use a leather cleaner to remove the excess to prevent staining clothing but then it is there to last.
28755	these jeans fit me really well in the first few days of wear, but they stretch out a lot more than other jeans (i usually buy the 515, and they last way longer shape-wise in between washes).
28786	i ordered the brown slippers to fill my cart and get free shipping. the comfort of havaianas are a given, no complaints there but they were packed awkward and now the thong part flips under and rubs against the top of my foot...not cool. i'll have to take a hair dryer to it and try to straighten it out. gave it a 4, mostly due to amazon.com's part.
28831	these are perfect! the leg opening is tapered to the calf, but by the ankle the leg keeps straight. the result is a slimming, easy-to wear look. i wear them with boots or flats. the jean will stretch and shrink with wearing and washing, so i'd recommend ordering a size down (esp. if you don't wear junior's sizes). the color does stain a little, but mine stopped bleeding after 2 washes. i like levi's a lot and these jeans will last a long time.
28886	i don't know if my hose ripped because of something i did or the company itself but its very easy to rip. i think that may just be how pantyhose are in general. it's a good buy if you are looking to wear it only a few times.
28893	arrived quickly and fit well, we'll see if they hold up or if it's a one-use product.it is beyond me why more women don't wear thigh-hi's. it seems to me they are very practical in several ways, and they definitely look good. i hope the fashions go back to more legwear - bare legs are nice but stockings look very dressy and classy.
28903	"my favorite thigh highs ever were made by hanes--they came in an extraordinarily natural-on-me color called ""nude"", had a pretty lace top, lasted forever, felt great, and you could order them in medium, which would fit up to 6ft (not this a/b and c/d sizing).  these are definitely not as good, but i've been trying out different brands and styles like crazy, and so far the closest i've found to my old holy grail thigh highs.on colors: i've ordered these in jet, barely there, travel buff, and little color.  jet is a standard sheer black.  barely there looks god-awful on me--far too dark/orangey for my pale skin and reminiscent of your granny's knee-highs.  (obviously these might look beautiful on someone with darker skin; they just suck on me.)  but then travel buff is unnaturally light, even on someone as fair as i am.  it's not light enough to look white, but not dark enough to look natural, so it just ends up looking a bit unhealthy.  little color is currently my go-to natural color, although the ideal shade for me would be just a little lighter than this.on sizes: i've ordered these in both size a/b and c/d, and i can wear both, but neither is as perfect as the old medium.  the a/b fits nicely around, but doesn't come as high up on the thigh as i'd like.  i'm 5'11 and it only hits about halfway up on me.  i like them to come up higher because they feel more secure when they fit around the larger part of my thigh, plus you can wear them with shorter dresses/skirts, and they just look sexier, in my opinion.  so i started ordering c/d for the extra length.  the length on the c/d size is actually perfect, but i've noticed they tend to roll down a bit.  not enough to actually fall down or anything--it's just the very top that tends to fold over.  i'm guessing this is due to their being a bit too big around, as the a/b size doesn't do this for me.  (bring back medium!)these feel very nice--silky, not scratchy, and the lace top is much prettier than the non-lace kind.  the stay-up band is also nice and wide, which for me has been the secret to being able to comfortably keep them up all day.  unfortunately these are significantly less durable than the old kind--some pairs have lasted fine, but on others my toe has broken through on a first wear.  (but as others have pointed out, thigh highs are great because you can still use the good half of a pair when you get a snag.)overall i'd recommend these.  i'll keep looking for something better, but as i said, i've tried a lot and thus far these are the best i can find, at least in this price range."
29109	i owned these sneakers years ago, and have always described them as &#34;walking on clouds&#34;. recently, i needed a pair of sneakers for walking, and decided to see if they were still available~~~and, much to my surprise, they were! my original pair were men's, so i duplicated that purchase with these, and could not be more pleased with the comfort! i take a size 9 in women's, and the 8 in men's are a perfect fit and allow a little extra room!
29118	i have a wide foot, with a very narrow heel. wore rykas for years, but they've changed their shoes, so i'm now hunting (unsuccessfully) to find something to replace them. i was very disappointed that this shoe was not a good fit for me. it is extremely well made and there wasn't anything i didn't like about it. unfortunately, it was too wide in the heel and it slid up and down on my foot. if you have a &#34;normal&#34; foot, this would be a great shoe.
29122	i walk several miles most days, and these shoes are working out fine for me.  i've had them a couple of months, and they're holding up well so far.  they did need a breaking in period of a few days.  they're not the cutest shoes in the world (kind of clunky-looking) but they're supportive and my joints and heels don't hurt like they have when i've walked a lot in other shoes.  order a half size up.
29124	i'm 5'10&#34; tall and have a size 12 med. shoe, so finding a shoe in my size is difficult enough and i always have to buy online or by catalogue which can be literally a pain.  i also have had several stress fractures, broken ankles, plantar fasciitis & rheumatoid arthritis.  buying a comfortable sneaker/shoe that looks & feels good,doesn't make my feet look larger and is not $200 is a difficult task.  with that said &#34;bingo&#34; i would recommend this sneaker above any i have ever had, even new balance, reebok or nike.  what a comfortable, good looking, quality sneaker!!!  the price was definitely in my price range and saucony now has a devoted customer.
29197	i bought these shirts for my husband, and he loves them. he likes the material, and the beautiful way they are made, and he loves the beautiful birds on them. they are super great!
29218	during my wife's pregnancy, she was diagnosed not only with borderline pre-eclampsia but polyhydramnios (excessive amniotic fluid) as well.  both of these on top of a pregnancy made her very uncomfortable and she complained of aching all over.  i looked far and wide for anything to help relieve her pain during her pregnancy and stumbled across this item.  after reading about it, i decided ~$15 was a small price to pay to help alleviate her discomforts.after wearing it almost everyday for her pregnancy, she liked it but has mixed feelings.  she says it does help with her back and abdominal pain because it lifts her baby bump.  however, she says it only really helps when she's standing up.  when she sits down, the cradle band is uncomfortable to wear.  she claims not only does it come loose (requiring her to re-adjust it) when she sits down, but the material folds and puts pressure on her as well.  this is a catch-22 in her situation, as she was put on bedrest and was told not to be on her feet by her doctor due to the pre-eclamptic symptoms.i assume that had she not been borderline pre-eclamptic, this band would have been more enjoyable for her since she would have been on her feet a lot more.  regardless, it does work and $15 was a small price to pay.
29261	"these are a staple in my husband's closet. though i see several folks reporting inconsistent quality and sizing, the last 2 pair we purchased here (oct 2012) are just as durable and accurately sized as the first pair we purchased years ago. out of 8 pair he's owned, only one turned out to be a tad wonky. the reality is that any mass produced, foreign made garment in this price range risks some consistency issues, but there are no other jeans that fit his build better than the classic fit izod.he has both the darker vintage and the lighter blue and they're more than adequately soft without being too thin. they're machine washed in warm water on the most vigorous cycle and dried on the hottest setting but they hold up pretty nicely and haven't significantly shrunk. on a few pairs, he's experienced a belt loop breaking, but for a man who is rough on his clothes, we're impressed.the look of these is pretty, well, ""dad jeans"" as we call them. they won't win style points as the cut isn't on trend and they've not been given any additional vidual treatments like pre-fading. we overlook that as hubby has a hard-to-fit body so the generous stride makes these ideal for the long-waisted.due to the low price, comfort, and, in our experience, consistent fit, we hope they keep churning these out."
29267	i bought two pair. like shoes the lack of pants in my size at local stores e.g. target (there's two less than a mile apart and neither have 34/32!? maybe someone will discover inventory control and predict consumer buying...) so i am looking at amazon to buy pants.they are heavy which while they'll probably hold up pretty well over time are also a bit warm. i have a hard time dealing with the front pockets. i keep my keys and change, cigarette lighter in my front pockets and it always seems a tight fit getting my hand in them to fish out what i need. i don't have this problem with levis or wranglers.on the (new) pair i am wearing today there are loose string loops on the outer leg seams in more than one place. whether this is an issue of quality control or merely quality i don't know. the other pair does not have the same loose string problem.they are fairly comfortable but really that is often a factor of your body itself. not any more comfortable than levis to me though.the legs are longer than typical jeans of the same size. my 34/32s are more like a 34/33.if you never tried on a pair i might suggest trying them at a store first before buying online. i wish i could but see my opening thesis...
29354	"i use 8 or 8 1/2 sneakers, wide width. i always have problems with sneakers because i have very flat feet- no arches. i hated to buy sneakers because it takes me a looong time to find one i can be comfortable with. i end up with painful ankles, knees and back. i have to admit i am overweight: 5 ft tall, 175 lbs., which doesn't help. my friend recommended bloch women's dance sneaker. i was reluctant at first because i have been disappointed time and again, but i know i can't give up. she suggested to get a larger size (it was also recommended online at amazon). i don't find the price exorbitant because i have spent more than that looking for the right fit. i bought size 10.5 medium/average (bloch doesn't come in wide) and kept my fingers crossed. it was fantastic! i didn't feel pain after a rigorous exercise! i would definitely recommend the bloch sneakers to anyone! be sure to order the correct size- it may not be easy to do because each person's feet are shaped differently. i got lucky! maybe because i have wide feet and it's size 10.5, the shoes looked like a ""boat"" to me, but i didn't care- i'm after comfort. i'm debating buying another one to use outside, but my friend said it's strictly for dancing/exercise. the sneakers were delivered in good time and in good condition. i definitely recommend the bloch sneakers for price, quality and timely delivery."
29433	i have used hagerty polishing cloths for years. they are generous in size and they are good for both gold and silver.
29654	like other reviews mention it is not exactly as pictured in the image but my son still likes then because now his underwear is just like daddys! i think they seem a little long but otherwise fit and quality is great and hold up well when washed.
29657	a friend bought me a pair of sand-colored, regular-height uggs for my birthday last year, and i love them, especially in this nice fall weather.  they're so warm, soft and comfy ... perfect for tramping around the neighborhood, admiring the changing leaves and winter scenery.since i never tuck my jeans inside the boots, i saw this shorter length and decided they would be even more practical.  i was already sold on the comfort, so decided to go for variety of color.i chose distressed blue--perfect complement to jeans--and when i strolled over to the park, i was the envy of all my friends. i hope they make these in pink, like the regular height. i can't wait to get another pair.
29685	i have thicker thighs, i'm a size 9-11 in pants and i'm very curvy. these would've been cute. i can get them up but they cause that unflattering bulge at the top of the thigh and..yeah. not too happy. don't get these unless you're a smaller girl.
29694	im about 5'5 and 150lbs. this body stocking is too short for me!! the leg part fits well but its not long enough to cover my breasts! i guess thats no big deal since it wouldnt last long in that area anyway but still. im short and its not long enough. thats ridiculous! it was semi easy to put on. the material didn't rip when i was carefully!! pulling it up my legs. but thats the only good part about this product. 2 stars only because shipping was fast and material was soft. don't waste your money if your over 5 ft tall!
29715	we moved into a house with mostly wood floors, and in the winter, they get cold and regular socks just slip like crazy--and with a baby that i carry around all the time, slipping is not an option. i've tried many different type of grippy socks and slippers, and haven't loved any of them--the gripper dots usually come off within one or two washings or trips around the house. so when someone recommended these yoga socks, i had to give them a try.unfortunately, i don't really like them. the grippy knobs are nice--they've stayed on through a few washings already and they're small enough that you can't feel them when walking on them (a problem with some other grippy socks). but the actual toe part of the socks? egads. it's hard to get your toes in the holes and takes some finessing (something i don't feel you should have to do with something as basic as socks). then, once you have them on, the socks feel so thick they are almost uncomfortable (i now know i can't stand to have things between my toes).as far as sizing, i wear a 10-11 and i ordered the large and they fit just right. they do help with not slipping on the wood floors, but the irritation they cause when wearing them push them to the back of my drawer.
29738	love it. fits very very well and is as comfortable as underwire sports bras can be. wish it were a bit less expensive however, i guess you can't have it all.
29776	very nice shirts , soft and strong. not those crappy thin ones you get at walmart.i bought the black and white one and am going to order the blue one next.
29789	if i understand the dockers descriptions correctly d1 is tailored/slim fit, d3 are the relaxed fit and d2 are right in the middle.  i am of slim build so the smaller d1 size look better but i have trouble carrying my keys, wallet, and cellphone in the pockets.  d3 are a big baggy and are comfortable but look a little less professional.  i would recommend start with the d2 and go up or down depending on your level of comfort and desired style.
29839	i think i didn't buy it because i looked at the measurements and it's tiny. i need a big watch with big numbers because i can't see small things anymore. i am old.marci waters, oldster
29866	these are my first fingerless gloves.  i have some knit arm warmers which are okay but i didn't feel as if i had any grip on the steering wheel - thus the need for fingerless grippy gloves.  they are a bit bulky through the palms but it's not that big a deal, especially for the price.  i like the grippy things on the palm and i especially like not having to take off my gloves to use my iphone.  my hands and fingers are perfectly warm wearing these so far.  one interesting side note - i have no idea what these are made out of but my dog is absolutely fascinated with their smell.  he keeps trying to sneak off with them and pilfering them from the basket where i store them.  he doesn't chew them or even spend much time with them but he is interested enough to get into the basket and pull them out.  no idea what that's all about.
29882	"nice warm mitts and so easy to take off and put on. easier than 5 finger gloves. i am 5'8"" with hands 7"" from heel to tip of middle finger. 3.75"" wide. medium fits perfectly. wanted use them to keep hands warm in cold airplanes."
29928	"got a pair in natural, small.  they fit my 7""-around-palm 7""-long hands snugly but not too tightly - perfect fit.  seem reasonably well made.  plan to wear them under another pair of gloves for extra warmth."
29935	these fit well and are not bulky. perfect addition for anyone who has cold hands at any age or time of the year
29942	this case is well designed, the clasp needs to be tweaked a little, closure is tight when first used. ok, though...
29990	i had been told these run small in size so bought the next size up and they fit perfect...but if you didn't know to buy the next size up you'd be sorry.  great slippers and high quality.
30002	the description says these socks are seamless - they absolutely are not.  i had a big seam going down every toe which caused constant rubbing.  these socks are so uncomfortable and rubbed my toes/toe webbing so much that i had to take them off after 20 minutes of use (my toes are now sore).  i *highly* recommend you pass on these socks - i will be returning mine.
30016	i am a guy with large feet (just under size 13) and fairly large toes. i do love these socks but they barely fit around my toes and the length of the sock toes doesn't match my toes exactly. i ordered the xl size and just barely squeezed into these, even though they are for 13.5 size and up.  i am gonna see how they work out. if my foot was even a hair larger, there is no way i would be wearing them at all. with all the different toe sizes on humans - it is understandable...
30084	my 91 year old mother loves these socks - they separate her toes and give her warmth she is always looking for.  she has one toe growing under another and this sock relieves the pain when she wears shoes.
30097	not for me.....ok.....would not buy again......injinji performance mini crew toesocks,black,small ...overpriced in my opinion and i decided against the toe shoes....just not for me!~
30122	these socks are a mus with vibram five fingers shoes if you are a daily runner. however, they will not hold up to repeated washings. mine tend to fall apart after about two dozen washings. theinjinji performance micro toesockscost more but hold up better. either way, don't try running too far in vibram five finger shoes without some injinji socks. i did and i regretted the blisters that formed after three miles.
30152	my local store stoped suppling this type of underware. im not sure why. i love them. they hold up well after normal washing. no tearing or falling apart. much better then fruit of the loom. the nylon is great cuz it dose not show a panty line.it is kinda sad that i have to order my underware online and by the pound. ;)
30159	"this was a great product for a long time. so for a few years i put up with inconsistent sizing and having to buy a 5 pack to get 3 or 4 good ones.  i have compared them right out of the package new side by side, and they are never all cut the same size.  i'm now done with them.  i have worn the exact same size for years, but unfortunately hanes does not know what ""exact same size"" means.  i bought 2 packs at kmart today (april 2013) and both are going back.  they have now cut the length of the outer side seam from 8"" to 7"" and apparently believe that still constitutes a ""brief"".  i will never buy them again.  if i could rate them less than 1 star i would.  and by the way, it does no good to complain to hanes.  they will send you some for free and tell you that if you complain again, you will be ""required"" to return the exact same free ones they sent you. it's a shame when a good product you have bought for a long time turns into something not worth buying anymore.  i will be way less likely to purchase any hanes brand item after this.___________________(try jms (justmysize), similar product with better fit)"
30221	"i own these but i don't wear them anymore, nor will i be buying more in the future. while they're very soft and come in pretty patterns, they don't stay put despite their claims. they don't have a very full coverage in the buttocks, which then leads to shifting and having to manually put them back into place. sort of defeats the purpose of buying a ""wedgie free"" panty. my biggest complaint however, is that without fail, at least 1-2 pair in each pack is cut oddly or much smaller than the rest. leaving me no choice other than to throw the pair(s) away. they don't do what they promise, and they cause me to waste money by having to discard brand new panties. not a bargain in my opinion."
30249	i expected more out of these.  the fabric is very thin & after just one washing and never used,  they've already started with a small hole in the seam.  that shouldn't happen and is not a sign of high quality.a plus is the lack of a tag-so no scratching. i washed & dried (low heat) in the usual fashion  prior to first wearing, but i have to say, i'm quite disappointed by the quality. on inspection, there are a lot of redundant threads on the inside.  fit is good overall-but they run small.  (flimsy) not nicely made.honestly,  a six pack of cotton underwear at costco is a better value, better fit & higher quality.  ([...]) . i paid almost $20-$12.45 plus about $7 for shipping & handling.  not worth it!  so i expected more. hanes needs to find a better manufacturer
30251	in general briefs as pants, normal quality, you can wear. especially no claims. would change little tailoring. but just normal.
30342	these do run big, but they will shrink. they will shrink in length and in the waist. i bought my regular size and they were huge. after i washed and dried them a few times they fit perfectly. they do have some stretch to them as well and sit below the belly button. the bottoms are slightly flared. i recommend these for anyone needs khakis or work uniform pants.
30379	hanes is a brand i've used for a long time and have been happy with.  these comfortable, all-cotton panties fit well and &#34;breathe&#34;, which is an important health feature.  i recommend them.
30506	i am wearing this bracelet as i type, and i have to say, it is truly magnificent. the seller shipped the bracelet very quickly. the clasp is extremely secure so you'll never lose it. very classy and elegant.
30535	nice medium purple color, not too dark, not too light.  unlike the necklace that looks similar, there is no discomfort caused by these earrings.
30644	"i'm giving this 4 stars for the simple fact that i've had a little difficulty with sizing - i normally prefer my gym shorts to be a size large, so initially ordered a few pairs of these in large and found that they slid off while jogging, even when cinched.  mind you, dropping down a size always feels good, but i was a little surprised.  i then purchased a few pairs in medium (for the price, i figured having a bunch would be good, as i wear a different pair each day while working out).  the medium, to my surprise, still slides down pretty easily too, even when cinched.  part of this is because of the material - they're a very smooth mesh - and i wear compression shorts underneath, so the combination of the 2 makes them easy to slide down.  not really a huge issue, but i've had other gym shorts that stayed in place a little better.  that being said, i'm overall very happy with these - just be prepared to buy your true size rather than sizing up or you might have a similar issue.a big pro to these - they feel great!  the material is very light and doesn't feel bulky while working out, unlike other mesh shorts i've owned over the years.  the don't restrict range of motion at all and are very comfortable!  also, i like mine to be a bit longer which is what initially drew me to making a purchase - i stand about 5'11"" tall and these fall to mid-knee for me, which is right where i want them.  that is a huge selling point for me!one word of caution with the white - they're basically see-through.  i love the look of them, but if you plan on wearing them to the gym or outside for a jog, be forewarned.  you can see the tie string right through them and tell what color of underwear you're wearing without even needing backlighting... so depending on your choice of undergarments these can be a little shocking depending on when/where you wear them and what you wear them with."
30645	good fabric and all in all these are pretty good shorts, i just wish they were longer. i have big calves so it looks super dorky when my shorts don't go past my knees, or at least rest right below the knee. if i could buy these same shorts but longer i would.
30720	these champion shorts fit great and are as cool and comfortable as can be for exercising. champion quality is as expected, the same as all their athletic wear. i bought three other colors and will buy again.
30738	this thing is so bad i'm not even sure where to start. the size is off, the fit is off, and the overall design is a huge fail!!!!!! to call this thing a boonie is a slap in the face to all legitimate boonies out there. the chin strap came loose within 3 minutes of its arrival. and the way they roll this thing up and tie it with the chin strap to ship it should be a crime!!! i only gave it one star because you had to give it some rating to write a review. in reality it is closer to a -3 stars!!!!! a complete disappointment!!!
30768	super light-weight great for those who get hat headaches, well-made, sunblock hat. costs somewhat more than the copycats, but well worth it for all the careful details included in this hat. the only thing missing is a lightweight clip to keep it from blowing away, but easier enough for me to add. (planning to wear chin strap in back with clip on collar.) recommend this over similar low-cost sun hats with rear veils. i ordered both, what a huge difference! keeping this, returning the other. this sunday afternoons adventure hat is made in viet nam (read - quality). high recommend.
30818	this fits well, easy to get on and off, great lift, very comfortable.  great price also.  i will definitely purchase again.
30829	i usually always go with playtex because they seem to last longer. i like this bra except for the fact the back part looks wadded after you wear it awhile. if they could fix this problem, it would be a great bra.
30884	the size is small, which is a good and a bad thing.  it's easy to carry and light, but the size limits what you can put in it.  i have a bit weight i wanted to put it in and use it for a gym bag, sadly the weight didn't fit.it does have alot of pockets though to carry things in and is overall a nice messanger bag and fits snug around your shoulders.i just wish i would have realized how small it was when i purchased it, because i can't use it for what it's bought for, but i do still use it and don't regret getting it.
31016	this sandal is so pretty. the color is a perfect neutral taupe. not muddy taupe, but luminous taupe.i like that the sandal covers most of my foot. i wear a size 11 and these sandals looks great on my feet.i have plentyof room in the front. do not go up a size. there are adjustable straps on top as well as the back. i have calluses on the bottom of my feet, so the rubber insole is a little hard. i have that problem in all the shoes i buy though.
31064	i like the looks of it, but once i tried wearing it the buckle would continue to open and the end would stick up/out. the little brackets used to hold down the end that is pulled through the buckle kept sliding as well, so it wouldn't stay put. i think i have to return it!
31083	excellent for warm to cool weather either worn alone or as a light weight base layer. the camo works by itself, and the shirt holds up to all day hunting trips even in hot weather and multiple washes.
31131	"update 9/4/13  bought this in feb. 2012 and it is still keeping good time for a cheap automatic.  it still looks great and has been worn while doing everything from showering, to landscaping. before purchasing this watch, i owned a seiko 5 automatic.  it ran for 10 years before giving up the ghost.  it never kept accurate time even after adjustments made by a jeweler.  i read reviews and researched this watch before purchasing it.  i saw some negative reviews but decided to buy it anyway since the positive reviews outnumbered the bad ones significantly.  so, here goes.  first of all, i have small wrists, around 6 in..  this watch looks fine on it and does not appear to be overly large or too much of a stand out in size for a small wrist.  it has a nice weight and feel to it also.  i won't go into technical details which have already been addressed so many times in other reviews.  i have owned the 8926 ob for a little over a month and wanted to give it a chance to get ""broken in"" before writing this.  it has a nice one directional bezel (turns to the left). when turned, it snaps positively into the increments and turns with a little effort but not too much.  it has a decent, fairly solid bracelet made of stainless steel. it wears quite comfortably on my bony wrist without pulling hair either. i must say, i am fairly impressed with the metal in this bracelet.  i generally have trouble wearing stainless bands as i usually break out from them.  this has not been the case for this watch.  i did have to adjust the band for my wrist, but this only took a minute or two.  i like the observation glass on the back of the watch, and feel it adds a nice novelty flair to the timepiece. this watch is much more accurate than my seiko 5 ever thought about being. update: 8/10/12 i have worn this watch regularly for around 6 months now.  after its initial break in period it has slowed down to losing around 4 min per month.  i just keep it set 5 min. fast as i like being early to work anyway.  this is the only issue i have had with it and have found it to be a very reliable watch.  the crystal is still scratch free and overall, i am still impressed with what i got for so little money.  i actually worked with an individual the other day who owns a rolex and he asked me if i were wearing one.  i also had a young woman who commented on this watch and told me it looked like a fairly expensive piece.  it is exposed to heat, moisture, dirt on a daily basis and has had no problems. at this point in time, i would not hesitate to recommend this watch.  it has good looks, durability and inexpensive.  worth every penny.  update:  6/6/13  i can still say this is one of the best values in the watch world today.  the crystal is still scratch free.  the lume still works great (it's not a black monster but it does work well).  the band is still in good shape and timekeeping is on par with my invicta 9211 and my citizen eco drive.  yes, this watch is an automatic.  but it keeps very good time for one. it actually seems to be keeping better time now than when i first purchased it.  i set it a couple of minutes ahead about every month and a half and it does fine.  i am a watch lover and i like all kinds, digital and analog, automatic, battery, and solar.  i wear this watch probably more than my g-shock or my other watches. why?  because it goes with anything from blue jeans to shorts and suits to swimming.  i have no compunction about wearing with anything and it just plain looks good.  i love my other watches.  but this one is special to me.  buy one and i think you will find it to be special also."
31156	this is a nice watch.  collect watches and it is one of my favorites.  it is comfortable and i really like that it is self winding.
31189	bought the cheapest brand-name flip-flops amazon had so that i can use them for pedicure sandals.  they're ok for that, but highly uncomfortable.  the footbed is flat, and it feels very difficult to keep them on the feet!
31193	these would be great if i didn't compare them to sanuk yoga mat. here's how they compare. *nothing* compares to sanuk yoga mat for squishy soft all-day comfort.  these are definitely soft and comfy, but lack some of the underlying support that the sanuk has under the soft.  we need more quality like that.
31223	for the price and shipping i was disappointed. i expected a better leather and the buckles seem pretty cheap. not what i expected from birkenstock...
31239	100% cotton. doesn't make my husband pant with lust but does not make him laugh at me either.comfortable. recommend!
31256	i have been looking for socks that are not 'one size fits all' for a long time.these are great! they do not leave marks on my ankles where other socks do from squeezing too tight on my swollen ankles.
31259	socks too large and bulky for a woman (in the foot).  the size around the ankle were fine, but too large to fit into size 8 woman's shoe for my 93 yo mom
31262	"i love this watch. it's stylish and looks more expensive than it is. i have gotten many compliments on it. my only complaint is that even after a jeweler removed all of the links that he could, the watch is still a little big. my wrists are quite tiny though (not even 6"" around) so i am used to this in most watches. i guess i have to shop in the children's section next time :)"
31276	it doesn't look cheap at all, in fact, people ask me where i got it. it's small and very delicate looking.
31318	i just got my boots out of the box and love them. i was anxious about sizing after reading other reviews but i got a size 9 and usually take  a 39-40 eu size and it fits perfectly. i find that i have room for tucking in trousers too. the calf sizing seems pretty standard too for australia... maybe sizing, or legs;) are a bit different in the us hence all the concerns from other reviewers... they look good. my feet are hot in them, so i can't wait for some cold weather to stomp around in.great value! i'm going to go buy some other bearpaws now too.
31477	having wide feet and arthritis makes it difficult to find comfortable shoes - but these are amazing!  i purchased them in white micro fiber stretch, extra wide - i can actually wear these for a day out running errands and forget i have them on!  they are easy to clean with a damp cloth and a bit of comet.  when they were really dirty, i put them in a gentle cycle with cold water and set them in the sun to dry.  i found that the laces were a bit too short to tie loosely (with swollen feet) so i purchased longer ones.  perfect!
31520	these t-shirts are a great fit.  long enough to stay put and don't shrink in the wash.  just wish they came in more than a 2 pack.
31647	this was my 4th merrell purchase and as previously experienced, they are the best.  this shoe is a little bulkier (less feminine) than my others but also has more cushioning. great stability as always.  will make an excellent walking/hiking shoe as the sole tread is aggressive. this will be my go-to shoe for the next few months as i rehab from an auto accident and the extra comfort and stability will be a great asset. i highly recommend this shoe and this brand. sizing has been consistent in all four styles. delivery was quick and as always, thanks amazon for the great value!
31740	i went to glamorise's website to look up measurement guidelines to help me select the right bra size before ordering. i entered measurements on their website and ordered bra size recommended. when i received the bra, the bra is too tight in the band size. these bras run small and i would recommend ordering a size up in the band size that you normally wear. also, as soon as i put this bra on the band immediately rolled. i'm hoping a larger band size will correct this problem. overall, i like the bra but i don't think it will be suitable for high-impact activities.
31851	i bought according to the size chart. however, the front looked biggish while the back was outright blousy. had to make a rare return to amazon.
31862	i have no complaints about these trouser socks.  they are comfortable, stay up well, and i plan on purchasing more of them in the future.
31897	it's warm. it's durable. it covers your ears. it's breathable. it fits big heads. there is no better winter hat. when you get it brand new, take a shower with it on your head. once it dries on your head, it will fit like a dream. it will last you a dozen years as long as you don't wash it in the laundry. hand wash and dry on your head.
31901	"i'm not sure if i got the same hat everyone else did.  i have a couple of carhartt heavy cotton unlined jackets which i love, but this carhartt hat in navy is fairly thin stretchy fabric, and is not warm in temps below 35, and does not keep the cold wind out.  even though it is acrylic, it's a bit scratchy, not very soft. it is sized well enough to cover the ears with the bottom folded double, but even that is not enough to keep the wind out or keep my ears warm in colder weather.  i bought a better hat, made of soft wool, for about the same money here on amazon which i rated 4 stars: ""all wool genuine government issue watch cap"" ... maybe this hat is better suited for warmer temps, but i don't think it's even as good as the acrylic watch caps i have bought at k-mart."
31995	lovely material--just a little sheen to it, and seems sturdier than other brands i've tried while still delicate--and i even got to like the black seam (i definitely thought it was tone-on-tone rather than black on nude, which is my own mistake for not reading...). however, when these were pulled up so as to take the most slack out of the hose, the lace was waaaay up my leg and really cutting in since it was at the widest part of the thigh. it broke blood vessels by the end of a couple hours and i had to move them down a bit, which meant the lace showed when i sat and crossed my legs (wearing a knee-length pencil skirt). i'm 5'4 and juuust on the far side of the sizing chart so i ordered the appropriate size for my weight, but i might try the next size down and see how that works. the silicone top absolutely kept them up while the lace looks attractive--they never felt like sliding down, which impressed me.
32039	an ex-football player past his prime (6'3&#34;, 360 lbs, size 13d, medium arch), i was recently diagnosed with plantar fasciitis. my orthopedist recommended daily stretching exercises and orthoheel slippers to wear indoors (no more walking around in socks). what a difference! the slippers and exercises lessened my symptoms from the start and, over time, eliminated most of my discomfort, so i decided to find some orthotic inserts to improve my street shoes.so far, i've tested:1. dr. scholl's massaging gel extra support2. aetrex copper medium arch3. spenco polysorb total support4. superfeet copper dmp5. powerstep pinnacle6. powerstep pinnacle proeach for two hours' total walking time over a few days in two pairs of my favorite shoes: new balance 606 hikers and cole haan loafers with nike air.dr. scholl's massaging gel extra support: advertised for big & tall men, they didn't do much for me. while the extra cushioning helped at first, it helped less and less the longer i walked on them. i mentioned this to my orthopod and he told me the key to managing pf is not cushioning, it's support. grade: dspenco polysorb total support: remembering my doc's advice, i chose these for the rigid heel cup and arch support. though quite comfortable overall, the arch support was a bit too low for my medium-high arches and the heel cup was insufficient support for weight. while they worked reasonably well for me, i believe they would a be better choice for lighter individuals with lower arches. grade: baetrex copper medium arch: promising better arch support, these felt very similar to the spenco insoles even after walking around the block. i then swapped one of the aetrex insoles for one of the spenco insoles and walked around again. only then could i tell them apart. the spenco offered a little better support for the mid- and fore-parts of my foot, the aetrex offered a little better support for my arch. grade: bsuperfeet: i was in an allen edmonds store and noticed the superfeet insoles. the clerk said many men my size have good success with them. i tried the orange and the copper dmp versions in the store. finding the orange too high for my arches, i got a pair of the copper dmp. these are easily the most rigid of the insoles i've tried...and easily the best. superfeet arch support sits farther back on the insole than other brands. this made a real difference in the support and comfort i felt walking long distances. i also found the medial post support in the heel did a better job than other insoles in combatting over-pronation. grade: a [update: i have since tried superfeet black in dress shoes that couldn't accommodate the orange insole. they work well but are not as supportive as the copper.]powerstep pinnacle: while it seems well-made and offered good support, it simply did not work for me. the gel-based arch support sits too far forward and in the middle of the insole. the insoles felt like i had lumps of clay underfoot. after a few blocks of brisk walking, my feet began to fatigue as if i were walking barefoot in sand. again, these may work for some people but they didn't for me. grade: cpowerstep pinnacle pro: other wearers commented that the pinnacle pro differs markedly from the pinnacle, so i tried a pair. i barely made it a block before heading back home. though more rigid than the pinnacle and with a better heel cup, the pinnacle pro was too inflexible through the arch and ball of my foot. these were the only insoles i tried that truly caused me pain. of course, it could just be the contours of my feet, and for others the pinnacle pro might be great. grade: f
32062	finding shoes for a husband with very wide, very flat feet is hard work! there isn't a big selection out there ....and even if you can find something wide enough, there are so many parts of a shoe that can pinch or rub or otherwise irritate, that there's no guarantee it will fit right. having said all that, my husband was very happy with these hush puppies slip-ons. they are wide enough! they are lightweight! and they can even pass for dress shoes...well...compared to other shoes he wears..... he's happy and i'm absolutely delighted.
32081	this is the third leotard i've bought from the company. they fit perfectly, they are comfortable, and i can dance freely in them. this one i've also worn under a few skirts and it's quite warm and slimming.
32085	i ordered xl coz i'm well-endowed. the top part fits well but it was a little bit loose below coz i have small hips. the sleeves are very long for me so i just fold them.
32110	perfect fit and i do not need to wear a bra (mine did not have a shelf bra) which is really great. i will be ordering more of these in different colors and different sleeve lengths.  i am not a dancer but used to live in leotards for many years and i wore them with jeans, skirts, shorts, and sarongs.  i'm ecstatic to have discovered them again especially since the material they use today is tremendously improved.
32111	after reading the reviews, i went with a medium.  i'm 5'2&#34; and 114 lbs.  pretty slim all over (petite build) but a slight belly and 34c bust.  i didn't want anything tight or riding up.  this fits really perfect.  there was no shelf bra which i am okay with.  they usually aggravate me anyway.  also, for those interested, there are no snaps at the crotch.  i'm not a dancer...just like one piece leotards under skirts and shorts sometimes.  i can't stand to tuck a top in...they never lay right.  i will end up getting the sleeveless and the long sleeved versions as well.
32152	i bought this leotard for my daughter.  she's between size 6 and 7, so i ordered size i (6-8).  it is fine for the price.  the length is correct, but it doesn't fit her body all over the way her other leotards do.  in some areas, like near the armpits, it fits too loosely.the shell is made of 90% nylon and 10% spandex.  the lining is 90% polyester and 10% spandex.  my daughter has some cotton leotards, which i think are more comfortable.
32154	i bought this for my 4 year old niece and she loved it. it fit her great and she wore it with a bunch of dance outfits. i'm glad i got it for her.
32232	i bought both the 19 inch and the 31 inch.i do not know what i was thinking.the 19 inch is just fine.both work...i just wish i had thought it out...the 31 inch is made solely for a woman standing and can not bend at all.other than that, the product is okay...thus get the 19 inch unless you are the above mentioned. :)
32239	i am writing this review after owning these pants for about six months:  these red ledge pants are great.  they are sized true with the understanding that they will be worn over another pair of pants, although sometimes i wear them without another pair of pants underneath, too.  these pants are extremely light and are able to be packed in a (supplied) mesh sack.  they have thus far held up very well during inclement weather outdoor use, snow shoveling duties and the like.  these are my second pair of such pants, with the first pair lasting me ~15 years.  these pants will definitely fit the bill if you are looking for lightweight, waterproof, reasonably priced nylon pants and they will most likely last you a number of years.  the only minor complaints i have are that they are quite noisy when you are walking in them and that the buttons at the bottom, while well intentioned, interfere with walking and bang against your ankle as you are doing activities, particularly if they are unfastened.  do not let this stop you if you require a pant of this type.  overall, i really like them.
32263	i use these shorts as pajamas in warmer weather.  i like that they have pockets for carrying stuff around the house.  however, they are fairly thick and i don't ever see myself using them for exercising, there are plenty of better options out there.  i'm also curious how soffe shirts, which are a cotton poly blend, can be top of the line undershirts in my opinion in terms of fit and feel, but these shorts are just average at best.  i think soffe should thin these things out and make them in line with the undershirts and they'd have a great product.i have a 35 inch waist and the large fits well.
32357	ordered my reg. size 7.5, but these were way too big.  also the footbed is very slippery, so even if it fit, don't think my feet would stay put.  not a good design for me anyway... sent them back.
32370	i've had these for a little over a month now.  they fit ok but if you're barefoot, which i usually am, the fur not the inside sheds terribly.  when i take them off i constantly have to pull fur off my feet.  the interior fur feels really, really fake so they don't even have that going for them.  they are very, very warm.  i've worn them outside several times (in the winter) without issue.  however, inside my feet become boiling hot very quickly.  with the shedding issue i'm afraid to wash them lest i be picking fake fur out of my washer, dryer and clothes forever.  overall i wouldn't buy these again.
32385	my husband is a big man, bought these for him for christmas, he loves them, not too hot, which isone thing i debated, living in florida, before buying.
32413	i like these, but had to trim them to fit my size b width shoes. i have another pair, the pink ones that are made for women's shoes. even though the size in the title has a women's size, they are definitely c/d width.
32488	"there are at least several general types of gaits which people have. some feet tend to over-pronate (a person who walks more heavily on the inside of their feet), over-supinate (a person who walks more heavily on the outside of their feet), or have a more-or-less ""neutral"" gait (not pronating or supinating excessively). the normal gait cycle involves some degree of pronation and supination. arguably, too much pronation or supination can cause pain in your feet. although gait issues can be hard to diagnose, it can be fairly easy for a trained doctor to tell you whether your gait falls sufficiently outside the norm to require some kind of corrective treatment.enter superfeet, a less costly alternative to a custom orthotic device for those in need of controlling their foot motion. as advertised, superfeet reposition your feet inside the shoe by firmly cupping your heels, supporting your arch, and generally keeping your feet from moving in such a way as to cause pain. for those who need them, superfeet are very effective and do their job nicely. they are also easily obtainable for a good price, and marketed as a premium replacement insole.superfeet are very popular and the way they sell, you'd think every person has significant gait issues and requires motion control devices in their shoes. in reality this is not the case (see first paragraph). for example, i have a pretty neutral gait. i pronate just a little on one foot and actually supinate on the other a bit, but by-and-large i walk fine. however when i developed some heel pain i decided to try superfeet because they are advertised as a solution for that. i ended up with knee pain because these forced my feet into an unnatural (for me) walking position that altered my gait and put pressure on areas that were not accustomed to it. i ended up seeing a doctor who instructed me to use cushioned insoles only instead of something rigid like this. fortunately i was able to take advantage of the 60-day money-back guarantee for these which is a nice thing.my point is this -- superfeet makes a great product, nothing at all against it, and if you need it i think it's a far better investment than expensive custom orthotics that do the same thing. but if you have a problem with your feet, or knees, or hips, or anything else, see a doctor before buying any devices to put in your shoes! a good orthopedist will be able to direct you regarding what sorts of inserts, if any, you will need. you may be able to figure it out on your own or by going to a running store, but if you get it wrong you may end up making matters worse. that was my story and sure it's my own fault for not starting in the right place, but it's a common mistake to make.so overall: 5 stars for the product (it does do its job) - 1.5 stars for the lack of clarity in the advertising as to the type of gait problems these are supposed to treat = 3.5 stars."
32507	i wear these in my sneakers and in my hiking boots. they help my back from hurting and keep me going when trekking. i have tried all 4 colors and the green ones work best for my feet.i don't leave home without them!
32536	they breathe well and the comfortsoft band is a really nice improvement.  i like these better than boxers i've bought that cost (singly) more than this whole pack.
32544	this past summer i had surgery on my stomach.  as such, i needed something that wasn't too binding or too constricting.  i often wear hanes &#34;tighty-whitey's&#34; but with the scar left, they were totally out of the question.going to boxers wasn't too far a leap as i have worn them on and off over the years.  these feel comfortable, hold up - physically and literally - well and wash/dry easily.all in all, i'm really happy with them.
32588	great insoles, but ordered a pair that were the same size as my ugg dakota slippers and they were way too big for the slippers, despite being the same size.  if you need a pair to refresh the insoles in your slippers, try ordering one size smaller.  these may be made more for the boots... and that information was not included in the description.
32639	"these superfeet 3/4 high heel inserts only work well in a few of my lower heels.1.5-2"" they seem to shift my weight back on my heels a bit more and add arch support. in other shoes the dr. scholl's gel inserts work better because they conform to the shape of the sole and add a soft surface to stand on. i will be using both brands and moving the superfeet from shoe to shoe as needed."
32646	delicate dainty look that give these shoes a dressy look that can go from office to evening.  comfortable as well.  given as a gift and the recipient was thrilled with them!
32658	ah, it's the age-old question - boxers or briefs? well, for me, it's definitely briefs. i love the look of a man in tidy whities, and these classic y-fronts are just the ticket. i love the look and feel of these briefs, and can't recommend them enough.(review of jockey classic full rise brief 6-pack underwear)
32666	this is a short review, if you know what i mean. the same jockey underwear you've been buying for ages. what's not to like?!
32675	i love my swatch i love big watches & this was definitely a good match for me.. i definitely reccomend it & the price way cheaper than the mall.
32688	i used to work for a sporting goods retailer, and these were the top-of-the-line insoles we always recommended to customers. in my current line of work, i sometimes have to stand for 6 hours on concrete, wearing steel-toed boots. these greatly reduce my foot and leg fatigue, and i still recommend them to friends. absolutely worth the money!
32728	i bought two pairs from amazon around my expected size and got a great fit with the smaller pair.amazon makes it so easy to return the pair that did not fit. i went to orders page to get an rma. i printed out the rma form and the free return shipping label. they come in a plastic bag with a spare adhesive strip, so i put the big pair back into the bag and used the spare adhesive strip to seal the bag. that took 15 minutes.i dropped them off at staples at lunch time for ups pickup and when i got home amazon had credited my card without even waiting to get them back. it cant get any simpler. saved 2 hours by not having to drive to rei, which didnt even have one of the wide sizes i wanted to try in stock.-------------------------------------i bought the boot for desert hiking, so i did not get the more expensive &#34;gore-tax&#34; version. if the boots and my feet some how get wet in a spring or wash, they will dry out pretty quickly in the desert. in fact i avoid gore-tex products because a cheaper alternative called event (made by ge) has been tested by the us army labs at natick, mass and found to offer superior breathability. for a citation, &#34;google army natick goretex test&#34;they are definetly not for back packing--just day hiking--because the soles are not stiff.if you are going to be scrambling on limestone out in the desert, a sole made of stealth rubber(tm) is better, but since its just a vacation trip, i decided on these.the wide size fits true for me.
32763	my husband usually wears a size 12 shoe, but found these to be too tight for his wide foot. returning the shoes was as quick and efficient as the purchase!
32805	really sturdy duster. classic cut with removable rain cape. you can feel the oil and wax. looks great and actually quite warm. perfect for a rainy day and with a sweater i'll probably be wearing it in the snow too.
32807	this is a very heavy duty oil skin duster that i will be wearing a lot. it is a little bigger than i expected, but that leaves room for a lot of layering in the cold. overall i really like it.
32955	oh my gosh, even bra discs aren't this bad.  these are like a cruel joke on women seeking a nipple concealment solution.  they make you look like you have big, protruding, hard, areolas.
33020	i haven't actually used them yet.  i have to wait for the snow to go and the weather to warm up but they look just fine.
33093	these are amazing.the colours are just as they are in the picture. i have a narrow face and they fit very well and cope with the bright new zealand sunlight. hey arrived in excellent condition. i would recommend these to everybody.
33170	im 5'2, size 16, with a 40e chest. i bought this bra in the largest size possible at a 44ddd just for more room in the cup with the strap size getting bigger.. this bra is wonderful. yes they bounce a bit, but my girls are going now where. the bra material is very soft and well made. love love love it!
33171	"i am a full, round heavy ddd/f (36-38). i have worn wacoal forever because they are worth every penny. great support without feeling like your wearing a suit of armour and they literally last for years. this anita bra is not for a full, large cup. it has absolutely no support. i actually bounce when only walking! it only had 3 rows of hooks which isn't enough for a an extra large cup size. and it was uncomfortable. the back rode up and the hook area scratched. i bought 2 of them from amazon because they had the best price for this very overpriced bra. i could only return one because i wore one to ""test"" it. the sizing was accurate but not worth the money at any price. i was really disappointed.i do want to add the amazing ease of the return process through amazon! all i had to do was set up a return through their site and ups picked it up at my door! and it was free! becuase of this i will be shopping amazon much more in the future."
33238	based off the reviews, i decided to get a medium thinking it would fit well. unfortunately, it's big and when tucked in, it just parachuted out too much and looked odd and bulky. to give you an idea, i am 5'6&#34;, 37 inch chest, 27 inch waist, and 39 inch hips (i typically wear 36c bra, m-l shirts, and size 10 pants)the reviews were right in saying the color is much brighter than the picture but i still liked it. also, don't be irresponsible like me and put it in the dryer, the wrinkles are hard to come out. however, i like the shirt quality and cut so i reordered it in a size small and tossed this one into the goodwill pile.
33276	i have other size 30 shorts that fit comfortably, but these were very tight in the waist and hips. probably need to buy the next larger size.
33310	i thought that hi-cut meant that the briefs came high...up... to one's waist.  but hi-cut means cut high on the thigh.  so i am a bit disappointed, because i like to have my briefs cover from waist to all of my bottom...but that was my fault for misunderstanding.
33313	i just refuse to pay $7 for a pair of panties!  i love these; they are 100% cotton, wash up great, and last a long time.  they are very comfortable and don't wrinkle leaving lines that show through your clothes.  i cannot beat the quality or the price.
33331	was looking to replace a pair of old totes socks made for wearing as slippers. these are identical except black (versus the old totes blue) and they have more serious traction. these socks actually have plastic strips on teh bottom to keep you from slipping. i rarely slipped with the old ones but this is probably a welcome addition. they make the faintest noise when i walk on hardwood floors, but i expect that will stop over time. they come up just past my ankles and are super comfortable and warm. i am very pleased.
33369	this shoe helps keep my foot supported, so i can walk more in it. at the end of the day, i switch to my 5-year-old squishy crocs for around the house.
33376	i was hoping these crocs would offer my something beyond the classic caymans in the &#34;soft department&#34; in the toes.  i had seen them advertised as a rx clog and really soft in the toes.  they are not softer than the originals.  they also were too tight in my instep and caused me to limp after a while of walking in them.  they may be fine for someone with a low instep though, as mine is high.  to date the crocs i love the best are the cayman classics.  i have 3 pairs and will probably be buying more.
33391	esta polo no es lo que se ve, la tela no es de muy buena calidad, supongo que es por el lugar donde fue fabricada
33402	i've had it now for a week and keeps great time.  i wear it every day so there is no risk of it not winding up (automatic).  it looks great.  i'm not a blingy watch guy.  glow in the dark works great, very bright! i can see the face at night.  the watch band is comfortable.  very solid watch!
33458	i bought this bra, half expecting that it would not fit as i hoped.  i was wrong!  the reviews i had read were fair and accurate.  despite the thin straps, the bra hold well and is supportive.  i like the thin straps as they allow the use of thin-strapped tops without making the wearer appear careless of her total look.
33574	the instep area is too wide/deep for a narrow.  unable to keep and had to return.  ordered in 9.5n, and usually wear either 9.5n or 10n.  the length appeared to be ok.  the shoelace area left about a half inch or more above my foot, even with socks, even laced tightly.  appeared to be comfortable with medium cushioning, but no real experience in that area so will not comment further.
33583	this is the most well-made, high quality leather bag i've seen.  i don't buy many handbags now that i use a cane in one hand and need both hands free.  all the &#34;fanny packs&#34; or waist bags out there seem to have one thing that ruins their looks, makes them look cheap.  either it is the waist belt part that is a flimsy vinyl or woven plastic, or an awkward fastener.  or the pockets are either too big or too small and have zipper pulls that snag.since i carry this kind of bag daily, for the most part, i'd like it to look at least as high a quality as my regular handbags (good,  higher-end leather ones).glad i discovered piel.  i am only ordering another of the same bag i've used for the past 4 years because the old one has an ink spot on the back from a pen leaking, and is just generally faded and worn looking after daily use for that long a time.  nothing about the old one is broken or even unraveling at its seams.  it is one of those articles of leather that, if you wanted to, you could keep for 10 or 20 years by just carefully cleaning and using leather conditioner regularly. oh, and keeping pens that may leak out of the bag or at least well-capped.  my old one will go to a local clothes closet as it is still quite useful for someone who'd like a nicer bag that could be easily refurbished with a little leather cleaner and conditioner (and elbow grease).piel makes a size larger in this style of bag that i also own and that is not so worn out because i use it (less frequently) for travel - - - longer trips requiring more &#34;stuff&#34; to use in my bag along the way.  it is of the same high-end look, but twice as roomy.  i switch to this smaller version for day to day use.  it is just perfect, and i've even gotten compliments while wearing it - interesting as it is such a utilitarian accessory!
33608	these are the best undershirts ever!i love them, i love them i  have a few colors and will keep getting them untill i have 2 of each color.perfect fits and are long great for layering or sleeping in .great buy and company thanks
33611	i got a few of these tanks! i guess everyone has a different view on the definition of soft. love love love the pretty colors. hate the feel and wear of these tanks. they are long on my short body eh. what really annoys me though is all the snagging on everything they touch. they also feel itchy as hell. one tank came with a crease line that didn't go away with washing either. yucky! yuck!
33644	i am replenishing my supply of this summer sock after a few years of problem free wear.
33662	slightly big so i had to put an insole in this shoe.  overall, it is a nice looking shoe with a heel i like.
33663	usually have no problem ordering easy street shoes to my size, but for some reason this pair of pumps were way too tight.  had to go to the next size larger and they were too big and the toe box seemed to be a lot smaller than normal.  will have to find another type of shoe for my son's wedding.
33667	shoe polishes don't last long and they're filled with chemicals.  this product lasts a long time and is environmentally friendly.  most importantly it's not as messy as shoe polish.
33766	this is a standard bag.  material is not much or no thicker than some free gift bags.  two bottom corners have extra reinforcing material, but on one side only and it looks like a thin, fake leather.  it would not stand long with school books, as required by my kids' school:  no backpacks during the class time.  they were cheap, but full shipping was charged for each.  i added metal washers as reinforcements.
33771	i purchased this for myself and it works well, i recently purchased a second one as a gift and the recipient loves it.
33777	i don't fold these jeans for the cupboard or hang them on a hanger. i stand them up in the corner. they are tough. that is what i wanted. the only down side is that they have the plainest design around the pockets, zip and belt line i have ever seen. the wife feels they will not be worn at social occasions! i am half way between size 32 and 33, and have a mix of wranglers in both sizes. these ones i bought 32, and they are a bit tight around the hips. not tight at the belt line, just not as much room around the pocket line. i'd get 33 and a belt next time, if these ever wear out.
33808	well-made, beautiful pants, but my husband swam in these.  i bought an x-large, and he is clearly an x-large size.  but these were too big in the waist, way too long, and i returned them.  the large might have been ok, but by then he neeeded them quicker than mail, so i purchased them from a big box store.
33936	they are foot specific so you have to pay attention when you put your socks on in the morning :(.  couple them with a pair of kso treks and you have walking bliss. they are not as thick as i would have liked (a wee thinner than boot socks) but they are much better than my pair of anke-height lightweights which feel like dress socks.i would give them five stars if they would put the corresponding foot letter on the tag as well. its petty, but for socks this expensive your allowed to be petty.
34016	i had been eyeing this pendant for a while before purchasing it.  i really count on the reviews to give me an idea of the value, but being the bargain shopper i am i always want it for less.  recently this item was offered for 50% off and i decided to buy it as a gift to myself.  i wore it the very next day after receiving it and i can honestly say it is a nice pendant.  as with all of amazon.com collection pendants the necklaces that come with them are very light weight and may tangle easily, but the price can't be beat.  the dragonfly on this one sparkles nicely and is a good size for most women (just over one inch in height and just under one inch in width) if you also like to wear earrings, i recommend some sterling ball or cz/diamond studs with this.platinum overlay sterling silver 8mm round cubic zirconia martini-set stud earrings
34077	"if it were large oval shaped, this ring would look a lot like bella's(twilight) engagement ring. it looks excellent on the hand. it has low profile, 1/2"" in diameter, heart. the beadwork and milgrain in the heart  photographs a little darker.the, highly polished, band is narrower than photographed. i would have preferred the wider band as shown.  the setting is very lightweight silver, but it's not flimsy.  the band looks like white gold...it's definitely plated. the stones are bead set and done well. this ring doesn't catch on your clothing. comfortable wearing.it's an elegant looking ring. each stone is approximately 1/10ct. in totality, the ring appears 1 1/2cttw.i'd bet most people complimenting you, will assume you're wearing diamond. for me, i like both diamond, and the cz...which is a beautiful stone in it's own right. i mix and match both sparklers. i paired this ring with a very narrow diamond eternity band. they look great together. my only reason for not giving 5 stars, i wish the silver setting were heavier weight solid silver; it is a very lightweight ring, but i'm not complaining. this ring gives a good look for a small pricetag."
34097	these earrings are even more beautiful in person.  the 4 marquise stones in each earring are perfectly matched and the silver workmanship is excellent.  could not be happier with the quality and the value!
34118	i wasn't too sure about buying jewelry online but i took the plunge. it came in a dark blue box with a velvet like pouch inside. i held my breath as i opened the pouch......amazing! the necklace looked exactly as pictured here. the quality was amazing especially when factoring in the price. why buy fake jewelry when you can get the real thing at these prices? this was purchased as a gift for a younger relative and are best suited for the younger crowd or petite.i am at a loss over the complaints.  the measurements are posted and accurate.  the photo is magnified to show the detail.  if you are expecting the photo to be life size you will be disappointed.  check the measurements listed for more information.
34179	"these earrings are quite nice. they measure just over 1/2 inch long, and they fit comfortably. although they are not the most spectacular czs that i have purchased, due to the small size they look quite real. overall, the earrings are pretty & sparkling and seem like a good value. but ...the construction is not very good. the earrings torque when they open and close. moreover, on one earring, one of the clasps did not engage and the earring was not secure when worn. after reading others' reviews on losing earrings, i consider myself lucky that it did not happen to me.previously, jewelry that was offered in the old collection -- the ""amazon.com collection"" -- was a great value, and i have many ss, cz, and plat-plated pieces from that collection. currently, jewelry in the new collection -- the ""amazon curated collection"" -- does not seem live up to that standard. i've purchased several pieces in the new collection & have been disappointed nearly each & every one. i had hope it was a fluke but i'm now certain it's not. the new amazon curated collection jewelry lacks quality and is not a good value.tagged ""made in china."""
34182	i love the earrings, but i was very unhappy with the packing from amazon. the posts were pushed flat against hearts and i was able to carefully straighten out. won't know how they will stand up until i can remove my peircing earrings and wear for a few months. i am very disappointed with amazon not stepping up to packaging better.
34195	my daughter gave me these earrings for mothers day, as garnets are my birthstone. and although i have many, many, garnet pieces a classic pair of garnet studs i did not own until now. the coloring is beautiful, the deep reddish brown of a quality garnet, not too orange and not too 'black'. it catches enough light in the basket setting that it really lights up on the ear.the 6mm gemstone size is the perfect size for my ear, not too big, but not small either. that said the post is on the longer side, this is great if one has thicker earlobes, but for me i just have to push the earring back a little past the post stop so they don't hang forward. speaking the post and backings, they securely fasten at the post stop, and haven't slipped backwards past it.for the great price these are an excellent value for a gorgeous garnet earring.
34272	i bought these a size up for my daughter so she could wear them longer, but they are too big to wear at all this winter, so now i'm not sure what to do. we will probably need to buy something else and keep these for next year.
34311	some people say they are too thin, but that is intentional!  these are for lounging about or sleeping in, not for going out in.  very comfortable.  perhaps the best constructed of this sort of thing.
34355	the pants are great but the the first pair had a &#34;malfunction&#34; and the draw string broke.  this required additional work to repair which didn't really make me happy.
34372	soft and comfortable and look a lot better than regular sweats.  prefer the non elastic bottoms, look a little less casual.has pockets.
34422	i've had 4 dri fit shirts from russell and am very pleased with it, until i got this one. this shirt was shorter than the others despite all of them being xxl. this one has a thinner material as well which makes me feel uncomfortable when i wear it out. and the picture is misleading as its similar to the previous shirt i bought. i've realize the mistake and decided to wear it at home since its such a hassle for me to send returns from my home country. i've printed out a reference of the shirts i wore and will look carefully before purchasing. i wish that all the sizes across the various models of shirt of standardized so i don't have to double check and or worry that it won't fit me and its easier for me to choose the models i want to buy to wear.
34453	just the way i like my shorts !!!fits just the way i like them ... no surprises !great shorts !great price !
34466	i was pleased with the shorts and the service.  this is a reasonable price for reasonable quality.  i would order it again.
34526	these is a very good cotton underwear: comfortalbe, does not ride up, soft thin cotton, no seem lines visible on the clothes worn over it, stylish.  i've bought the hanes equivalent of these to compare, and i like fruit of the loom's better.  you don't get the printed patterns shown on the amazon site, but i like the ones they've sent me.
34543	no you don't get a choice in colors but who cares?  it's not like our underwear are worn over our clothes.  i got black,white,and grey which is fine.  i've bought another well known brand here on amazon and was not crazy about them at all.  but these were pretty good.  they have such a nice stretch which means they stay put!  the size was perfect and they are really comfortable.  gave 4 stars only because the material is a little on the thin side.  it will be nice for summer but just hope they hold up okay over time.i would recommend.
34573	i consider myself to be a pretty solid size 10, and i occasionally wear a 10 w (usually with wiggle room for thick socks).  i got these shoes in 10 w for extra comfort in a dress shoe, and they were too small in every direction.  i returned them for an 11 w, because i did like the look of them.  i hope they fit better!
34654	my child has small feet and has been walking since her first birthday. that has resulted in us going through several shoes because they are not made well or finding decent priced shoes with hard soles is impossible. when i cam across these i jumped for joy. they have held up great and still look brand new after a month of abuse. the covered toe has protected feet and the shoe (that was the part my child always ruined)  and the soles have a good grip. they did get into a little water on concrete and we didn't notice any slipping but they were never fully submerged. they have been easy to get on and off and my toddler can do them herself as well. i highly recommend these as i have already ordered another pair!
34705	"so, this is an expensive shoe, as well as brand.  i'm a bargain shopper, which includes being cheap at times, but this year i decided to get my kids some good summer shoes, especially my three year old since he had $20 shoes similiar to this last summer, but his feet were really stinky.this is a good quality shoe, all 3 of my kids didn't want to take them off.  i ordered a size up for each of them, and this is a little long at the toe, and because they run a tiny bit wide, the extra toe space makes them seem a bit floppy.  overall, however, they are fantastic looking.  i wish they gave shoe measurements by the inches of the insole...here are the actual measurements of the shoes we got:toddler/little kid size 12m: inside sole measurement from the tip of the toe to the heel: 6 1/8""little kid size 2m: 8""this is the actual size (as exactly as i could measure) of the inside of the shoe where the foot goes.  i took a blank piece of paper and traced each of my children's feet (if they could not giggle & wiggle) and measured both feet from the longest part to the heel.  on some children it's the big toe and others it's the second toe.  use the larger of the two feet to size a shoe, and typically a 1/2"" of space is the right amount from the toe to the end of the shoe.  i hope this helps!"
34809	i have had birkenstocks for about 3 years now, and i cant think of a better shoe or sandal that helps with flat feet, fallen arches, pronantion, and arthritis in your knees. i had such a difficult time walking because of the above problems. since i have started wearing birkenstocks, my arches have become more defined, and i dont have such a hard time walking. i love this style, the gizeh. the other styles i have are the miyari and florida. i will definetly buy closed toed birks for the fall and winter.  once the birkenstocks conform to your feet, you can walk all day in them with no pain.
34835	the fit was good, the style was nice, but didn't like the plastic straps. i felt that it made the sandal cheap looking. i prefer the feel of leather.
34909	got my shades very fast and i love them.  had a thought though.  you should totally do a variety pack.  3 pair, 3 different styles :-)
34939	i have 3 of these and a size large fits my 5' 9&#34; tall, 160 pound frame well and provides sufficient of rook to move when wearing shorts and a t-shirt. they would not fit as well if i were wearing jeans.  the pockets are a bit deeper than some others i have tried.  as is typical, the leg length is longer than i need.
34942	my little miss sunshine is a regular fashionista, but her mom is a hobo....or at least her bank account says so...so thank you amazon for making it not hurt so badly....by the wayshe says they were faboo!!!thank you!!
34948	the sandals i received were fakes. i am very familiar with this brand i own some. the sandal i received wasn't even a good knock off. i am extremely disappointed in amazon and these are going right back. (i have ordered shoes on amazon many times and this has never happened before).follow up: i contacted amazon customer service and the representative told me that they purchased these sandals from the manufacturer. well no way jack rogers was the manufacturer of these plastic/not leather sandals. i am receiving a refund but am very disappointed because i have never purchased anything from amazon that i felt had been misrepresented until this point.further follow up: i contacted the company jack rogers about this purchase and sent them pictures of the obviously fake plastic sandals. i heard back from them within 12 hours and although they did not sell me the shoe, jack rogers graciously offered to replace them with genuine jack rogers sandals at their expense stating that they very much cared that fakes were being sold but wanted me to be happy with my purchase. buy your shoes directly from jackrogers!
34961	"i've never bought a bra on the internet before so thought that i would give amazon a shot. i knew that it was risky just seeing pictures instead of the real thing. this bra is definitely made to fit the ""buxom"" woman. the comfort is unbelievable, so much so that a person can sleep with it on and not even know it! i love this bra and highly recommend it!"
34996	i just had breast reduction surgery and found that this bra was soft, comfortable and supportive.  post-surgery i've been wearing this style bra 24/7.
35008	i agree with both reviews, this bra is perfection.. i am a 36 dd, and this makes me feel comfie, supported and you hardly know it's on your body.great t shirt bra.....need one in black....bali women's no poke seamless underwire bra #3318
35098	haggar pants run long, so i ordered 32 length instead of usual 34 - fit perfectly.  well made,  wash well and look very professional.
35160	these pants appear to be well made of substantial fabric. unfortunately they were too small in the waist. it's togh for me to find pants that fit, a 32 waist is typically too tight and a 34 too loose. i did find a dockers d4 in a 32 waist that fits pretty well.the problem with the fit is likely my 65 year old body that has suffered the ravages of gravity- relatively small waist but a substantial &#34;gut&#34;.
35187	this shoe fulfills my wish to have a white sandals or shoes that can go formal or casual.  a bonus is that they don't get streaked up like other white shoes--they stay white.  a good buy!
35212	i wanted a large bag to more carefully carry my iphone - but it had to hold all my other stuff too; every woman knows what that means.  this bag is lovely - but more of a shopping bag.  it has so many pockets, zippered, snapped and otherwise that i actually couldn't find my iphone one day.  go figure!  but, i've got all the different places memorized now and the bag works well for me.  i could probably carry a lot more - and will probably do so.  it's very attractive and i like the microfiber as it cleans up nicely and works well in the remote michigan climate i live in.
35326	i love these g string you can see so much vagina through them... there many other panties on amazon that are so much more material and cost as much but i got these just because are so sexy. i think every guy's girl should have at least one pair for those special occasions.
35331	i love to see my woman wearsuch sexy naughty g-string. oh boy. i love to see my w wear such sexy naughty g-string. oh boy
35392	first of all the &#34;v&#34; of the neckline is off center. the sleeves are too short for being and xl and the body is box shaped. i have bought hanes for year and this was not up to normal standards. very unflattering fit.
35494	i typically wear a 34 or 36 but these shorts feel a size or more smaller than what you normally wear. if you buy them i suggest buying a size or 2 up. i believe one of the other reviewers had the same issue.
35535	this was the first time i purchased (or tried on) havaianas, and i it was a bitter sweet moment...  firstly, they are extremely comfortable. secondly, they run small.  i tried to convince myself that they would be fine (i didn't want to return them!), but in the end i made the right decision and sent them back.  returning them was an extremely smooth process.i ended up purchasing the next size up and i'm glad i did.  they fit wonderfully!  i love these shoes, i already purchased a second color, perfect for summer, very comfortable!
35549	as others have said the sizing posted is incorrect. size 39-40 is correctly size 7-8. i wear size 8 and these fit me. otherwise the flip flops is as advertised and i am pleased with my purchase.
35579	i like these flip flops.  they are slim but very comfy.  i've only worn them for a couple hours at a time so i don't know how they would be for a full day of wear. but for what i've worn them for they are great!
35619	stretches out after a while. doesnt stay up. and it only delays the inevitable... your are going to have to buy maternity pants at some point.
35635	a size 2 is great for a big growing belly but the material stretched out beyond its shape.  it even started losing its thread after a few washes.  not worth it.
35640	this feels just like a tube top you would find in any shopping mall. i put it on and the length is okay, but i found it loose so it doesn't provide enough support that i need.
35674	i found this bag to be much larger than i had expected. as pictured it looks smaller than when you pick it up - when the bottom will hang down. it was not worth the freight and restocking fee for returning it. if you want an inexpensive  large duffle bag it is otherwise fine.
35702	i found these varied in price a great deal so was worried that, somehow, this one was skimped on for quality, but not so. it's soft, well made, & my daughter loves it.  so .. i win!
35763	lovely rings!  other reviews that stated that the rings were too scratchy to wear seem to have exagerated the feel of the rings, they are not perfictly smooth, but they dont bother me at all.  they look like real diamonds.  i thing the size runs pretty true if slightly small.
35765	these are cool because you can stack them together, or separate them to enhance other rings.  i would give them 4 stars, but i think all these other reviews will make you think they are better than they actually are.  don't get me wrong, they're cool, but calm down people.
35816	i ordered this ring because it was so pretty and it got great reviews however, i am not happy with it at all but for the price, i will get over it!
35828	i love this ring! it is really shiny and i get lots of compliments on it. it isn't very big, but well worth the money.
35830	"i got this for my mom for mother's day and she loved it. it looks beautiful and the stones have a very bright sparkle to them. my mom already has much more expensive rings and i kind of figured that she might not wear this one too much, but i still got it because i knew she would appreciate the gesture of her daughter buying her something from her very first earnings. i love it so much i'll be getting one for myself as well! although, don't try to fool anyone into thinking it is the real deal; it has a big ""china"" engraved on the inside of the band, so maybe don't take it off if you're trying to show off lol. it also comes with a nice little gift box and a little ring pouch(not the kind shown in the picture, but it works). delivery was prompt."
35937	"i received my haflinger at slippers today and i must say that i'm disappointed.i had such high hopes for them because of all the great reviews they have received here and on other sites.negatives:a.  the left and right shoes that i received are different sizes.i'm sure this is a rare manufacturing mistake, but it is annoying nonetheless. the right shoe is 3/4ths of an inch longer than the left one and is wider than the left one -- even though the size stamped on the two bottoms is the same.  therefore, i would have to send this pair back even if i loved everything else about them.the left one fits and the right one is way too big.  i am not sure if the right one or the left one has the accurate dimensions for the shoe size that i ordered, so if i did reorder, i would not know whether to stay with the size i ordered the first time, or to go down a size.b.  these do not lessen my heel pain from plantar fasciitis.quite a few reviewers have mentioned that haflinger slippers are good for their plantar fasciitis, but unfortunately my heel pain sparks with every step i take in them on my bedroom carpet.(i have plantar fasciitis in my left heel, and the left slipper is the smaller one that does fit the length of my foot well, so it's an accurate trial.)maybe i would think a little better of the cushioning on these slippers if i had never tried fitflops...two months ago, i discovered fitflops.  their footbed -- if one receives a well-manufactured pair -- is absolutely great for my plantar fasciitis pain (and scores of other reviewers of them have said the same).  indeed, it erases my heel pain.  i wish i could wear them all day and in every situation, but alas, i cannot do that this winter, because the only fitflops i was able to keep were several pairs of their summer flip-flop sandals.  this is because many of the pairs of fitflops that i have ordered and tried out in the last 8 weeks had problems of one form or the other (or several issues at once).  i have documented those problems in my reviews on amazon listings of the fitflop products that i tried.  i posted a general overview of my experiences with fitflops, and a specific review of the fitflop house slipper, at:fitflop women's lounge deluxe slipper.  my review was posted oct 24, 2012 and is in the 3-star section.c.  these slippers are too wide for my feet (even the smaller left one that nicely fits the length of my foot).my bare feet float from side to side in them.  of course wearing socks with them would help keep them on, but i personally don't like to wear socks with indoor slippers.  additionally, slippers of this sort of material will stretch out over time (several previous reviewers have commented that they do stretch out), but if any stretching occurred, the shoes would begin to fly off my foot when i walked.i don't even have ""narrow"" feet, and i have always done better with shoes made for the german market than shoes made for the british or american markets, so i am not sure why these slippers feel so wide to my feet.  perhaps these are sized in a unisex fashion and are thus wider than female-specific shoes would be.positives:-have a slightly raised heel, which i need for my heel pain-are made of wool, which breathes, adjusts for hot and cool environments, feels nice, is natural, looks attractive-are washable-have a sturdy rubber sole-have at least some moderate footbed cushioning and some moderate arch support (which not many slippers seem to)-are made in the eu-look nice and understated (in the black at least, which i ordered) - they don't look like big boats or anything, which clog-type shoes sometimes can.i'm glad i tried these out.  i expect that for most people, who perhaps have wider feet than i - or who may prefer to wear socks with their slippers, and who have mild or no heel pain, these slippers are marvellous.  i wish they had worked for me!last week when i ordered these i was also considering giesswein slippers, but i expect that brand wouldn't have any more heel cushioning than the haflingers, which neither of the brands claim to have anyway.  if you do like haflingers, you might also want to peruse the available giessweins."
35973	i always wanted a tennis bracelet and since i can't afford real diammonds this made a great alternative. it is really fashionable.-
35982	i have a few expensive watches but decided to get a watch that i can use when exercising without having to worry about losing or damaging it. this watch fits the bill, it does almost everything you want it to do. i initially thought that the display was good sized, but after using it a couple of times for running, i found that it was not big enough (for me at least) so i decided to give it away and bought another timex with a bigger (44mm) face.
36054	these were for my wife. she is a shoe lover extraordinaire. i cannot even begin to tell you how many shoes she has, but it is a lot. cheap ones. expensive ones. dozens of them that i cannot tell the difference between, but the details are clear to her. her expectations for shoes are very high.upon receiving these sandals there was an explosion of excitement. &#34;these are the most comfortable shoes ever!&#34; &#34;i have been buying shoes forever and only now i realize how good a shoe can be!&#34; etc. needless to say, she was very happy.i was expecting the initial excitement to wear off and any flaws to expose themselves, but she has worn these a lot and also on one extended vacation, and her satisfaction has remained. she continues to comment about how comfortable and good they are and also her dismay at how bad nearly every other shoe she has ever owned is in comparison to these.based on all of that, these may be the highest rated product i have ever purchased.
36070	i really like the whole idea of a lightweight rain poncho. we purchased a couple of these and one in a youth size for our vacation to seattle. the only problem is, i really don't like how big this is on me. i like a tighter fit on my rain gear, because this just seems to float around me too much. but...if you do like protection from the rain in a pinch, this is great!
36082	mine came missing one side of the top button, so i'm deducting one star.  other then that, this vest is durable, warm and gives a surprising amount of protection given the reasonable price.  i actually got this because i have to were expensive shirts to my job at a catering company, this protects them from cigarette burns and such, it looks surprisingly swanky over a white dress shirt.  however, after getting a feel for how durable it is, i'd be proud to sport this as i scream along on my 2-stroke 450.
36093	the ring is beautiful--my colleagues complimented me on it right away.  the setting is simple but sturdy and well-made, and the stone is large, very clear, and well-cut.  the color is paler than on the picture, which is the only thing i can comment negatively on.  in all other aspects, however, it is a very pretty ring that i would be glad to wear everyday.
36100	i was a little frustrated with this ring before i even ordered it bc the seller did not disclose how big the stone is which i think is a big deal!! so i decided to read all 80-some reviews and not one review says how many carats or mm the stone.. some of the reviews describe the stone as  big or showy. and also a lot more pale than the pic. so i took my chances and ordered it anyways. when i first laid eyes on this ring i thought its a smaller stone than i was hoping for but it was way more blue than i was expecting!. its really blue but i think the correct word to describe this stone when comparing it to the pic is its not as vivid as the pic but still very blue. by no means clear or pale.  as for the size i am guessing its around 3 to 3.5 carats. i think the size in the pic is more deceiving than the color. i dont have large hands but i do have long fingers. i guess i was hoping for a little more eye catching like 5 carats but for the money its still a very nice ring. u wont find a ring for near this price at a jewelry store. amazom has some of the best prices on jewelry so if i can find a topaz with a larger stone for around the same price or a little higher im gonna return it or if it get cloudy. but if not i will happily keep it. also the band is a nice thickness for the size of stone and the four prong settting seems really sturdy. dont get me wrong this is a really pretty ring that looks 5 times more expensive than the actual price. will update in a few weeks!
36176	warning- these are not the moustaches pictured!!!!!  i bought these and got 11 packages of the 3 same designs (basic moustaches).  i was supposed to get 12 packages but only recieved 11.  they shed a lot and are not very sticky!!  they fell off after about 10 seconds!  if you want designs with different styles look elsewhere!!  again, they are not the ones pictured!!!
36192	this unitard fits true to size and feels comfortable.  i  have not danced in it yet, but trying it on it feels good.
36202	stumbed upon this shirt as i was looking for something more retro. i love how it looks and how soft it is. thank you for this product and delivering on time!!
36215	its a good tshirt, i just wanted to buy an &#34;army&#34;  t shirt for a paintball trip and it did its job, price and delivery were good, good product.
36298	i sure thought i already rated this!!! it covers my temple clothes without wrinkling my dress thus avoiding the need to iron each time before i go to the temple. arrived in a timely fashion. thank you.
36299	this was a great bargain.  it is a really thin breathable fabric.  it won't keep your dress dry, but it will however protect it from getting dirty.  this isn't meant to be used as a garment bag that you take on a plane or anything like that though.
36328	the item looks exactly as shown in the photo. i absolutely love this body stocking. i ordered the black one size fits all (i am 5'7, 125lbs) and it fit perfectly. it is super flattering and covers any light cellulite and veins you have. i was also pleasantly surprised how well made and soft this garment is, especially considering it was under $10. paired with a nice g-string and shelf bra (i am a natural 28gg, and provides some but not much support for your breasts) with black heels, you will have your significant other begging for more ;).
36339	super sexy. my wife thought they were funny and didn't get it, but i love them. any thigh high works for me. they are pretty tight and squeeze her thighs more than most thigh highs do. she is pretty small, 5'5&#34; 112 lbs, fairly athletic build. she doesn't have stick legs, but def. not thunder thighs either...
36358	love the bag...perfect size for my needs and i like leather because it is tough and lasts and lasts. the only issue i have with ordering again is the shipping....it seems they ship via homing turtles, so you wait and wait and wait!!!!
36377	if i was purchasing these earrings for myself, they would be much too small.  they are the perfect size for my 8-year-old daughter who i was purchasing them for.  she wanted earrings just like mommy.  she is thrilled and i am thrilled as they are similar to a larger size version i purchased from amazon for myself last year.  i think they would be too small for 16 years-old and up, but they are perfect for your 'tween.
36390	i am at that age where my waste seems to be moving up even though my weight stays the same. this belt helps me accommodate to my ever changing waistline. it, also, is very attractive!
36422	good quality for the price.  thick and heavy duty just like the description.  i would recommend this item.
36513	i love this bracelet! the bracelet itself is, of course, gorgeous. it's so pretty and the red beads make it stand out even more.  the words carved into it match the message in the box.  now it comes in a very cute little box that makes great for gifts. and the best thing is the message. i love it. it's a great buy! great for birthday presents, christmas presents and presents for yourself ;)
36519	it is super cute but again.. you get what you pay for. very cheap and you can tell. it looks and feels cheap. it comes in a nice box but i was embarrassed to give it to my friend after seeing it because it looked so much nicer online. i should have realized this was the case being so cheap but it is nice for children.
36562	i was disappointed that they don't offer this shirt in my size. i was looking forward to howling at the moon with some ladies, but this shirt left me with a mid-drift that failed to help me attract any action at my family reunion. i'm returning this and plan to go back to my homer dress--so much more comfortable!
36565	"this review is for the ladies!! every time i go out with my man in this hot and manly wolf shirt i ask myself, ""are you woman enough for the man that wears this shirt??""now, listen up ladies, before you buy this wolf tee for your guy just know that other broads will be all up on your man trying to get a little piece of him once they take one glimpse of this sweet, sexy shirt. there's no getting around it. i mean, a t-shirt with not one, not two but three wolves howling at the moon! come on, you know ladies love it! so, whenever my man wears this shirt out i bring my biggest purse along, so i can girl fight and beat those other chicks away. and after uploading and watching my fights on youtube, i've found that my prada hobo bag works best to keep the chickies away from him, because it's heavy leather and i added some funky metal key chains to it to make it a more lethal weapon. i swing my prada bag around, maybe a little hair pulling here and there... and before you know it, i've won again and that wolf shirt and the man wearing it are mine, all mine!now, you should know that i am not violent by nature but ladies just be 100% warned!!!.. because the sexuality oozing from this shirt is irresistible to women! so, if your guy suddenly shows up on a date wearing this raw, feral, hot and oh-so-sexy, wolverine tee be prepared to get your claws out and protect what is yours! and if you are wondering, the reason it gets five stars from me is because just looking at it has an aphrodisiac effect on me. plus, i love it that this wolf tee makes other girls super jealous and it makes me soooo hot for my man, it's a win- win!"
36607	i was a hit with this great valentine day gift.  red is deep and the stone looks great.  the setting is good and the horns and tail are a novelty my wife appreciated.  if your wife/girl friend is a bit naughty then this is the perfect valentine day (or birthday, etc) gift.  i recommend to all the guys that want to score points.
36796	perfect fit and totally comfortable.  love the idea that i can wash them so use in the garden all the time.
36798	i bought a measuring 9 menbut has been sending me a size 11 is too bigwhy this carelessness !!
36802	crocs are the most comfortable shoes ever.  they are therapeutic for tired aching feet and they are low in cost.  i would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a comfortable, lightweight shoe.  as a bonus, crocs come in a variety of colors to match a variety of outfits and personalities.  whether working, walking, or just kicking around, crocs are a comfortable, cozy, and colorful way to dress your feet.
36815	i bought wildkin backpacks for my twin daughters for school this year.  they chose the bug one (green) and the horse one (pink).  i also got the matching lunch bags.  they are all very cute and well made.  the fabric is nice and durable.  all but the horse backpack have the big teeth durable plastic zippers (not sure why the one backpack has a different one).  zippers are the first thing to go on backpacks, but these seem really durable.  the outside pocket of the backpack has a few smaller pockets inside, including one with a zipper.  the lunch bags are great -- very roomy.  i like to use rubbermaid reusable juice boxes and sandwich holders, and they both fit in there just fine with extra room for fruit or chips. the juice box holder is an elastic strap with velcro, so it will hold any container securely in place.  plus, there is a mesh velcro pouch on the inside of the lid for a small ice pack.  they also have an adjustable shoulder strap.no one has the same backpack as they do at school, and they get compliments on them all the time.  kids like them because they are cute and adults like them because they last.
36861	still the best sweat removing hats i have ever used.  nothing else really is close.  i have nike, asics, adidas, under armor, etc.  these just work better and remain dryer.
36882	i haven't had it long but it looks good and seems to be well made. its and inexpensive leather belt that's reversible.
36943	sent them to my granddaughters.  they loved them and so did my daughter!  well-presented.  beautiful.  i cannot tell you about the products' durability yet but will do so later..  thank you.
36983	i ordered this necklace because our sorority symbol is the turtle and i love it! will be ordering more for sorority members!
37017	nice pants, good quality and durable. they are comfortable with the extra stretch at the waste, stain resistant and wash well. price is comparable.
37019	i purchased these pants following a great experience with another variation of the dickie lp710, the previous model being purchased through wal-mart.  all things considered, if i would have ordered one size larger, i would have been happy.  perhaps wal-mart sells a slightly different proprietary product from dickes, who knows.these pants are durable, keep their crease, keep their color, have that great comfort waist.for the price, which is very fair, this is a great purchase.i recommend these pants!
37091	i really like the longer length, but found it a little tight. if you're between sizes, definitely buy the bigger size. if you plan to dry them in the dryer, you may want to go up a full size.
37100	it's too bad the quality control isn't better. i always hand wash before i wear something and noticed two holes in the fabric, but i'd already immersed it in water so i just figured i'd layer it because it is long enough to wear with low cut pants and i can layer it.it's too bad, i was planning on ordering a few more because of the fit, but it appears they just don't care what condition the product is in. very disappointed!
37123	"this top is good quality for the price! i love the fabric, it's very soft and stretchy and the length is nice. i am 5' 6"", 122lbs and the size small fit perfect. however i made the mistake of putting it in the dryer and it lost about 2 or 3 inches of length! so i recommend to buy a size bigger or just remember not to put it in the dryer."
37157	love this shoe! i have a 7 1/2 - 8 size foot and i ordered the 8. it fits perfect. my foot is slightly on the wide side and the fit is great. they are sturdy yet flexible. they have a deep tread for good footing. very comfortable.
37175	i really like the fit.  i thought the urban camo would be cool looking but i don't like it as much as perhaps a solid color.  it's okay but not quite what i expected.
37204	i have always been a big fan of the merrill line of shoes.  they are so light and comfortable.  but, in the past, they all looked really casual and a little clunky.  this design is very nice and much more dressy than the pairs i have had in the past.  great for travel and sightseeing.  super light!
37244	i bought these earrings as a present for a girlfriend of mine who likes big stud earrings. when these arrived, they were significantly smaller than what i expected - to be fair, amazon does have their dimensions written down, but i did not have my millimeter ruler handy & from the pictures provided, i assumed they were going to be larger. the color of the earrings that i received was not as vivid as the picture - the earrings i received were a very pale blue, unlike the radiant blue pictured. the earrings are beautiful and well-made, just not quite what i was expecting.
37285	while traveling in mexico, the string just came right off and i wasn't even being rough with it!  what a waste of money.
37317	i like the haggar cool 18 shorts because of the elastic / expandable waist band.  at almost 70 i have finally had to admit that i am not one of those trim 20-30 year old guys with the perfect waistline.
37341	"i love these when we are boating or at the beach or even vacationing where there is a strong possibility of rain.  these keep items like the camera, phones, ipods, etc protected from moisture.  they work perfectly, cost far less than the ""official"" underwater camera cases and are easy to pack.  i purchased several others as gifts for friends/family to use to protect their digital cameras and they all love them too.  easy to use and reuse."
37364	i ordered the large size, but it is very small.  i have not used it yet.  i guess it will be okay.
37455	very nice oxford shirt, especially good for uniform wear.  i thought the sizes ran big, i would get one size smaller next time.  i was very confused by the sizing chart - but just order what size your boy is currently wearing.
37462	i don't normally wear silver jewelry, but i love this necklace. i put essential oil on the pad and insert inside necklace and it's great aromatherapy. i put 5 drops of essential oil on the pad and it seems to last for a few days.
37576	the item arrived on time and as described. the price was outstanding and i was excited about getting them. they looked very nice upon arriving but after 2 days part the the tint bubbled up and chipped off near the rim. i was pretty disappointed.
37667	i have been purchasing this locally, but noticed the prices have gone up considerably since i started using them.  i checked amazon and was glad to find them at a cheaper price.  they arrived in a short amount of time.
37763	this is a nice dark blue hat for keeping the sun out of my eyes.  the hat has vent holes so that it doesn't trap the heat.  it stays on under moderate wind as well.
37764	i work in a professional kitchen, and i need a hat that fits over my (oversized) head, holds an ink pen above my ear, and isn't stupid hot. this hat fits the bill exactly.
37789	on me, the shape of these cups were too cone like.  i think the bra would be ok in another outfit that had more structure to it but i wore this - or tried to wear  - with a thin cotton summer dress and it gave me too much of a cone look.  another reviewer said the same thing and i didn't listen.  i should have listened.  i'm a 34dd and the bra fits well and its pretty comfortable and gives support, just not the style of support i was looking for.  the price was good so i will just keep it.
37814	i am a 34a and ordered my size in ivory. when i received it the first thing that i didn't like was the color. instead of an off white ivory color that i expected, it was more of a very dingy cream color. the second thing i didn't like was the fit. not only were the cups way too small, but i couldn't even get the hooks around far enough to close. to give you a reference, i'm 5'7 , i weigh 137 and wear a size 6. also, i'm an a cup and i've never had a bra where the cups are too small. so, i sent it back and ordered a 36b in white. no issue with the color this time, however the sizing was off again. the cups provided zero lift, zero support and although i was able to close the hooks this time, the weird muffin top that it created was very unflattering. not happy and therefore i cannot recommend this bra.
37826	i'm average sized with a fairly large bust, so i bought this in the size i normally wear and found it easily several inches too small - couldn't even get the clasps near each other!  when i recruited my fiance into helping me smush into the thing, it was tight, but not unbearable.  this is my first torselette bra, so i'm not sure if they're all meant to be this snug, but it has a nicely shaping cut which suits my figure and supports what it needs to.  no bulges, no weirdness underneath clothing.  honestly, if it were easier to get into, i'd probably wear it more often.as an every day item, i think i'd pass. but if you're looking for something to wear for a formal occasion of some kind and don't expect to wear it more than a few hours, it's a go.
37827	product came in a timely manner. i absolutley loved the fit around the waiste. it makes everything look so smooth. however, i would suggest going down one cup size for a perfect fit because of the cup style.
37859	i have the grey with the purple flourish.i bought these when i found out i had bunions and was dxed with planar fasciatis. the doc told me to only wear sneakers. fortunately the dress code where i work is lax so i was able to ditch my flats and start wearing sneakers. i chose these because: 1) they are sauconys and i've had good luck with saucony running shoes, 2) they are retro 80s which i love because the 80s are near and dear to me, and 3) they aren't all blinged out and ugly like a lot of sneakers now a days... it's gotten rediculous.these shoes delivered. they are comfy, have adequate support, they are wide enough to accomodate my wide foot and the toe spacer i need to wear to keep the bunions in check. they aren't loud or gaudy. i love them so much i bought my toddler a pair too.they are awesome. i have been wearing them for months and other than a little blue that rubbed off from my jeans onto them, they look new. no rips, tears, or anything. when the time comes i will get another pair in a different color i love these so much.
37912	room for  lots  of  chains and necklaces to  travel safely without  running into  each other.  even full, it  doesn't take up huge amounts of  space.  we have, in fact,  even  given them as gifts.  it is  so hard to find things  like this that don't cost a  fortune.  these really are  really nice
38001	"very, very difficult to get on and off....back hook and eye but must slide all over head to fit... a ""contraption"" at best... poor length in straps etc. etc.  would definitely not recommend"
38026	this is a great bra; good padding underneath the wires so you'll never pinch, yet the wires provide fantastic support.  the straps are wide and comfortable; the cups soft and enscapulating.  however, it always takes me a minue to clasp the back of the bra - since you pull it over your head, then have to clasp the back with the bra in position.  it wouldn't stop me from buying more in the future, however, since it seems to be the best engineering besides the enell bra, which looks like a straightjacket.
38082	for the price, this is steal for high quality spandex shorts. i have trouble sometimes finding shorts that fit since i am curvy, but these look great and feel great and are great for wearing under skirts or dresses for biking or just to the gym working out.
38099	i'm surprised by the low reviews.  i've bought 3 and i love mine.  it is very flexible and lightweight, which is what i like most about it.  i have used mine on a daily basis for a year now and it has held up perfectly.
38227	i am very pleased with this watch and thus far have had no problems. on the screen it clearly shows the time (down to seconds), the day and the date. it is comfortable and easy to set. i wear this watch everyday and have been doing so for over a year and there is little to no wear and tear damage. i have also worn it swimming and in the shower a couple times and have had no problems. there are some reviews here that complain about the screen getting water under it and fogging up. in my experience i have found that no matter what watch you get or however much it says it is water resistant no watch is completely water resistant. i would never recommend intentionally wearing a watch in water unless you really need to (even if it says it is water resistant). if you are a swimmer you can gamble the dice but no matter what the watch says about water resistance chances are it will eventually get water under the screen especially with natural wear and tear over time.overall i really like this watch and would recommend it.5/5 stars
38348	talk about over rated. not easily washable. shrinks easily. fit is bad. expensive. i think they advertise long lasting because they stay in your drawer instead of being worn.
38370	"i can't believe all the negative reviews there are for this belt. i am aware that it isn't top notch quality, but did you look at the price and think ""this is going to be the best belt ever!""?the belt is decent quality, and for the price i could purchase 20 of these and still pay less then what i'd pay for a belt brand new at a department store. also, i've been trying to find a brown belt with snaps on the back for interchangable buckles for 6 months and this is the first i found that wasn't insanely priced. i would and probably will buy more of these just to have around for the future. if one breaks, big deal i spent under $1 for it."
38387	comes in a nice gift box, but bracelet looks poorly made.  looks like it can easily come apart. not worth the money.
38453	these t-shirts do what they're supposed to. they have a tru-fit and are very comfortable. these t-shirts must've changed since the last time i bought them because they seem almost  paper thin. all in all, you can't go wrong when  you buy anything from amazon.
38483	he really likes these t-shirts and how they fit and he also likes the texture of them. he said this is where he will get his t-shirts from now on
38501	the sizes are fine, the price was great, but the fabric is more along the lines of &#34;soft&#34; t-shirts - super thin, not the traditional thickness my husband expected. that's tolerable but one of the brand-new, just washed & dried, gray shirts has a hole in both the front and the back of the shirt - possibly cut, possibly just cruddy textiles. i've gone over the other three t-shirts and haven't *seen* any holes yet, but the test will be when they're stretched over my 2x husband! it's my own fault i don't have the packaging, trash day was yesterday, or else i could return them all. very disappointed, but i should have remembered you get what you pay for - if it's &#34;cheap&#34; - it's gonna be cheap!
38620	i usually find fruit of the loom products to be acceptable, this particular package does not meet any standards. after only two times in the wash the waistband is unraveling from the short. they were far too expensive to be so poorly made.
38663	ordered these and they arrived on time. i took them out and there were no problems with them. have been wearing them and they are really comfortable. i would recommend.
38696	the wife ordered these to wear on st. patricks day, but will wear them many more times!  she is very pleased with the quality, style, and the size.  the celtic pattern is beautiful, and the square design is unique.  she likes that they are stationary on the ear instead of bouncing around.  the fish-hook is not her favorite, but they seem to disappear behind the lobe, which is a good thing!  the size of the square design is on the small side, but is still noticable and pretty. the quality of the sterling silver cutouts is well executed and clean, making the earrings look more expensive than they were!
38771	used it one time on a flight and the outer zipper broke. i had only packed one man's suit, one womans dress and one pair of shoes. needless to say it was not overpacked. i didn't even have anything in the pocket the zipper was keeping closed. the bag itself seems sturdy but bad zipper. disappointed!
38800	i wore these to a friend's wedding & i think they looked nice. i'm not crazy about the clasp but i suppose i could always change that (at least they won't fall off). like any pearls, make sure the color matches other pearls you happen to be wearing, but i quite enjoyed these. the price is a little high though, so i'd make sure you really love them before buying.
38949	this just my size bra is the most comfortable one i have ever worn.  it fits me like a glove and i'm glad i bought 2 of them.  i just wish it came in black.
38977	these fangs are awesome.  relatively easy to mold to your teeth, clip in and out just like they say they will.  i wear them a lot and they're still going strong!  can't eat with them of course, but you can sure bite with them! :)
39037	this has to be my fifth pair of akoya 7mm earrings.  if i could keep my daughters out of my bathroom, they'd last longer.  these are well made, with sturdy and secure backs.  i just love them.  the size is perfect for wearing with jeans or even an evening out.  they are not too large that they droop on my ear lobe... very nice look and good craftsmanship.  the pair i received had no visible flaws - and very nice luster, and this pair has a pink blush to them. they're not mikimoto quality, but much nicer than i see at zales or most of the mall jewelry stores - and you can't beat the price.  for $19, i wish i'd bought three pair.
39099	i gave these shoes as a gift this christmas, and they were perfect. they fit just as they should, and they are made of high quality materials. very happy with this purchase.
39151	the colour and  the fabric are really good.it is very confortable for my pilates classes.i do not know why you can buy a set, please design a t shirt or a jacket.
39165	"if you're 5'8"" to maybe 5'11""? these would be good. they definitely run long. i'm 5'7"" and they drag the floor when i wear shoes. the waist is thick and doesn't give much. i would have liked a more giving fit for better movement."
39181	these run quite small even though they are stretchy. i ordered up another size and they are still tight and i don't care for the material. the fabric is thinner than i like and tends to pill.
39202	very tight (am size 18), very thin material, but very comfy. will never wear out in public, but around the house & as p,j.s for sure.
39229	"the way the heel snugs you, and the arch is supported, and the leather litterally molds to your foot as you wear the loafter! i am a true size 7 and i got a ""wide"" seven and it fits like a dream. if you're true-to-size i'd definately forego the ""medium"" width.  i have worn these loafers 14 days in a row now--so comfortable i just don't want to take them off! hooray for italian leather craftsmanship!!!"
39257	i've had a hard time finding a sun hat online for my infant son and finally settled on this one. this hat (0-6mths) is big for my son and he has a big head for 2mths! i have to tie the velcro ties instead of press them (too much room left for baby's head). no way a newborn could ever wear this. the color came as described: light blue. it's lightweight and non-stuffy; perfect for warm/hot weather. lots of coverage too-- front and back which is wonderful! i plan to keep this and will continue to use till his head grows into it (also buying addtl. hats that will fit better for now as well).
39269	my son loves them wears these more often than the character ones.  he is comfortable and i am happy.  quality is good washes great.
39277	looks good despite it large size, i'm rotund and it makes me look slimmer and good.  feels good and stays cool .
39279	the large size seems  to be more like an x-large size and that can be to say the least  disconcerting..
39290	i love short sleeved shirts, since my arms are far too short for the sleeves on shirts which fit my neck size. this shirt fits very nicely around the waist and neck, and it is relatively cool and loose. and yet, it is a quite good dress shirt, if that is what you what.
39302	having a big neck usually results in a very baggy shirt. this shirt is nicely fitted and looks good, nice quality for a fair price.
39366	nothing good to say about these. nothing bad either. they are thinner than what i'm used to. elastic band is lower grade that what i'm used to. so they'll be used as my emergency shorts when i'm too lazy to do laundry.
39379	i was very pleased with these when i received them, but i have purchased 1928 jewelry in the past and knew they would be good quality. beautiful beading and detail, perfect length and drop. i wear them constantly and often get compliments on them. some of my favorite earrings as they can be dressed up or down.
39386	very small, color is dull, and they don't look as nice as you would think from the picture. sent back immediately.
39390	these are really pretty.  sparkly and a nice shade of blue. nice dainty size. they have a vintage quality.  perfect!
39410	it came as discriped, useful and protect the nack. just wish it would be more fashionable for girls. overall, it's a good hat for hiking.
39453	"i spent quite some time comparing long shoe horns. many had plastic parts. a few contained wood, which some people reported was brittle and cracked. some also had springs, which many people complained made them more difficult to work with.i decided to keep it simple. i ordered this shoe horn in stainless steel. i'm very glad i did. it's basically just a vastly elongated version of the classic steel shoe horn, but it's very sturdy, and doesn't bend or give any other sort of problems.this shoe horn is also quite a bit longer than most of the alternatives. when i ordered it, i was concerned that it would be too long. however, i'm only 5'9"", but the length of this shoe horn is not a problem for me. i imagine even a very tall person could use this shoe horn without a problem. it's simply a pleasure to use.the hook on the end of this shoe horn curves down enough to allow it to be hung on a rack, or over the edge or a shelf.highly recommended."
39472	i am overall pleased with this product.  easy to use. very durable and sturdy.  stretches shoes out overnight.  has worked great with a pair of shoes that i spent over $100 for.  it saves the pain of me trying to break them in the old fashion way.
39544	i was drawn to these earrings at first sight. i love the beautiful contrast of the colors and how the clasp adds to its appeal. the size is perfect and both sides have the same picture. i would've given a 3.5 because on one side of the earring, the gold appears moderately dulled/lacking in luster (gold) when compared to the other 3 sides. all in all, i give it a 4 because of it's uniqueness and it was the first time my boyfriend complimented me on them.
39564	this shoe looks as in the photo. fits a medium width foot with plenty of room in the toe box. not brilliantly aesthetic...but it is a walking shoe, i guess...but the one thing that is annoying for me is the placement of the strap. yes, it is velcro so it can be adjusted, but i wouldn't feel confident in going for a long walk in these shoes as i think the strap would either dig in or be so loose that the shoe would move.
39569	if you order a half size up, they're a perfect fit.  i recommend them to all my friends who like a sporty, one-style-does-all shoe.  they're stylish, supportive, great with shorts, sun dresses, capris, etc.  i loved them enough to buy a second pair of jambus in another style.
39581	having had my feet professionally measured, i was disappointed that these didn't fit.  i have actually between a regular and wide width so i buy a wide width.  sadly, these were still too tight and it's a major bummer because they are seriously great looking and feeling shoes.  back to the drawing board of being stuck with old lady shoes because you have a wide foot.....
39593	bought this for my wife and the heading says it all. she did not like anything about the watch so we wound up returning it.
39601	wear them a lot, cute, comfortable, great deal! had more expensive seattle rain drops that local artisan in seattle market had created, lost my favorites, so these have been a cheap substitute that still look pretty darn cute! very happy with product, fast delivery, happy girl !
39714	this costume is adorable but way too small. it is listed as a toddler size 2-4 but the packaging says age 1-2 which is much more appropriate for the actual size. my daughter is in the average height and weight for a 3 yo and it is too small.
39728	my daughter keeps her new baby in onesies and worries that if she is too warmly dressed that the risk of sids increases.  i worried about the baby's cold little feet.  these socks made us both happy.  i don't worry about her feet and my daughter doesn't worry about sids.  they are cute as heck and i am going to buy another box they are so perfect!
39758	"i love these earrings.  i thought that they might be real small but they aren't.  they also aren't long just a nice length.  they are 1/34"" from the top of the dangle, not the part that goes through your ear.  i love them.  i have a second hole above the one i used for these and i put a cz post in that one.  looks really pretty with the two together."
39760	absolutely love them, they look and feel great! they weigh nothing! great buy!  i recommend these for yourself or as a gift!
39770	this was a christmas gift for my boyfriend who would sometimes resort to wearing his shoes around the house.  he loves the foam insoles which make them very comfortable for kicking around the house, but mainly he loves that they have the hard sole so its easy to make the transition if he has to quickly run outside, or even down the the basement.  i'll probably buy another pair since these are getting so much use!
39819	i for sure didn't want to listen to the other reviews about this ring bending and breaking really easily so i bought it anyways. but it'strue. its really pretty but i've had mine for several months and it bent badly in the first couple months i had it. never broke, but only because i wear it sparingly for special occasions. i wouldn't buy this again
39827	if you have purchased other carnival long line bras thinking this will fit, think again.i have bought two other 32 b long line bras from this brand. they both have been the plunge back kind that come to the waist. i have a 30 inch chest and a 23 inch waist, and the waist on my other bras are actually a little too tight for me.i ordered a 32 b in this style, and both the waist and the cups are too big. the waist is closer to a 24-25 inch waist, and the cups project a little too far, almost like a bullet bra.if you have breasts that project out and a larger than 25 inch waist, you might like this item. the reason i gave it 1 star is because it is so different in fit than the same size in another style from the same manufacturer.
39877	i walk for exercise 4-5 times a week and this is my shoe of choice.  i keep re-buying punter because it is comfortable, fits well and wears well.  i wear an 8-81/2 in most shoes but always buy a 9 in athletic shoes and these are no different.  i can use a thick sock and still have room in the toe box for my foot to expand during warmer weather.  i never have to break them in--they're good for a long, fast walk right out of the box.
39879	i like the way the shoes look on and off my feet.  the shoe is very comfortable without having to be broken in.  all in all i really like this shoe thinking about buying another pair.
39886	great mid step running shoes. they help a lot in keeping the pounding off your heels which i really need on those long runs
39893	these sneakers were cheap and flimsy compared to what i had expected. i will buy shoes locally where i can try them on and judge the quality of the materials before i buy. i returned them.
39951	a very good buy -will surely recommend the boots to my peers and family that live for the outdoors -for sure!
39961	1st and foremost, these are jazz shoes so you need to buy these 1 whole size up unless you like your shoes really narrow and tight against the skin. (uncomfortably so i mean.) dance shoes are not work shoes so they should fit slightly more snug. as others have mentioned the bottom is slick like plastic which would be dangerous on a slick floor such as at a gym. as someone who will be using them on slick, hard floors, i personally wish they had a tad bit more traction, but its nothing a little sandpaper or razor won't fix. otherwise, they are very comfortable, and they also breathe well. they are really light which is great when you're dancing. def. a great buy, and they are significantly more comfortable than my previous pair from a different brand.***update*** after putting them to the test at a high impact zumba class they were still very comfortable at the end of the day and were easy to move in. i still maintain it was a must to order a full size up, and a little extra traction should be added if using a particularly slick floor as there were times i was kind of sliding around.
39964	love these.  zumba workout is done on carpet and before using these it was hard to make the moves.  now i'm a zumba queen.  buy a whole size larger though because they do run small.
40003	love this set. nice rich color purple. this is a carrying set for airlines. wheels were great it stands up without falling over like a lot of luggage. i would definately recommend. the price was a little more expensive than a 3 set up here i purchased as well but i honestly like this set better and it c&aacute;n expand in width. great luggage
40029	i will start using carry on luggage to travel simple and lite. i bought them for my first experience i will let you know if they were as good as i am expecting them to be in my trip. look good nice color. this are for my son, i bought the purple color for me
40032	i had a four day trip to take and i bought this set because i did not want to have to check in my bag. when i took the luggage out of the box it looked too small. however, once i started packing, i was surprised by how much was able to fit in this luggage.  i had one pair of dress shoes, sneakers, and flip flop. i packed my workout gear and three outfits, and other essentials. i could have carried more. i will say that you do need to fold your clothing in a way that will allow you to maximize the space. i would recommend rolling method for most items. this luggage is perfect for those of us who are not trying to bring our whole closet with us.
40054	this is the only silver polish i've ever found that i can clean my silver that has the black antiquing and it doesn't take it off.  no harsh smell which is a big plus for me.
40057	i bought this for my 10 year-old daughter last year and it broke within three months!  :-(  this was very sad because she really liked it and it looked adorable on her!
40118	these earrings are great for day or casual evening wear. great with a navy pullover and jeans!
40121	i agree with another reviewer, these earrings look much more expensive that they are.  they are big, with brilliant color and a smooth shiny, silky finish.  the description said 4mm square, and i was thinking the picture looked bigger than that, but i was still expecting small earrings.  however, they are much larger, i didn't measure, but i'm thinking they are about 10mm square.  they feel heavier than i expected too, and they were a perfect gift.  my mother just loved them, and she kept wanting to give me money for them, and i finally told her how much they cost, and she thought i was lying to her so she wouldn't give me money!  seriously, they look great, she loved them, and i'm here to buy a pair for myself.
40153	"i was really confused on what size to get.  i am barely 5'4 and 132 lbs and short-waisted. my stomach is my problem area. i've never had an hourglass shape, even when i was 110 lb. measuring the waist seems really hard. it says 3"" above your belly button, but if you shift the tape just slightly up or down you get a totally different measurement.  as best as i could tell, i was 34"" when relaxing, but i can 'suck it in' quite a lot, like to 31"".  advice on sizing is also conflicting - some people say ""be realistic"" and other people say order a size down.  i wanted it really tight, to attempt to re-shape my waist a little before my wedding later this year.based on the size charts and my measurements, it sounded like i am a medium, but i decided to try a small, even though i was concerned i might not be able to even get it on.  it arrived today and i put it on without too much difficulty. in fact, after a few minutes, it felt comfortable enough that i was able to move to the tighter row.however, it bunches a lot in the small of my back. i tried on some dresses and such over it, and the front & sides look fantastic, but the bunching in the back is super obvious. i don't know why it's doing this.  it could be because i am rather short-waisted. or perhaps because it's too small.  after wearing it for about an hour, i took  it off and it looks pretty wrinkled/disfigured in the area where it bunched.  the 'boning' or whatever you call it is kind of bent.however, i have to say that despite being very tight, it was pretty comfortable. it definitely improves your posture - you can't really slump in this thing.  i spend a lot of time at a desk so this in itself will be a huge help.  i can see how it will help with portion control too, because it's so snug around your tummy. i am going to start wearing it every day and update my review again in the future.edited to add:  after two months of owning this product, i haven't worn it as much as i intended to.  i found i can't wear it while working at my desk, because of the bunching when i sit... it's just way too uncomfortable and digs into me sharply. i don't want to wear it under my wedding dress because i wouldn't be able to sit down the whole time! i can wear it comfortably when standing up and moving around, so sometimes i wear it while doing light housework or shopping.  again, i still don't know if it's because i ordered too small, but i kinda don't think so... my friend got measured at a specialty undergarment shop for a corset for her wedding, and while it's not squeem brand, it's exactly the same kind of material.  i helped her put it on for a dress fitting and could barely buckle it for her.  her professionally fitted corset is way harder to put on than my squeem, then i imagine the sizing is ok for me... i find mine easy to put on.  i think my waist is just really too short and it's flaring out a lot at the bottom and causing bending in the middle, because it's sort of going over my hips rather than ending above my hips.  i almost wonder if i should try cutting it.  or maybe they should make a ""petite"" version for shorter people.  ?"
40177	ok, so i was a skeptic & decided to give it a try. from the first time i put in on i saw a big difference. now let me tell you i took the sdvice to up a size. i started to order a 2x but decided to go for the 3x. when the 3x arrived i thought &#34;how the heck am i going to get in this&#34;. i had to have my husband help me get up in it, but once he snapped me in it felt great. it was easy to wear and walk in. i even work to work. another review said to wear it before bed and sleep in it if it's very uncomfortable to wear during the day. but for me it was fine. i loooooove this shaper!!
40181	i read up on belly-wrapping after my c-section and bought a couple compression tank-tops from wal-mart, which worked nicely. i wanted something without straps and something with more compression and purchased the squeem perfect waist on amazon after reading rave reviews. when i received it and tried it on, it felt disgusting on my skin. it was uncomfortable and totally noticeable (even without a super-tight or thin shirt on), especially when i sat down. the seams and the boning are all very noticeable, and the rubber makes clothes catch and stick in a really weird way, like something would stick to you if you were really sweaty. i have wore corsets for years, and this is by far the grossest feeling and least comfortable thing i have ever put on my body. i returned it immediately.
40189	i probably should have sized down- as i really had no trouble going to second clasps on the first try. great compression-  though it's not a fantastic wear this and be skinny thing. you need to exercise and make good eating choices- hello!!!!but definatly better than anything else i have tried- as i am 40 and two kids later - yields a big tummy!!!
40206	update:  i've had my squeem for over 2 years now, and it still works fantastically in making my curves curvier, and my stomach flatter.  when i initially purchased the squeem, i purchased it to help fix my bad posture while flattening my stomach after giving birth to my first child.  now, two years later and after giving birth to my second child, squeem comes to the rescue and is helping me regain my figure again!it can be uncomfortable at times due to all the compression and the posture it keeps you in, but it really is doing its job.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~simply amazing..my stomach disappeared!  knocked off one star for those annoying backbones though...they hurt!
40223	"i had tried it all!!!  this little thing wins hands down.  i was convinced after watching a giant girl on youtube wear this.  she taped herself with it on at first and you think ""oh, i can tell she's chunky, but look at what it does for her waist.  very nice.""  but then she proceeds to unhook the squeem and reveal what was underneath.  oh.  my.  god.  she had stuffed more fat and rolls in there than you can imagine!!  i was sold!!i am telling you, this is a woman's best friend.  no one can tell i am wearing it.  it flattens my belly, and even after taking it off my waist stays smaller for a while, so i can tell it is training my muscles to come back together after two pregnancies and c-sections.  i am often asked if i am pregnant (i am not) and i desperately needed something to wear for any fitted clothing of mine.  my stomach stretched out really bad with my pregnancies and the muscles in my abdomen ripped apart, so now i look four or five months pregnant with this little tiny ball of a section of my stomach hanging out and loose.  it's awful but i don't have five grand to fix it.  but for forty bucks squeem did!!  i bought two of these in two different sizes.  at first i wore the extra large on the first hook, then the second hook.  after i lost 15 pounds or so i could wear the large.  i love the difference!i can wear it for about six to eight hours.  i feel supported and tight.  it doesn't roll up or down in the back like so many.  it stays put (the inside is soft to the touch, the outside is rubbery and doesn't allow for your clothes to shift around).  it covers a large area, from breast to hip, and certainly does make your breasts perky!!if you are doubting this thing at all - don't!!  it's the answer to your tummy troubles - or at least it was for me."
40225	i bought this thinking i would be able to wear it everyday to help with posture (and maybe, just maybe, eating habits). it was okay, and it was comfortable, but.. i bought a proper steel-boned corset a few weeks after, and started wearing that. night and day difference! proper corset with boning is amazing and does everything i wanted out of the squeem.. plus i just feel so damn feminine and beautiful wearing a corset.
40236	great product for giving you that snug fit...it does become very uncomfortable around the waist line if worn to long. i really do like this item, the only big issue i have is the fact that you can see the snaps through your clothing...so i suggest not wearing this with a tight fitting dress or shirt, because everyone will know your secret!
40269	hey now check out this new chick with the figure 8 shape. all jokes aside this garment really holds everything in.
40282	"i was excited to get this and for the most part i like it.just a couple of issues.the straps dig into the front side of my arms (on the side of the bra straps) and they leave welts. i thought maybe i had them too tight, so i loosened them... no luck. maybe my b00bs are too big and it pulls (or push) on them... i don't know :o) but no matter the adjustment, they really dig into my skin and it leaves marks.second issue i have is that when i put it on, i can't breathe. maybe this is a good thing, but i literally feel like someone is sitting on my chest; it even hurts a little. this is a somewhat ""small"" issue and i can live with it.another reviewer mentioned that it makes the ""rolls"" show on your back. well, yeah!!! if you happen to be a little big, like i am (i'm still trying to lose my ""baby"" fat - i got a size xxl), of course it doesn't take them away. you will not look like you have a nice, smooth ""skinny"" back. there's only so much this garment can do... and it doesn't perform miracles. it does take away your belly, so you can wear tops and it looks like you have a waist. it will not make you wear a smaller size pant though. it does make you walk straight and your gait and posture is improved.i got one for my mom in a size large and she absolutely loves it. she won't take it off except at night. i only use it when i go out.all in all, a great product. if only those straps didn't bother me so much, and if it didn't hurt to breathe, it would get another star from me.u p d a t e: i ended up selling this after about two months of having it. my chest hurt more and more, i couldn't breathe (no i didn't get a size too small - i got the correct size) and the welts it was leaving on my arms were a bit too much. awesome product but not for me. i switched to the maidenform women's firm control back slimming camisole and i like it better. it's not as firm as the squeem, but it doesn't hurt when i breathe or when i wear it and it still shows i have a waist."
40293	what a waste of time and money.  if you want compression with comfort, got to target and get the barely there beyond bare camisoles for 16.99!  this is a good product for post surgergial needs, but not for just shaping.
40394	for a saddle shoe, which is inherently somewhat stiff and flat (no arch support), these are amazingly comfortable and flexible!  i got them for a 50's sock hop, and even my 50-something bad feet are pretty comfortable in them.  good soles for dancing too!  and the fact that they come in a wide width was a bonus for me.
40432	why do we buy wool t-shirts?  because we want a t-shirt that wicks moisture and doesn't stink, plain and simple.  but we demand that the wool be of high enough quality and fine enough that it doesn't itch.  these base layers by minus33 tick all those boxes.  great product.  for some reason, your minus33 t-shirt might not look exactly like in the pictures.  one of mine has a logo on the breast, for example, and another one has cloth tags instead of leather tags.  oh well, i don't care about that, but just be aware of it.as for performance, i've taken these shirts on treks across three continents, through the desert and freezing mountains.  i highly recommend them for all the above reasons.  easy five stars.note:  hand wash these with woolite or machine wash gentle cycle.
40454	i bought this watch for my husband last xmas, and i must say it was gorgeous!  it looks very expensive and well made.  my husband didn't really care for it though, because the face was way too big.  it didn't seem that large when i opened the box to inspect it, but when he put it on his wrist, the face was extremely huge--i would say at least 3 inches wide. i know some guys like big watches like that, but my husband isn't one of them.  he had his last watch for 15 years and it was very conservative looking.  it's too bad because it's really cool looking watch otherwise.  if the face was smaller it would have been a keeper.  as for the wrist strap, it did look fairly short to me, but it did fit my husband.  i believe he had it on the second to last hole.  i think for an average sized or slightly large guy it would fit, but any guy who's very big boned may have a problem with it.even though i returned it, i would recommend this watch for any guy who likes extra large watches.  it's definitely worth the price!
40471	this little slip does a perfect job of giving some of the princess costumes (such aslittle adventures pink princess dressorcinderella princess dress-up costume) the 'pouf' they need to hang right and to provide the 'princessy' look little girls want. because the skirts on some costumes are very thin, it also adds another layer moms might be seeking to address any see-through issues their daughter's costume(s) might have. the extra layer would also provide a little more warmth for trick or treating in cooler climates.to clarify - this is a half slip (waist down) - something that isn't made entirely clear in the photo or description. it's decently made and soft - not scratchy. price seems reasonable (i paid $11). i might have been able to make it for less, but if i factor in my time, this is a bargain.slip is 100% polyester; machine wash; line dry.
40474	fine for adding fullness. it is long but could easily be cut with even regular scissors as this fabric would not require special know-how to make adjustments if necessary.
40538	it works and the form is very handy - what more can i say? my jewelry looks far better than it has in a long time!do read the label cautions and be sure to rinse well after using and before wearing your cleaned items.
40589	compared to what i have found in the stores, the prices is reasoable as well.  i rinse with a little soup and water so they are re-usable.
40613	it feels weird to order white tshirts from amazon, but here i am. after a few weeks, i'm glad i did. they feel comfortable and are well put together. them being tagless helps because tagged white tshirts sometimes scratch the back of my neck.quite honestly they are very comfortable. i wear them to sleep in and wear them underneath my dress shirts. if i need more t-shirts, i'd gladly get more of these. they are awesome.
40708	the product looks exactly like the provided picture.one of the little magnets fell out the first time i put it on.unfortunately i cannot find the magnet to put it back in.it does appear to be copper plated and not solid copper as described.it is quite heavy and does look quite nice. whether or not it hasany beneficial effects i don't yet know.it is probably a little overpriced for base metal, but it is a nice enoughlooking bracelet that i am not too upset.
40742	these are my go to sandals all summer. they are great for work or play or beach. i have all colors so i have a pair for anything i wear. which makes each pair last years at a time.
40765	i have a narrow foot with a narrow heel so i ordered a narrow width. this shoes fit well in length, but were too tight across the top of my feet.  the brown shoes looked kind of plain and drab.
40786	"these tights are very soft. they will fit her for a while to come; however, it's doubtful i will put her in them because after her very first wearing (only a few hours) they have a lot of ""piling"" on one leg, looks almost as if i should take a clothes shaver to them.....they look old and very worn now, very disappointing after she wore them for 2 hours to take pictures in, she hasn't even has the chance to wear them at ballet yet."
40805	this bra stands up!  i can understand some reviewers complaining about it, but it needs a 'break in' period.  i know that sounds silly, but once broken in, its the most comfortable bra you'll wear.  make sure you are properly sized first.  there is no elastic 'give' in the strap, so it will be tight at first.after about a week or two of wearing, it will become very comfortable as it forms to your body.  its now the first bra i reach for in the morning, as i now feel any other bra doesn't give that much support.  i do love how i never have to fiddle with the shoulder straps and the chest band doesn't stretch out as fast as cheaper bras would.its worth the money and the initial discomfort.
40870	i bought this watch for my mother, who has been having trouble discerning the hands on her tiny little lady's watch. this watch meets all her needs: it's small enough to be feminine, it's waterproof, and it's easily readable. she's thrilled, and so am i.
40893	it's so great that i have it in two different colors! the foam cup is very comfortable, and the lace is super appealing. i have ivory and black, and they both have three cute little pink bows on the front. love this bra!
40900	i bought the suzy snow and then the raspberry because it is so nice.  the fit is great (i'm a 32c) and the lining inside is just thick enough to keep you from looking cold and nothing else. it is supportive and comfortable.  basically perfect except the three sections do create lines under very tight-fitting clothing -- it is not a t-shirt bra.
40907	this bra from betsey johnson is all but comfortable. the fabric that makes this bra help you get the right support and it easy adjustable. it give the likes of the coobie strappy v-neck lace trim bras a run for its money as this bra is a must own.
40918	bought this for myself but ended up giving to my 16 year old daughter, she absolutely loved it!  it was very nice but i am not one that changes my jewlery a lot.  i would highly recommend the purchase of the black pearl heart.
40935	we are on our second bag (we travel a lot) and this is a very good product. it protects the stroller from all the dirt and grease in the cargo area. we have a peg pergo convertible car seat which fits easily into the bag, even with the brica airport travel wheels attached. this bag is easy to see when you're deplaning and has a large area for writing your name. i will continue to purchase replacements as needed, but our first one lasted about 20 flight legs.
40938	what i found out was: technically, the car seat should be checked at the counter and only strollers can be gate checked. if they lose your car seat the airlines has loaners. besides the jerk at the counter that wanted to check this even with only 20 people on the entire flight!, the string tightener broke after the first layover and the bag itself was ripped before we returned home. don't waste your money on any of these kind of products....and this was super bulky and inconvenient to carry. seriously, who designed this?fyi...the airlines will provide a free plastic bag to place your car seat in! use that.
41009	i purchase this because i love trueblood they dont stick well i lost one in the street the same day i put them on. not worth it. wish i could find good ones so i can finally take pics.
41084	i really struggled with this boot because of the sizing and the annoying issue of heel slippage that everyone also seems to be having. at first i bought my normal size and the heel slippage was very obvious and felt strange. i have never had a boot do that before. i researched it and some websites said heel slippage can be expected on a good quality pair of leather boots and you should expect for it to go eventually go away. however these felt so sloppy in the heel i exchanged them for a half size smaller.half size smaller i still had some heel slippage, and the main difference in feel is they were much tighter in the toe box. i decided to keep them anyway as they felt fine around the house. however their first 30 minute trip outside resulted in probably the worst blisters i have ever had in my life. i called every cobbler in town as i planned getting them stretched. however the very next time i put them on they felt much better and the break in process had already started.i would suggest getting what you feel is comfortable and know as with any good leather, you will have to break them in. but the payoff is they will be perfect for your own foot. most importantly, break them in with smooth kneesocks. they will be less likely to work themselves off of your foot, and thick cabling will really irritate your heel. do this and you will know why this boot is so fantastic and worth it.
41094	i have wanted a pair of fryes for awhile. had my eyes on veronica shorts, and when the cognac stonewashed were available in my size at less than half off, i made sure to snag a pair!  i loved them as soon as i opened the box.  this finish has a very worn look, as you can see in the pictures. my husband commented that they were &#34;used&#34; (haha!). but that's fine and what i expected - i intend to wear these as my usual every day footwear. i have small kids, go to the park, etc. so i tend to be hard on my shoes and it's nice to not have to &#34;worry&#34; about them. i waterproofed them and i think they'll be set for our michigan winter.as far as sizing, order your usual boot size.  my feet measure technically measure a 9.5 but i always wear a 10 in pretty much any shoe or boot, other than a sandal. so, i ordered a 10 as i normally would. they were a little snug when i put them on, but i knew from others that they would stretch and form to my foot. they did. if anything, i probably could have gone with a 9.5 since i don't wear socks.they are extremely comfortable. the footbed is quite cushioned and supportive. i could see myself wearing these for a long time, walking, etc. a very sturdy boot, a &#34;biker&#34; boot. they are heavy, a little bit heavier than any of my other boots. i like this feature. my 4 year old landed on my foot jumping out if the car and i barely noticed. the boots didn't, either. i have a feeling these boots will last for a long time.
41102	these socks are nothing out of the ordinary.  the material on the inside isn't that soft and i've found that the socks are actually a little small/tight (i wear shoe size 8.5 or 9).  the other socks that i like much better are the adidas variegated quarter sock, 3-pack.  the material is much softer and the toe seams aren't bulky.  also, the colors portrayed in the above photo are a little inaccurate.  the light blue is more of a deep turquoise and the light pink is really magenta.
41118	i keep buying adidas socks, hoping to find the same style i got when i about to go hiking in petra, jordan. i bought them in israel and haven't found the same ones anywhere else. they were exceptionally light, for the hot desert, and i keep hoping i will find some here in the u.s. to wear with sneakers in the hot summer.these are very soft and comfortable. i haven't had any problems with them at all. they fit beautifully.
41188	i wear the dockers d3 pants often and i figured i would buy the same size for shorts. i would advise people to buy the next size up. they are much tighter than the pants. the shorts are nice though. i like the quality and color options they have.
41212	i bought these for my husband and he wears them all the time.  very nice... good length & lots of pockets.
41256	"super comfy, easy on, easy off. keeps my toes nice and warm and dry! i can go stomping through puddles or snow drifts with no worries. they do tend to ""eat socks""...i.e. my socks end up slipping off my heel. that problem would be solved with longer socks most likely. the burgundy color is stunning. i got a half size larger than i normally wear and it's a perfect fit for wearing thick socks."
41284	i've only had these two days but they are a tight fit.  i've a narrow size 14 foot.  this is the first medium width boot i've ever found to be snug.  am not able to wear thick winter socks with this boot.  i can wear thin white cotton ones that allow my foot to slide easily into the boot.  after wearing them for a day they feel narrow in the toe and ball area of my foot.  my heel slides around a bit, less so i found towards the end of the day.my suggestion is to go to a store and try these on before you buy them.  i'm going to keep them as they are one of the few quality snow boots i've found short of my vasque sundowner hiking boots.  these are still better for slipping on and chasing down rover when he gets loose in the winter.  by the time i've laced my vasques hes long gone!i'll review more after the snow hits and i try these out on snow shoveling and walking about on icey driveways and sidewalks...best of luck!
41293	very cute, comfortable, breathable, and best of all no blisters. i like that the pink makes them super easy to keep my socks separate from my husbands, too.
41390	for running around the house or the neighborhood or the track; they rule.they play tough guy in the wash too.these don't get weakened or beat up by bleach or heat.hanes rocks in the socks department.
41409	these are just too small and slouch too soon. if you have 13+ feet, look at under armor or more expensive socks. you won't regret it.
41427	i wear size 9 shoes but these socks were still too long.  the package says size 6 and up.  i would say it's more like size 11 and up.
41662	i like this product because for me, it works as it was described. it is no miracle packing device that makes your clothes paper thin. it does, however, reduced the size of the load and leaves a good amount of room for other things. i like that it keeps clothes organized. during the test trial, i think i filled it too full. i was easily able to zip but not able to &#34;roll.&#34; so i just sat on it to get the air out =p i also noticed that the vents seem to keep the air out pretty well as i left it zipped over night. overall, a good product.
41695	this michael kors watch is well made, as expected, and a nice heavier weight watch. i had this on my wish list, and lucky me, got it as a gift! i didn't realize it had a mother-of-pearl looking face. the face looks white in the picture. i'm normally not at all a fan of pearl, and like a little more industrial, even masculine accessories, but i find myself loving the face of this watch. it adds to the high-end look and gives a hint of more detail without being gaudy. it also makes it a little more feminine. it is very easy to set the date on this watch. if you look closely, you can tell that the part of the band that touches the face is actually a solid piece and not separate pieces. at first, i didn't like this, i wanted the detail to be true, but after i got over it, i realize it's not very noticeable and probably lends to the stability of the watch band. overall, as are all michael kors items, this is beautiful, high-quality, and from the horses mouth- a wonderful gift!!
41770	these are really pretty.  i am super picky about my earrings, though, and these didn't make the cut.  i have way too hard a time getting the curved post into my ear, especially because it is thick and not tapered at all.  again, very nice earrings, but i would never wear them because i would end up with sore ears just from trying to put them on.
41811	i purchased these earrings for my mother for christmas and we are both very pleased with them. i found them to be a great bargain especially as a gift in addition to something else. she loves the way they look and that coupled with the gift card she got to a clothing retailer made her a very happy mom.they do look exactly like they appear on the site here so what you see is what you get and in this instance it's really worth it. they arrived in a small jewelry box inside a cloth bag which was great for wrapping! i would strongly recommend these earrings as a gift for any loved one.a perfect 5 out of 5!
41819	this bracelet is very pretty.  the garnets are nicely shaped with a clear hue to them.  i would caution potential buyers that the garnets have a rusty/red coloring, versus a pure red or ruby-like coloring.  the small diamonds in between the garnets are very small; so small that you can't really see them.  you mainly see the silver prongs holding the diamonds.  having said that, it is  still a lovely bracelet.  i purchased this on the lightning deal for $30, so overall, i believe this was a good buy for what i got.
41824	"i have purchased some overlay bracelets, and the overlay was obvious.  not the case here.  the sheen of the metal setting was very nice, perhaps because of the use of 18k gold.  this is quite a lovely bracelet and a super value.  the garnets used were of good size, deep color, with uniform placement.  the accent diamonds between each garnet were white to the eye and added genuine sparke. such a pretty, feminine piece!  the clasp was strong and appropriately sized.  just one of the ""gifts"" i have decided to keep for myself (ha!), this will definitely be the bracelet i wear for christmas!"
41862	when i first opened the box for this i was surprised, it didn't really seem my 'style'. it is a larger pendant, hanging from what was to me a confusingly twisted singapore chain.but, after wearing it... i love it. the weight of the chain and pendant are well balanced. the sparkle from the twisted chain pairs very well  the sparkle from the marcasites.the glass heart is a deep dark garnet 'red', (more of a rusted red), that while wearing is very opaque. but when held to the light reveals the filagreed pocked that it sits snugly in.though it's not the same as in the picture, (think darker), it's been a wonderfully versatile necklace that i love to wear.
41910	very nice necklace, at a very reasonable price. definitely does not look as inexpensive as it is.
41912	this is not a small pendant. true to the description, it's substantial in size (think silver dollar) without being weighty. the gold coloring is quite believable--it looks far more expensive than the actual cost. the piece is very, very well-made, unique and fun. mine did not arrive on a box chain, but rather on a thin curb chain. please note, the chain is not a significant issue as the pendant hangs nicely on a leather cord.since i create jewelry pieces in pearls and other natural gemstones as gifts, i decided to string this as the centerpiece of a turquoise beaded necklace. stunning! it will also work with citrine, lapis, freshwater pearls, coral, carnelian... there are limitless options. although the design is perfect for summertime fun, it isn't limited to one season; i remember at least one endless winter in the midwest where i craved bright sunlight. since gold and blue, red or purple compliment nicely, at this price, you could consider having a local bead shop string it with blue topaz, garnet or amethyst chips as a unique holiday gift!stand alone is nice, to... say... for the mother of the bride?
41977	"i've worn every brand of scrubs and these are incredible. i'm 5'9"" so they are at my waste but i wear a tee underneath.  they are so comfortable and they don't feel like a scrub top. the stretch sides make it wonderful to sit down. i love these. i have them in ten different styles."
41997	the fabric is as stiff as cardboard and the sizes run one size too small. the &#34;form flattering sides&#34; do not flatter does of us ( like myself ) that do not want to show off the love handles. the sides hug the handles and the stiff fabric doesn't give you any breathing room. i decided not to return it since i had tried it on after i had put on deodorant. i will not repeat that mistake with future purchases. i will try to lose weight in the new year and then i can wear this top.
42016	read about this as i prepare to sell some jewelry on ebay. it is everything that the 5 star reviewers say. even works great on select costume jewelry. great for getting the sunscreen residue off earrings, bracelets and necklaces. my rolex looks like it just came from the jeweler where i would have to spend $25 for a cleaning!
42025	super comfortable, no holes yet.  i really like these for work, warm yet they breath and just the right amount of padding for me.  i think they'll last a long time.
42081	this duffel does what it is suppose to do- hold clothing and personal items and it can be rolled or carried. the duffel lost a star because it only has zippered pockets on 1 side-could use a larger zippered pocket on the back side of the duffell. roll your clothes instead of folding them and this duffel will hold more clothing than you might expect. worth the $$.
42092	the bag itself is beautiful, seems well constructed and arrived just on time.  however, the problem was with the smell.  i don't know if it is a final spray of plasticizer, storage in a confined and not ventilated space, or what.  it sticks to high heaven when you get it.  i have set it out in the sun for hours, put in febreeze pads, sprayed with lysol.  finally, i have put in an air freshener.  it still smells bad.  i thought of sending it back, but i am continuing to try with this and another style of the same bag.
42117	i love my pink luggage! i love the idea of not having the normal color that is hard to identify on a luggage terminal. great price! wheels work. love, love, love it!
42131	i purchased this watch after comparing it and the easy reader in person.  i liked the look of this model better.  the dial is off-white rather than the stark white of the easy reader.  i do wish the hands were solid black instead of white edged in black but i can see them ok.  the date is tiny; i can't really read it.  it has a nifty feature to advance the date without twirling past midnight innumerable times.it is keeping good time.  the band fits me well and has a lot of holes so it would fit a wrist an inch bigger or smaller than mine.  (i think i'm average.) the band has a textured insert that is very attractive.  maybe it's packcloth.  it doesn't stand out a lot, just a nice detail.
42154	this is a beautiful bracelet in a lovely gift box and it looks far more expensive than the price you are paying. it makes a fantastic and economical gift for any female teacher.
42195	my husband love these.  very comfortable buy and i intend to get some more for him for the christmas holidays. only this time he says i should get him ankle socks. any suggestions?
42220	bought several of the various inexpensive timex watches for kids and this by far is the best of the bunch in terms of size.  if you have smaller ones who want a digital watch the band on this will fit better than some of the other larger timex watches.  the functions of the watch work well and are mostly intuitive if you've used a digital watch before.  highly recommended.
42226	my son loves his new watch. the watch glowing is really great - he is always pushing the button to make it glow at night in the car. i would have given the product 5 stars but it was very difficult to set the date.
42349	after reading most of the reviews for this watch i decided to purchase it.  i'm glad i did.  though the band is a bit stiff, with some manipulation and just wearing it will soften it up a bit.  i'm sure that with time it will get even softer.  the band is also made for an average wrist and is not too small.  i'm not sure if it is too large for a small lady's wrist, but from medium to even large it fits well.  the stay that holds the excess band in place after it is secured is one of those loose ones that will move around, but i rolled the excess band underneath it, which bulks up the excess band, and holds the stay in place.  the date on this watch is day only (not month), but it is really, really tiny and is hard to read.  the hour and minute hands are readily visible, although the second hand is very fine, but that's not really a problem if you're watching it to count seconds.  the indiglo light is pink and lights the dial very well in the dark.  i'm not a person who likes large watches, so i was a bit worried about this being one of the larger sizes that are stylish now. it isn't too large.  it is a nice mid-size; not too small, not too large.  i'm very happy with this watch.  it is a great casual watch.  i'm glad i bought it.
42359	great watch, great functionality, nice looks, bought and worn very carefully, stopped working after about 4  months (not a battery problem it turned out).i attributed it to bad luck and replaced it with another timex (the one with the vibrating alarm), and that one lasted even shorter. having had my share of timex troubles i switched to adidas sportwatches, and the one i bought is still working like a charm after almost a year.
42429	we have had two pairs of these now.  our five month old could wear the 6 month pair, though they just fit, so we ordered the 12 month pair with hope they would be more comfortable.  the 12 month pair was hard to get on and fell off easily.  for me the struggle was getting my son's small foot to go into the slipper which has next to no give or stretch.  we returned both pairs and ordered the more expensive zutano slippers.  they have snaps which make them so easy to put on as well as giving two options for the tightness around the ankle.5 month old is 29 inches and weighs 17 pounds.  he is tall for his age, which may haved played a part in the sizing being off, but in my opinion they are poorly designed for a tiny foot that doesnt point its toe or help put the slipper on.
42464	"this bra is very similar to the wacoal simple minimizer. it has just a little more ""ooomph""! i bought one in nude and one in black to replace the simple minimizer because i need a little more help during that time of the month. i retain a lot of fluid...in my boobs! it is true to size."
42523	"i have been a regular exerciser since 1996. heaven knows, i have owned many pairs of workout shoes in that time. typically workout shoes last me anywhere from three to six months, with a schedule of working out forty to sixty-five minutes a day, six to seven days a week consistently.  i've had many good pairs of shoes, and many awful ones. the best pairs of shoes i've owned (either for workout or wear-a-day) have always come from saucony. obviously, one cannot wear sneakers all the time in life, but i wear these when i can get away with it! not only are they designed to keep your feet breathing (thanks to the mesh upper in most of their designs), but they are always fashionable in looks, and feel good on from the second that they are taken out of the box.  very rarely have i ever experienced the need to ""break in"" saucony shoes. this is not true for the new balance brand with me, as a comparison in workout shoes. while initially saucony shoes can cost a bit more money than some other sneakers out there, this brand consistently tends to wear out much less quickly than others, at least in my case. workout shoes almost consistently follow the rule that you get what you pay for, especially if you have anything but a completely pain-free body, no injury history, and perfect feet.my stats (for you to compare your stats to mine, seeing how these shoes might work for you): i wear a size 11w, and this is my true size in every shoe that i have ever worn since i was a teenager. i have average-sized ankles for a full-figured woman; i'd say about they're about 10"" around.  i am plus-sized, so i require some padding in my shoes to keep my feet, joints, and lower back happy.  yet i am big enough that i definitely do not want extra heft in my shoe- and it can be tough to find the right shoe meeting those two conditions.  i have problems with under-pronating (supination)- evidenced by the fact that i always wear the outside tread of my shoes out before any other part of the tread.  i have an average instep, and my arches are basically normal, with a little bit of tendency towards flat feet (especially if i'm stuck wearing low-quality shoes, like for a friend's wedding...)my point is that i know if the shoes are right for me if they give me a spring in my step. these definitely achieve that goal! before i switched to supination-correcting shoes, i had really given up on high-intensity exercise. but i do brisk walking, aerobics (both floor and step), plyometric exercises (jumps and high-impact moves, but in moderation), light-to-moderate strength-training, lots of floor-based exercises for the abdominals/core/spinal erector/glutes/hips/thighs/, some pilates, some yoga, and lots of athletic stretches.  so in other words, i need a combination of stability and flexibility in my shoes. i need something that will flex when i do lunges, but won't make me wobble when i require extra balance, such as when i'm doing high-step aerobics. this shoe is amazing in that it allows for both of these requirements to be met! and they are lightweight. honestly, it's like ""barefoot, but better"". i never feel like these shoes are ""in my way"", adding weight and too much motion control to get full range-of-motion in exercises. for the daily exerciser, they know how important this is!they are also great as day-to-day shoes. i walk so much faster in them than i do even my other sneakers. i spent an eight-hour day recently touring nw washington, d.c. (mostly on foot), pounding the concrete as i toured the city, climbing steps to get in, on, and out of the metro a zillion times.  i took the long trip past the navy's memorial fountain, the national lawn, walking up the national gallery steps and around its marble floors towards the end of the day. yet i felt great all day and into the night, and had no fatigue or pain the next day, either! i had very severe knee problems at one point, and i can tell you that these are fantastic if you have those problems in your history.a hint that may help in doing exercise shoe-shopping: do not automatically buy shoes labeled for flat feet or high arches, if you have either of those problems. instead, look at the tread of a pair of your well-worn shoes. if they are shoes related to the activity you're buying a new pair for, all the better.  my tip is to remember that your arch type is only a part of the equation in shoe-shopping.  if you wear out the inner tread of shoes, then you'll likely need motion control to move more safely, and will probably need a shoe designed for over-pronators. but here's the thing to watch out for...many times it is the standard recommendation to buy shoes for over-pronation automatically, if one has flat feet. i took that advice for years at face value, and doing so slowed down my workouts, and was hard on my knees and back. i was doing the exact opposite of what i needed, as despite being flat-footed to a degree, i am actually a supinator. the tread on my shoes was the clue. (although it must be stated that i've regained my arches significantly through losing a lot of weight and by doing exercises/stretches to strengthen and regain normal arches.) while supination is allegedly more common in people with high arches and/or very high insteps, don't automatically assume that you need the kind of motion control which shoes for over-pronators are often designed for. regardless of your type of foot- look at the tread. everything starts with the feet- the wrong shoes lead to ankle, knee, back, and foot problems. no one needs more wear and tear on their body! :)once i addressed my true issue- supination- i finally found the shoes that give me the spring in my step needed! i could finally do the high-impact aerobics, running in place, jumping jacks, deeper lunges, deeper squats, tall-box climbs, and plyometric jumps without feeling pain in the knees and/or lower back.  it was also more comfortable for my feet.  if you do the type of workouts that i do, you probably need a shoe with a lot of flexibility- almost like being barefoot- but cannot take the ""barefoot shoes"" currently in vogue due to high-impact movements. some people do well with the ""barefoot shoes"", but my shoe size, body type, and level of physical activity make wearing those type of shoes less-than-ideal. so this sneaker is a godsend to me! i love to exercise, and these make that easier and more enjoyable. saucony excels in giving me a flexible, supportive, strong shoe with good looks, and just enough motion control that i never feel like i'm losing my balance in them. it was so important to my body, that it actually lessened the fatigue i felt post-workout to invest in these shoes! i work harder than ever in my workouts, but experience far less achiness from my workouts since wearing these shoes. they are truly awesome! i hope that anyone who buys these has the same wonderful experience with them.to the saucony co.- please expand your availability of this shoe in the various colors for ladies like me with wide feet!  11w is now a very common shoe size. i would buy a pair of these in every color if i could, but you only make one color available to me in that size. and keep your best shoes (like these!) available for purchase.  please don't change these- they rock!"
42602	"very bad item!!!! shoes is made of smelly fabric. made in china of bad qualityfor return you have to pay and size doesn't mach, way too small.my size is 6.5 - so i get 7 and it was too tight for one foot but for another too loose.  no half  a sizes  - not comfy at all  - i like to wear high heels - but this one is so cheep made -you going to brake you head.i am from ohio and same happens with me.......i purchased the black pu pair last week and when i received them i was very disappointed. the picture makes the shoes look shiny, like patent leather. i saw the patent version and didn't see any difference so i just picked one. well i was not a fan so i called customer service.very odd system. no one answered and was told to leave a message. about an hr or so later i got a call from the company. erica asked me what was wrong and i told her. then she said ""well you ordered the pu which is what you got. that is not our fault"". explained that i had no idea what pu meant (because there is no explaination of the company's color code anywere on the site). she then rudely stated it means polyurathane, like i was an idiot for not knowing that. very snotty so i decided to return them instead of exchanging because i will not deal with rudeness.so i got an email about returning them and again, very rude and unprofessional. again blaming me for not knowing their codes or for not seeing the subtle shine difference. and i have to pay a 20% restocking fee. horrible company and horrible experience. will be purchasing shoes from reputable companies instead of this joke of one."
42666	the band adjuster broke the first time i used it. and all the other tools are made of cheap materials. the only tool in this kit that is any good is the tool that slides between the watch band and the watch case to remove the pin that holds the band on.
42823	great socks for those who want a sock that feels great under sneakers or under casual shoes.  they feel as great as they look.
42957	"i found some previous comments to be true, the material is extremely soft, and feels great when just feeling it, but for briefs, it's a little too soft.  this causes the ""legs"" to ride up so that it fits much more like a sport brief (like a bikini speedo) rather than like a trunk or boxer brief.  also looks kind of funny, like it's half way between a trunk and bikini sport brief. the ""legs"" will not stay down where they belong after the slightest movement.  the good parts - i slept in it.  if a brief is too tight in the waist, or not supportive enough, or way too tight on the ""package"", i can't go to sleep or stay asleep when wearing it, and i slept well in this, all night without having to get up in the middle of the night to rip it off.  the waist is at a good height, not as low as it looks in the pictures, but definitely still at a fashionable and very comfortable height which works well under snug fit jeans. the pouch configuration feels pretty good at first, but is a little small and allows edges of the sac to get pinched at the edge of the pouch when worn under jeans (i am not above average size in this department). the width of the elastic waist is nice, they did that part right.  i'll occasionally enjoy wearing this one, but won't be buying any more.  i don't think it's worth the price.i have recently gone on a ""hunt"" for the most comfortable underwear, buying several briefs, boxer-briefs, and compression shorts, and to date, my all time favorite underwear is sold on amazon as a swimsuit but it's 90% brief underwear and only 10% swimsuit, it's the  ""men's bikini swimsuit platinum sport"" and the price is pretty good compared to just about anything else found on amazon.  i was clued onto it by some of the reviews ""complaining"" it was more like underwear than swim wear, and i, therefore, purchased it for use as underwear and am very happy with it."
42958	these are so comfortable, thought i would never get out of my boxer briefs but have 5 pair of these now and love the feel, so confortable. my gf also loves me in them,
42994	anyone who needs outdoor waterproof comfortable boots will be more than pleased with these bogs men's classic mid  boot. i wear my bogs boots very often for work and recreation and can verify that they go on easy, fit extremely well and are very durable. i researched boots online and when i saw these neoprene boots with the unique tread i knew that this was the boot for this maine outdoorsman. the tread is very sure footed in about every outdoor condition: be it mud, snow, slush, crap or crud. ice is a different cookie so get creepers. if you want an excellent neoprene boot with a superior footing please take my advise and buy yourself the bogs boots! i am sure that you will be very pleased.
43069	what can i say! it's okay to treat yourself and give a gift at the same time! ** ***** ** **** *** ***** ** ******  **** ** ** **** ***** ***** *** ***
43096	i wear a size 10 to 101/2 so i ordered a 11. they fit perfectly. they seam to have a quality build but only time will tell. they feel very nice on the feet but could have just a little more cushioning on the botttom. i am however a very picky person but am happy with these. they could be a little cheaper also. i paid $30...thinking at $22 would be more fair.
43101	started out good, but cushioning does not hold up, all of the cushioning basically is completely crushed after less than one year of light use.
43143	this ring looks pretty in the picture but in person the stone is very light, almost white, and looks very cheap. i would not recommend this ring.
43183	inserts are clear and fuller at the bottom. they do fit well into triangle top swimwear and are great in low plunge bras if you need to compensate for a size difference. good for daily wear, no reaction on my sensitive skin. highly recommended. care and feeding: wash with mild soap, warm water and pat dry.
43207	i really adore this piece, which has been sitting on my amazon wish list for over six months.  i got it for christmas!i really can't say enough about this piece.  i disagree with other reviewers who say that it is too small or cheap looking.  i think the gold color is just right and if it were any bigger, it would be uncomfortable and chunky--which is not the vintage style of this necklace.i agree that i found it difficult to put photos in it--however, as anyone who has ever owned a locket before knows, it's always difficult.i think this piece hangs beautifully (just below the breasts) and looks charming and simplistic.  i highly recommend this necklace.  it's one of my very favorite pieces in my collection. and it's easy to pair with any outfit.  i wear it with tights and a tunic or a high neck dress.  it's very versatile.
43240	i am usually wary about ordering shirts i haven't tried on first for the usual reasons. i have been pleasantly surprised by this one.... the fit is true to the sizes listed, the fabric is very soft, and the words are clear and easy to read. oh yeah - i had no idea how many secret firefly fans were lurking in our little town until i wore it to the grocery the first time!
43247	"while the title of this item says ""size 2t to 4t"", the actual item says ""for children 1 to 2 years old"".  the seller refuses to correct the description, so you've been warned."
43250	i was skeptical about this working, but after trying this on several pairs of shoes by first spraying the shoes and then wearing them - it actually works. thank you.
43267	this is about my 6th kipling bag.  i've a cosmetic case, a wallet and more purses.  love them all.  bright, vibrant colors.  lots of compartments with zippers, built in key fobs, and the best part long straps and lightweight fabric.  i hate toting a heavy purse...the things you put in are heavy enough -- why start out with a heavy empty purse?  these are my spring/summer bags.  material can stand up well; stains come off easily.  and i get a lot of comments on the kipling gorilla, which comes with every purchase. cute gimmick, for a good product that really doesn't even need a gimmick.
43276	my husband is a vet and wears both scrubs and a doctor's coat.  i normally purchase them through catalogs and decided to try amazon. com this time. this coat is very heavy material and good quality construction.  it has been washed numerous times already and comes out of the dryer looking great (hang it up while it's warm though).  this coat was of higher quality and was half the price of the catalogs.  will buy again.
43297	i bought this jacket for work and it is really cute and professional. i highly recommend this product. i bought an xs and it is very true to size.
43317	great shirt for warmer weather. fits well. i love russell products.  seems to be well made.  good quality for the price.
43331	when i washed then the logos on the pants washed off!! they are very comfy and are light weight great for summer or a workout
43332	"i really appreciate that this is sold in a ""tall"" size.  fits me perfectly.  not fancy by any means, but if you want a simple comfortable sweat pants, this will make you happy."
43426	this is one of my all time favorite bras. when in doubt, this is the bra i turn to. i like trying new ones, but this one is my go to always. it is comfortable and adds a little more lift with the bottom padding without it being too much.
43464	this is my second pair. i won't say they're perfect, (i don't believe in &#34;perfect&#34;) but they sure work in japan's rainy (muddy) season. my first pair is about 3 years old, and kind of scuffed up for dressy, hence the new pair
43475	i bought these for my daughter who just became a medical student. she was told she needed to replace her black running shoes with stain resistant white ones. not what she wanted fashion-wise and when we went shopping she couldn't find anything she liked and thought were comfortable. i ordered these in an attempt to meet the requirement in the interim. when they arrived my daughter absolutely loved them. she said they look good and they are extremely comfortable. did i mention she is 6-months pregnant so being on her feet is tough on her?
43477	i love skechers but these were a huge disappointment. they hurt my feet and never stretched out. they had some awful pressure points that constantly caused blisters.
43503	love it, love it, love it.  this watch surpassed all expectation.  my daughter loves it.  i am going to get one for myself.
43507	extremely well made and absolutely gorgeous watch. glad i purchased it. thinking about also buying the white band watch, same style, round face. it very pretty too.
43569	this was way too big for me and very cheap. i sent it back. also, it doesn't come with the stockings as pictured.
43597	great fits well not too tight. ... .... .... .. love the pockets n sleeves, i like the cuff ends instead of regular elastic
43666	we buy these two brands on amazon.  my wife has 3 pairs of vistana, i have 2.  this is my wife's second pair of cocoons, and my first. the first pair she purchased was too small to comfortably go over her small frames.  they may seem expensive, but we didn't want to continue buying prescription sunglasses, and constantly switch in light and dark settings.  i'd recommend buying a larger size than you think you need, especially for coccons, as they wrap around the sides.  they could hit your prescription eyeware. they can scratch.  my wife takes great care of hers (always in a case).  i am rougher, but the glasses can handle it.my wife has small frames, but orders the large size.  i have medium frames, and need extra large.
43677	i wear these over my yoga pants to and from the gym.  they keep me warm!  very cute and they wash well.
43758	the color, size, and design all makes these pants the best.  very comfortable even on a 12 hour shift.  i recommend these pants to anyone.
43764	these scrub pants are perfect for tall and plus sized women. i have a hard time finding scrubs that are long enough that come in my size, and these are the perfect length and comfy.
43789	v neck i have attempted to wear and fruit of the loom wasn't much better - they were, tight in the shoulders and chest, and itchy; scratchy, rubbing at the v stitching in the front. what say you about these?  doublju
43798	"these hanes v neck t shirts are very comfortable; the smooth, 100% cotton is preshrunk for a great fit the first time you wear them. moreover, the back inside of the shirt has no tag that could feel scratchy on the lower part of your neck. the information that used to be on the tag is now imprinted onto the rear inside of the shirt.in addition, the double ply neckband makes the garment stronger than ever so it lasts longer then ever! the shirt stays tucked into your pants, pajamas or underwear shorts very well since its length comes slightly longer than the typical length. the shirts even come three to a pack for added value--great!just a few extra words of advice based on my experience: i would wash these before wearing them even thought they are pre-shrunk. sometimes the shirts come out of the plastic bag package with a very, very slight funky smell that must occur because they were packed the way they were. in addition, check both the sizing chart above on the webpage and the ""pricing and availability"" chart to make sure that you choose the right size for you. i would also wash these t shirts with similar colors to minimize the chances of any colors bleeding onto these t shirts during the wash cycle.overall, these long lasting t shirts by hanes make for great underwear; they could be worn outside but their real purpose is underwear for gentlemen. these shirts last forever, especially with the proper care. get some and wear them in good health!"
43852	this is the most adorable coin purse, and it's the perfect item for a hamster-loving friend. it's not leather, but a wrinkle-finish recycled material. toss it in with another gift -- it's just about the price of a greeting card! the size is good for credit cards, a few folded bills and change.don't look for any great durability here. it's more a novelty item than anything else.
43886	i ordered the large, they are a 37&#34; x 32&#34; long, size.they are a very nylon-y material, probably good if you're an intern or nurse, not great for around the house wear.washing them neither softened nor shrank them, they do have a draw-string waist to take-up the extra size but i'll haveto hem them.
43890	true top color and very comfortable, of course dickie always dide make good products and i will end up ordering more in the future
43891	i ordered these in large, and they fit heaps better than the unisex 'large' dickies scrubs. they still run a little big, kind of baggy, but overall not that bad. i needed them for an anatomy lab class and they are just what i was looking for. they fit great over a pair of jeans so that i can just take them off after class and go about my day without an entire change of wardrobe.
43931	i ordered this caesar costume to host a party. i am a completely normal built man at 5'11&#34; and weighing 190 lbs. (i have a fifteen pound gut that needs to depart soon). i normally wear size 42 regular jackets in the usa, with size 34 pants. getting this costume to fit required several pinnings. the belt was way too large for my waist and the shroud was too long and would not stay set in the loose belt. the material was some cheap scratchy synthetic fiber and overall the costume was pretty cheaply made (at least for $30).  it was also fairly hot and did not breathe at all.in all honesty, i have a feeling this was sized in some overseas factory by some manager who has no idea how americans are built (and i dont mean just the obesity crisis). overall, if you dont mind spending thirty minutes pinning the costume to make it fit better before the party, it will work fine, but it is not high quality.
43972	these did not work well for my body type. i have a little larger hands and arms then the model used, yet that are way too tight and don't look good at all.  the should have a larger size, that would be better rather than one size
44029	planned on sending it back, but didn't do it in time. i am a 36ddd gal, and it is challenging to find a fit. this was so-so... the back has a cut out which means it has less support, but i liked that it does not have that seam under the bust line, so that the top or it fits me like pasties.... it was not bad, but for me, not so good-- buy small, it stretches a lot.
44034	"it looks a little cheap though. it's super long too i have to pull it up for it to look right on. (i'm 5'7 & 34c; and wear a 6 dress size) it comes to my knees. maybe it'll shrink with washing.""new edit""- husband loves it. haha. and it does shrink...so just get it. it stretches...don't worry if you're a bigger gal, it'll work for ya :)"
44039	sexy, sleek, and the thong is a perfect compliment.  no cotton patch in the underwear, but they probably won't be on long enough to make much of a difference.  not something my wife will be wearing as an all-day comfort item, anyways lol.
44053	i bought a pair of these for international flights i go on.  i had tried a pair of $10 cheapies for compression sox that worked, but they constantly had to be pulled up which is a hassle when you have jeans on as you can imagine.  these are excellent quality sox!  they stay up easily and they have enough compression for those 23 hour flights to asia.since i'm over 200 lbs. now and average height, i was worried about them fitting--but they are fantastic.great product so give it serious consideration.  i love them!
44062	my husband wore his socks on our recent plane trip.  they really compress, but he said they were comfortable.  we are planning a much longer plane ride, so we will both wear ours.  for compression socks they fit well and certainly compress.
44089	i wanted a comfortable pair of boots that i could wear with slacks in the office, and these fit the bill!  i walk a lot, and often walk to another office about 3/4 of a mile away, and i can do that without discomfort, thanks to these!  and they look very classy to &#34;boot&#34;.  :)
44103	i prefer to wear kilts all the time.  this looks good on my formal kilts.  it adds class.  leather belts to attach it to are easy to find.
44169	i purchased the j&m; melton's five months ago.  for the price they are one of the better dress shoes available.i purchased in my typical size, 11d, and they fit as expected.  when compared to allen edmonds shoes like the strand that i own the fit is very similar.  also good quality of the leather and the craftsmanship.  the classic cap toe will never go out of style.  the biggest plus for these shoes is that they have a lot of the qualities you would expect in a much more expensive shoe for less than half of the price.a few things to note:the other reviewers are correct that these shoes will take some breaking in.  they are much stiffer than allen edmonds.  i don't wear these shoes all that often (probably once every other week) and there is still some work to do.the leather is very shiny.  this could be a pro or con depending on what you are looking for.  for me they would look odd to wear with anything other than a suit.  not great for jeans or chinos.  but on the positive side they are formal enough that you could rock them with a tux if needed and they would not appear out of place.overall, these are a good quality shoe for the price.  i would recommend to anyone that they spend their money on these rather than buying a cheaper throwaway shoe (and they don't want to drop over $300 on the ae park aves).
44193	very good watch and seems to live up to seller's claims.  my only disappointment was the size.  i acutally expected it to be larger, although it's a good size.
44218	i ordered a large due to the reviews i read about this costume. i have to say that the material i despise. the skirt is too big for me and too long. i am 5'9&#34; 38c wear size large or sometimes xlarge in shirts and in jeans 13-14 and shoe size is 10-11. i am very curvy and thick and i weigh 215 lbs even though i don't look like it since i'm athletic. people might say that i look like i weigh 180; thus, the large fit me loose. the upper body part fit perfect since my breasted filled the cup area, but the skirt is too long and big. the skirt is made from this stretchy metallic material and the whole costume doesn't look like the picture displayed. the headbands and slip on boot covers fit me well. the cape on the other hand is too small and its made from the same material as the skirt. the cape didn't fit my neck properly it will fit someone who's a size smaller. the hand cuffs are way too small and didn't fit halfways. and finally the belt is made from the same metallic stretchy material as the skirt but it doesn't look that great. with the velvet material the upper body part is made of the belt slips up or twists and it doesn't hold in place. overall probably it will be a good costume for a child but not for an adult. instead of making me look sexy it made me look sloppy. i was hoping i would look like the girl in the picture since i almost have the same features as wonder woman but its a shame that the skirt makes you look unattractive.
44228	been in the navy for many (many) years, as a logistics guru, and everything we do is tracked by the julian date - and this is the first watch i had ever come across that actually displays the julian date!!!  so, that was the primary reason i purchased the watch - for the julian date feature.  in addition, i travel, alot, and the world time feature is efficent and easy to use.  and, it's a g-shock (takes a beating).
44241	comfortable right out of the box. exceptional style (multiple compliments the first day i wore them). versatile clothing options with the brown/black combination.
44244	received the shoes and i am disappointed with the shoes.  they are not comfortable.  being j & m i expected more,  the side ot the shoe cuts into you ankle bone causing pain..
44266	great for anyone who spends a lot of time outdoors. we enjoy camping in the winter and these come in very handy! i'd recommend them for sure!!
44296	this is a spooky mask, that is also very cool. this thing looks awesome. my wife is freaked out by it, which makes it all the more enjoyable. i'm looking forward to wearing it outside late at night and allowing the neighbors to catch a peek of me.
44316	i purchased this coat for my daughter, and amazon offered the best price that i could find even searching the internet (including ebay).it was exactly what we were looking for, and it will see a lot of wear.  it is warm and the color (brown) is beautiful.
44321	well it's nice but nothing to write home about . material seems a little plastic, heavy, fits the size exactly
44330	i love the color the warmth and the weight. my one complaint is that i am hippie and it rides up. i even had my coworker embroider my name on it so no one could steal it.
44336	i normally have a hard time finding a good cheap pair of sunglasses, but was extremely happy with these. comes in a nice little pouch for the shades, the glasses fit well, they're very reflective (mirrored), and sufficiently dark. very pleased!
44351	i'm a plus sized lady so it's difficult for me to find lingerie that fits well and looks good, this does both.  my fiance loved them.  the material is a little scratchy, but they were still comfortable.
44374	the origional watch wrench had a miner issue, immediately upon notification to the supplier, it was immediately replaced.  the replacement unit works perfiectly. the wrench is the perfect tool for the removal of a screw on watch back. this is three point engagement, with six different sets of engagement points, should enguage most screw type watch backs.  i would recomment both the tool and the supplier and would purchase from this supplier again.
44380	i've already changed 3 watch batteries using the se 88 watch wrench. it woks like a charm and makes changing batteries on different sized watches easy.
44389	i bought three of these at once and saved some money on the shipping charge. the leather quality is only average, but the more i use it, the more i like it. the fact that it can hold 11 credit cards or other types of cards is important. a windowed slot is perfect for your driver's license. everything fits snugly so that even if you hold this wallet upside down, nothing will fall out. the zipper is useful when you absolutely want to make sure things stay in. this is a no-nonsense wallet. if you want ultra soft, name brand wallet, you would have to pay 3 to 5 times the price of this wallet. highly recommended! this wallet is large (4.375 x 5.125 inches) so make sure this is the size you want.
44419	received on time.  the quality appears good and it holds a lot of credit/other cards.  i have 16 credit/debit/rebate/gift cards in it plus drivers license and a couple other items.  it remains much thinner than my old wallet.  if you're concerned about pickpockets, it does not allow you to button the hip pocket on dockers type pants.  most of my dress pants are ok, but it is a little taller than a typical wallet.  more the fault of the pants maker because the extra height allows it to be thinner.
44422	i agree w/earlier review by bao.  item isn't durable. the pockets are a too tight making insertion and removal of credit cards difficult. on most of my cards i needed to trim off 1/8 of a inch on one side. after one year, my first one had its inner liner (nylon?)came loose. i'm on the second wallet and it is exactly just as tight with the pockets.why do i like it you might ask? color, texture of the soft leather, number of pockets and size (hip hugger)to list a few. the good outweighs the bad and with the reasonable price i'll get another one next year if need be.
44464	returned it cause it was way too small. ordered 3 other types of bras in same sizing and kept those, but not this one. if you order, order bigger.
44483	i've been wearing this bra for the last couple years. there's nothing negative that i can really say about this bra. it's soft, doesn't scratch, doesn't leave red marks, is light weight and barely noticable. i live in a warm humid climate and have had no issues with it either. it gives a natural shape under tops and the beige doesn't show through light colored tops. i'm a smaller busted woman and this gives me fine support, with the right amount of coverage without looking fake or feeling as if i'm trying to be something i'm not. as far as washing them goes; i always wash my bras in a lingerie bag, using woolite, and on the gentle cycle. i never put them in the dryer because the heat ruins elastic. i've never had an issue with the durability of my bras by using this method. wireless doesn't get much better than this. i'd recommend to anyone.
44533	really nice pair of socks; fit well, looked good, performed well. shipping was prompt. price at $10 per pair was too high (con't think of any sock worth $10/pair). i thought i was ordering a 2-3 pack, but it was only one pair...oops, guess i need to read descriptions more carefully. good product, but very expensive.
44587	these are gay yet hard-working rain boots, with their cheery bright-red color and solid construction.  the price i paid (about $30) was well worth if for such quality.  the boots are a bit stiff, necessitating a modified technique for mounting and descending stairs, but they do the trick: rain and mud stay out.  i anticipate that they will last for many years.
44604	these slippers are not worth $30, but at the discounted price of $15 they are a bargain. the inside is as soft as the outside looks. they are not fuzzy inside, they're smooth, but really soft. they are light weight, easy to slip into and the bottoms are just thick enough to mask any lumpy surfaces you might be walking on. the rubber soles are perfect for grabbing the mail or newspaper, or even for wearing to the market. originally i was just going to use these as slippers to slip into quickly at night when i got out of bed to check on the baby, but they are so soft and comfortable i wind up wearing them all morning. my feel don't get sweaty in them, but they do keep my feet warm. i'm really sensitive to little balls that develop in most slippers, or tags, or if the slipper isn't really soft. some slippers even give me blisters on the top of my toes from the faux fur that isn't very soft (sensitive due to previous illness) but these are really nice feeling. they aren't as heavy as some of my previous acorn slippers, more like an extra nice deerform type. at the discounted price, i'd definitely buy these again.
44693	i use these are shower flip flops so i havent the experience of putting these through the rigors of daily life, but so far so good.  they are thick, comfy, feel durable, and they dry out within 24 hours with no wierd odors.  the one dowsize i found is the sizing.  i ordered a size up like everyone suggested and they are still a bit too tight.  i ordered 3 pairs so maybe i shoulda ordered one first and then ordered the next sizes, but whatever, they work great.
44764	"i purchased these slippers to replace another sheepskin pair that just were not comfortable.  when the tamarac pair arrived, i was impressed by the stitching, the sturdy and substantial rubber sole, the lovely and uniform suede color and texture, and the extremely thick sheepskin.  as i slid my foot into the first slipper, i noticed a little stiff ""something"" along the inner edge.  same with the second slipper.  it's a tag which i've since snipped away from the seam, thereby eliminating the only tad of discomfort or disappointment in these slippers.  i wear a size 7.5 shoe and the size 8 slippers are perfect, snug as i like my slippers because they always stretch out over time and miles.  i don't think these will be sliding off my feet as many other slippers tend to do with wear.  as on the sheep, the fleece is not perfectly uniform and this at first bothered me on one slipper, but as i wear them, i care not about that little single spot of less than perfection.  since i'm wearing these around my home and comfort is my priority, these are a winner.  best of all, my feet are so warm for a change."
44797	i ended up returning these earrings to amazon as they were very small and did not seem worth the money and did not look good on me. i wanted larger earrings.
44840	can't believe how much this hat complete my pirate look for this coming halloween! i searched all over the internet, compared prices to prices, and i have to say, amazon is the best place to find the cheapest deal for this hat!
44875	i love this hat, it's soft, comfortable and fits many different size heads. my only complaint is that the lace isn't starched to stay sticking up, instead it is soft and foods over, so i had to starch mine.
44876	great hat to go with the swashbucker's costume.  just had to poof it up a bit and iron the ribbons.  great price.  looks fab!
44909	i was excited to receive these jeans based on other positive reviews. they are duds, though. i must be less curvy than i thought, because these are slightly tight in the waist (and i have a weirdly small waist) and much too large in butt/thighs. they're also too short, and i was annoyed by this since i asked amazon chat the length and was told 32 inches. no. they're maybe 30. i'll wear them to garden, etc. but they won't be in my normal rotation. wish i would have tried them on in the store before purchasing.
44922	being a woman of a certain age, i don't always know what looks good on me anymore, what fit might be too young, too old, etc.these jeans are perfect! they are as comfortable as boyfriend jeans, and very flattering to my curvy shape and mom hips.i love them!
44931	these are very dark and very beautiful.  they are classic with a twist and unique as not a lot of people have black pearl jewelry.
44972	i chose this rating because they are comfortable, stylish, and i like them. the cost is easy on the pocket book.
45061	the pink color is more lavender pink than peach pink. it has a more grayish hue than the picture. the semi-round shape is accurate. not a perfect round.  gold posts are nice. the backing is secure. price is great. just disappointed in the color.
45077	for the price and service i would purchase them again. my wife loved them and she asked me were i got them and i told her a jewelry store in town...jejeje way to go amazon!
45146	this is a sturdy and reliable luggage set. the large suitcase is really a medium size i'd say. it is not enough to pack two adults in. this luggage set isn't for a family or really a couple. it's a one person set or one adult and one child. the duffel is a great size!  the second to smallest bag is an excellent carry on or snack bag and the smallest bag is essentially just a toiletry bag. for the price this is really an unbeatable set.  i'd very much recommend some tsa locks because the ones that come are worthless.
45258	thought it was too good to be true. would not recommend this product to anyone. cheaply put together. i thought it would be more comfortable but it actually does cup the breast but it feels like a girgle.
45324	i have several other glamorise bras in the same size that fit perfectly. i was hoping to find a black wire-free bra to wear under black tops this summer, and there aren't many to choose from. a front closure style is not one i would normally go with, but seemed to be one of the only options. i ordered my normal size, only to find out that i could barely even get the bottom clip closed. at that point i did not even try to close it, just gave up. also, it has next to nothing in the way of lining, to add a touch of modesty in cold environments if you know what i mean. it just did not work out for me and i am returning it. if you are going to try it out yourself, i would suggest ordering a size or two larger than your normal band size.
45325	this bra would get 5 stars if the size was reliable-  warned that they were sized small.  so i ordered one size larger, and almost didn't get it on.  when i did though, it felt pretty good.  it's tight enough to prevent chafing.  i thought i might feel strangled, but i slept in it twice without discomfort.  it isn't as stretchy as other sleep bras, but that gives it support for my busty, over weight, chest.  i'm 5 ft tall and chunky, and the shoulder straps were just right.  a taller person may not get as good a fit with just one size up.  if you're on the border of a size, i'd say go up two sizes.
45331	i wanted this to be comfortable so i bought it larger on purpose. it's so tight that it's almost unwearable. i am a 36dd and i got it in a 40 so that it would not be tight. fail.
45387	i really like this bra.  i wish i ordered a smaller size.  it stays up, but there is not that much support.  great price and it is a lot better than some of the strapless bras i've tried.
45417	i bought this for my daughter and ordered the size she normally wears. it fit bandwise -- but the cups stuck out on top.  it hooks on the front bottom with one clasp -- the rest of the front closure should go straight up, it doesn't it leans forward.  you could never wear this under a t-shirt.  it's gone in the goodwill pile.  it fit perfectly, if not for that feature.  and the front close feature was what she was looking for.
45454	it's my first front closure bra.  i was looking for a plunge bra.  with as large as i am the wires don't lay flat against my chest and poke my shirt.  otherwise i like the bra.
45488	i'm not sure i'd buy this bra again. it fits well except that it tends to gap on the sides because the fabric doesn't come up high enough for me. it is otherwise comfortable and the cup size fit is great. given it's many good features, i can't rate it poorly, but it's not my favorite glamorise bra.
45495	a very sturdy, quality shirt that wears the carhartt label with pride.  perhaps the only thing i don't like is that the tall version is really tall.  i don't normally like to tuck my shirt in, but if i don't with these, i feel like i am wearing a dress.
45522	the fabric has already come loose at one point, after very scant use. i'd return it but it's more trouble than it's worth. it's still usable.
45532	long johns.  that's what they are and they are made of good quality and warm cotton.  what else can i say.  long johns are long johns.  these are a good pair.
45535	i received these a few days ago and have worn them every time that i have been in the cold so far. i had not expected them to be so warm, and have found myself needing to get rid of a jacket on account of them. they're excellent.
45610	believe the sizing listed.  not many hats go to this size, but this one is indeed as listed. it arrived in great shape and has stayed looking good ever since.  i'd prefer a little nicer hatband, but that's something that can be changed. it was absolutely as represented and arrived on schedule. texture, shape, thickness, and weight are great. color is consistent throughout. will continue to look for this product line. pricing was exceptional vs. comparable hats. customer service was readily available, but an online search turned up the hint of using a bit of foam weather stripping in the lining if the hat was too large. (next size down would have been too small. and like it too much to part with it.) worked like a charm. very pleased overall.
45666	the image for the pink one is the brickhouse sling bag, and entirely different product. just make sure you know for sure what you are ordering.
45672	"i bought two of these for a trip to disney world. it was one of the best things i did in preparing for the trip in that it gave my girlfriend and me a very easy way to tote junk around and still get on all the attractions. all we had to do was sling them over our shoulders, and we could walk easily and keep our hands still relatively free. at least that's what i did. my girlfriend wore hers as a sort of modified fanny pack.we put to very good use the three zippered pockets in the main body of the pack. for me, the upper one contained sunglasses and a small camera. the main pocket was used for a rolled up windbreaker and sometimes a water bottle. and a smaller pocket outside the main compartment was used for maps, passes, keys, coins, and whatever other small items of junk we needed fast access to. i think the strap also had a small pocket for a cell phone or mp3 player, but i didn't need it.the sling pack worked absolutely beautifully. it resisted moisture every time we splashed down in one pool of water or another. the ""green"" color was more of a silvery blue-green that was very muted and attractive. the construction was fine, and hard use 16 hours a day was no problem. and the cost was outstanding.these are a real bargain. even if uou're just moseying down to the dock to watch the tide come in, this is a tote worth having!"
45689	after just one wash, the waist band stitching came loose and created a run of the thread on the entire circumference. i threw it away and to me, i'll never buy it again.
45696	one year ago, i purchased a set of champion athletic clothing knowing that the trademark was representing mid to high quality line of products.  having received the set, i was strongly dissatisfied with the quality and the cut of the champion set, giving approval rating of one star.  this time, i tried another brand, fruit of the loom, representing lower to mid quality range of clothing products.  checking out of this set, i can say that they are much better than expected from this manufacturer.specificaly, the pants both size medium, the champion legs longer, has rubber ties on the bottoms, both are pretty rugh, no pockets, not even one, the waist line is a common string.  comparably, the fruit of the loom has tailored legsdouble stiched, two pockets,  the waist line has a rubberized string.  i paid 65% of funds for the fruit of the loom pants compared to the champion pants, take your choice!!!!
45763	very good build quality, made of metal with 3 digit combination lock that is programmable.from factoy this is preset with 000 which you can see on window on edge opposite of locking claspif the lock has been opened by a tsa agent, the red wings come up so you know instantly if your luggage was searchedto lock, here is the procedure1) first test your lock - set combination to something other than 000 with lock in clasp2) then open by setting combination to 000 - you set this to window on edge (opposite side of locking clasp)3) once you know it works, then you open lock and turn metal locking lever 90 degrees so that it gets depressed into metal case.you will notice a little fin at bottom of metal locking lever, then you can turn it towards the window where you will set yournew combination. once you have set it, remember it or write it down.4) next turn metal locking lever back 90 degrees and then turn it counter clockwise (it only goes in one direction) two full timesso you pass locking clasp twice and put locking lever in clasp. then turn combination to something other than what you programmedand it will lock.5) turn combination on window on edge to your new programmed combination and it will opensimple, i bought six of these for my luggage.update 3/6/11 - this held up great with my trip over to india. one luggage piece was searched as i had a voltage converter in it and i could tell with the red plastic piece being extended that it was searched and had a tsa notice inside. just be careful the airline does not put a sticker over the combination, then it becomes extremely difficult to remove. kingfisher airlines did this and i had a job to remove the sticker to open the locks. great locks, buy them!
45770	i have been wearing this style of wigwam socks for several years and i do not find this current package to compare favorably.  just after the initial washing, there were loose strings on the edges of the sock.  the socks do not appear to be as thick as with previous pairs.
45792	i love these shoes.  i would wear them everyday if i could.  i had plantar fasciitis but after getting these shoes (and adding store bought inserts) it's now completely gone. (although, i also dropped about 20 lbs.)  i still wear them quite often and love them.  i would definitely buy another pair.  my only complaint is that they are huge.
45809	"so, this costume comes with the brown ""armor"" with the attached red cape, a white tunic for underneath which is kind of like a satin/silky sleep shirt for girls, two bicep circlets, two forearm bands, a headband, and 2 shin covers.for reference:  i am 5'9 and 170 lbs with an average-athletic build.  i am not a muscle-bound gym rat, nor am i overweight. i have a solid frame with decent muscle mass.  i bought the medium and the fit of the tunic and armor pieces is just right.issues:  the image makes it look like the front of the brown armor is a solid piece. it isn't.  it's more like a set of ribbons that hang down so when you move they swing and the white tunic underneath shows through.  also, the armor is only for the front.  the only thing covering your back end is the tunic and the cape.  the tunic ties in the back with a strip of fabric which seems like it will work well enough.  the bicep circlets are velcro fastened, so you have to awkwardly set them over your biceps.  they then either slip down because you flexed when you attached them or they constrict your arm when you do end up flexing.  there is no elastic to allow these to flex over your biceps as you move, it seems like i will not be able to use these as they will not stay in place.  the bands for the forearms are elastic and can be pulled to stay in place, but for my arms the taper is off and when the front part (towards the hand) is snug and in place, the back part (towards the elbow) is loose (oh well, it'll do).  the headband looks ok, but i never intended to wear it.  the leg pieces are also velcro fastened in 4 bands around the calf.  i tried them on and it looks like they will stay in place.  i have an average calf size but the bands are cut funny so that some are left with too much excess hanging off when fastened tightly, i will probably just use clear tape to keep them pinned down.all in all, it'll work, but wasn't exactly what i was hoping for, but i wasn't going to spend $150 on something more elaborate . . ."
45825	i have been wearing nb 844's for years.  most comfortable shoe i've ever owned.  nb discontinued the 844 and, based upon my comparison of features, appears to have replaced the 844 with the 926.  but as nice a shoe as the 926 is, imho it's just not as comfortable on my foot as the 844, nor does it look as nice. that said, it is a very comfortable shoe, well made and you won't go wrong buying if you can do so at a discount.
45827	"i have begun to shop for shoes at amazon since my local stores seem to always sell out of common sizes and i can only find size 7 or size 14 of anything i'd want to buy.these shoes are at the top end of what i would normally pay for shoes but they are among the most comfortable new balances i have owned. i have been buying new balance for a while because they fit well. different manufacturers always seem to fit a little different from each other but my experience with nb is they are consistent from one shoe to the next.i've been using these shoes for about a month. there wasn't hardly any break in period and they've held up quite well and still look almost new.the arch support is excellent and i get good traction even on wet industrial surfaces which is sometimes a problem with similar shoes.i don't believe too much in the marketing hype and ""features"". the shoe has words like ""abzorber"" and ""rollbar"" and the like. meh: it's a pair of shoes! they look like the picture. they're comfortable."
45839	it really keeps me warm. the size is just fine to me. i plan to buy more pants and tops. i bought through ny lingerie and it was a good experience with them. it took a few days to ship but once they ship, the delivery is fast. i will defintely buy from them again.
45899	this thermal is great. the sizing was true and it is well fitted. not bulky or baggy. but the torso is not very long... it is not at all as long as the photo makes it appear to be, making it difficult to tuck or keep tucked in.
45901	i'm a size 12 and i ordered a medium despite what some of the other reviewers said and i'm glad i did. i needed it to wear underneath other tops and the m fits me nice and snug without being too tight. a large would've been fine too i suppose but i wouldn't be able to wear any fitted clothing or t-shirts on top of that. the quality is great and i didn't feel sweaty at all when indoors which was one of my concerns. i only wish they didn't have the logo at the end of the sleeve so i could get away with wearing it under nicer tops. the logo gives it a sporty look and gives away the fact that it's a thermal.
45908	i thought i'd try to use these for running but after receiving the product and trying them on, it's clear that they are not meant for it. i could see them being good for active purposes like hiking however or working outside.
45964	not really having a problem with sweaty feet, i was surprised the the orange inserts bleed a whole bunch..if you wear dark socks you may not notice it..lighter colors will definitely be visible.  absolutely no foot support..i did not buy them for boating but have noticed that in about 3 days of walking  the little ridges for gripping the surface are gone..so these will probably be good for about only 4 months and time for another brand...uppers seem to be of ok quality at this price point
46004	the hat itself is fine. exactly what i expected for the price. however, i ordered  this hat for my 3 year old and it is waaaay too small. in fact, it barely fits my 1 year old. maybe my kids just have big heads. :)
46005	i own three pairs of these bottoms. let's compare carhartt's to some other brands:the cheap bottoms were purchased for about $10.00. they are cotton, scratchy, and of the 3 pairs purchased one split down the middle in back because they are really stitched more likely glued together.the carhartt's are smooth, 100% polyester with heavy stitching.two negatives come to mind:1) order one size larger than you are -- this goes for the cheap stuff too.2) they are not quite as good as insulation as the cheap ones.they will, however, last much, much longer.if this review was helpful, please add your vote.thanks.
46058	i hate buying underwear and detest spending any more than necessary, but took a chance on one pair due to all the positive reviews. the most comfortable briefs i have ever worn, and they are a breeze to wash out in the sink when traveling. will probable buy more in the future.
46082	had these shirts before and went back and bought some more from this same vendor. great everyday dress shirts at a great price. my first batch of these shirts lasted 2 years. good product and good vendor. i believe they are called the dress shirts group.
46090	"arrow always made an excellent poplin solid color long sleeved shirt; and this one is definitely no exception to the rule! the stitching is far above average--it's very well done. the shirt is great for both ""sporty casual"" events with a men's blazer; and it's great for everyday sharp dressing for us gents. this is one shirt that is definitely made to last years with the proper care.the stitching is particularly superior at the cuffs and neck. the fabric is 65% polyester, 35% cotton so you probably won't need to iron this after the dryer cycle. of course, you can choose to take these shirts to the cleaners instead.the front pocket on the shirt is very handy for carrying a pen, cell phone, blackberry or anything else relatively small like a public transit card for metro and subway systems.the shirts only come in white on this website; but on the brighter side they also come in sizes up to an 18.5 inch neck with a sleeve length of 36/37; and this is good for at least some of the bigger and taller guys.one reviewer correctly notes that these shirts are not button down collar shirts. the collar is not a button down type; if you want or need that style you're going to have to keep looking.overall, this is one fine dress shirt or ""sporty casual"" shirt from arrow; and it's worth every penny you'll pay for it. i highly recommend these fine shirt."
46145	perfect quality as with any arrow shirt in the collar, cuffs, buttons and shirt-tail.  my only complaint is that you absolutely must wear a white undershirt with it or certainly nipples and chest hair will show through the thin material.
46149	got this as an emergency replacement on a business trip.  the fit was was true, 17 neck 36/37 sleeve..  the quality was good for the price.  negative was there was quite a number of untrimmed threads i had to cut off from seams where the stitching fininshed.the material was a good all year round weight, not top quality, but a good value.
46163	i had always worn boxers, but hot texas summers can cause some very uncomfortable situations. i made the move to these boxer briefs and will never look back.these make my butt look good, and they make my junk look a little bigger too. the fit is fantastic. good support too, with just enough freedom.i ordered all three color options, and i highly recommend the hazy blue/dark crimson colors, or black. the grey just doesn't look as good in my opinion.
46278	i would say this is an ok shirt. the fit is good but it has two drawbacks.--needles everywhere. seriously?! just stop with the needles. that type of packaging is &#34;needlessly&#34; dangerous.--the polyester is too warm.--the length of the shirt isn't long enough.but the good thing is...--the polyester reduces wrinkles.--finally a shirt that isn't a tent around the midsection. i think most dress shirts are designed for men with big guts.
46284	van heusen men's fitted wrinkle free poplin solid shirt (stone)the stone color on this shirt is very light in color, but more resembles the color of sand. the style and design is very sharp, and contrasts well with darker suits. i wore this to a formal ceremony and receive many compliments. it is not bland like white, but does the same contrasting job with a dark or black suit.the color has the tabs sewn in so they won't come out during a wash, the sleeves fit very well, and i have no complaints other than the fact we're still using straight pins to hold the shirts even in a sustainability-centric manufacturing environment.overall: 5/5 stars, low maintenance, looks great
46296	thin material, small cuffs, jcpenny has better shirts than this.  im afraid to wash it, its already fairly wrinkled right out of the package
46450	i usually like to wear yoga pants or your typical stretch athletic capris. however, as i have gained some weight, i started not liking the way my usual attire sometimes make my hips and butt look (accentuating every bulge and imperfection).  these are a great alternative.  they are comfy and not too baggy or not too tight.  they compliment my shape well and best of all they are inexpensive.  i now own 2 pair and for the most part, very happy. my only disappointment with my black pair is that the color does fade after a few washings.
46519	i originally wrote a great review for these slippers.  my husband loved them.except, about six months later they are falling apart and not at all comfortable.  for the price, six months is way too short of a life span.  i would not buy them again.bummer!  it is so hard to find a good slipper.
46543	this is a great sturdy umbrella, the auto-open/close works great. its not too big in size but its not one of those compact one either. my only complaint is that it doesn't have that special flap so that it won't invert from a gust of wind. that hasn't happened but for the price there are others that include this feature.
46555	isotoners are the best gloves around.  they are always a good fit, always comfortable and look really stylish.  i have them in every color i can get.
46562	fit is okay, feels to startchy and stiff for me. i tried it on and it still hangs in my closet, i will never wear it!
46662	these boots look adorable; i got the blue ones. they look just like the picture. they are extremely comfortable, too! i wear size 10-1/2; i got a size 11 for big socks and they fit great.
46699	i like the style of these shoes. it gives a professional look while still being casual. i wear it to work all the time now.the shoes fit my feet very well, its spacious and not tight at all. shoes seem to be holding up well the last few weeks, there aren't any major threads loose, tearing or discoloration.package came in within a week, no complaints about that either.
46713	i have wore rockport shoes before so i know what a great shoe they are, nice and i can polish them to make them look better. many of my friends have asked what  kind they are and said they would buy a pair.
46731	i absolutely love these shoes, they're even cuter in person! they really resemble a pair of doc marten's i had in the early 90's. super comfy!revision: after wearing these shoes only a handful of times one of the shoes started squeaking really loudly! i have no idea what caused it since they are in near perfect condition. i have never had a shoe squeak so loudly...it's made them impossible to wear. i actually really loved these shoes, and was sad i basically wasted my money since i couldn't wear them anymore. i spoke with amazon customer service and they are replacing my defective shoes! i'm so thankful for such awesome customer service!
46768	i really wanted these boots after seeing a random girl on the streets wearing them, and then seeing my coworker a few days later with the same boots! they both bought the cognac color, which is the color i bought, and the boots are very comfortable, true to size, and super cute and stylish! the only reason i gave these boots four stars instead of five is because of the quality of the leather. the leather is rather thin and stiff/crumbly like brown packaging paper, not smooth and buttery. but what did you expect for the price? i would not pay more than $120 for these. in fact, i'd say these boots are really worth about $80 max. i only bought these and ignored the quality because the style is too adorable. i haven't seen the boots in black but my advice when buying boots with average-poor quality leather is to not buy black. it's much easier (in my opinion) to tell good quality leather from bad quality when it's black leather. brown is a more casual look and more forgiving to scratches and inconsistencies. oh yeah, i bought these in size 7 and they fit true to size.
46813	i stumbled across the smith serpico sunglasses about 5 years ago.  i'm on my third pair now -- because i lose them -- and always, always return to these.  i love them for a few reasons:1) there is absolutely no distortion in these lenses.  as cliche as it may sound, i sometimes forget that i'm wearing them.  they cover your complete field-of -vision and offer extreme optical clarity.2) the polarized lenses are top-notch.  i've never once noticed the polarizing pattern in the lenses, even in bright reflections.  you know it's great when you don't notice it.3) smith offers a lifetime warranty on these.  you do need to provide a receipt (made easy through amazon), but they have a quick turnaround with no hassle.  i managed to bend up the first pair i had badly, but smith replaced them -- no questions asked -- quickly and painlessly.4) they're extremely comfortable and the bayonet-style temples never poke your ears or head.  i wear mine from sun-up to sundown without any discomfort.  they fit snugly enough that they won't go flying off your face and stay in position well, even when turning your head abruptly or leaning over.  but they're not overly-tight; offering absolutely no discomfort even after 10 hours of wear.these are some of the best sunglasses available in my opinion.  coupled with a price that's below many of the competitive equivalents and a lifetime warranty, they (continue to) come across as a bargain.  if/when i lose this third pair, rest assured the fourth will be on their way.
46832	this shoe is a well made shoe. it fits nicely and is very comfortable. i would and will purchase it again. i do have other styles of shoes in the clarks brand and they to fit great..
46834	my husband so far really likes these shoes.  he has a wide foot, but i did not order the extra wide.  he has wore sas for years and wanted something little different, but still good quality.  he is on his feet all day working at a school campus in the maintenance department.  at first i found these on foot smart and they were $50 more expensive.  amazon always has the best price.
46923	"first, let me say that it is a rather dangerous notion that anyone would take a non-gps wristwatch seriously enough to depend on it for any legitimate use. these watches are not much more than techno bling.pros:it's a techno-gadget and gadgets are fun. looks decent, tells the time and date well. solar and atomic time are excellent features and work well for me in the northern us.cons:the compass is inaccurate. i calibrated it by the manual. but often it thinks south is north. you could end up dead with that kind of inaccuracy.update: after performing a northerly calibration about 10 or 20 times, it now seems to know which way is north. i still have no idea why the thing kept reading 180 degrees off previously. regardless, i'd only use this compass to find a general heading. in no way would i ever use this compass with a map in a legitimate situation.the altimeter is inaccurate. i set the base value to zero in my driveway, drive around all day, and when i return home it measures anywhere from -40' on one day to 200' another day. in fact, i can calibrate it to zero in my living room, come back 10 minutes later, and it will not be at zero. that being the case, how can anyone expect to climb a mountain and return with any kind of accurate data about their trek? elevation alone isn't much use for hiking if you don't also know the distance you've traveled. an altimeter would seem more useful to an airplane pilot who only needs an altitude figure. however, the instructions advise against using the watch for such a purpose. so an altimeter on a watch doesn't seem very useful. you really need gps for elevation over distance traveled. i'd prefer the graph to be shown in the largest portion of the screen so i can see the terrain as i cover it, with the number at the top of the screen and the time of day at the bottom. the way this watch records and stores altimeter data boggles the mind- scrolling through records and pages of data and trying to delete this information has been a lesson in futility for me.the barometer is decent. it seems accurate to within 5 something-or-others. when it says 29.95 i get the same reading from my smart phone's weather report. but again, i'd much prefer to see the bar graph in the large portion of the screen, with the actual number at the top and the time of day at the bottom.it's been showing a steady trend downward for over 36 hours today, but no bad weather in sight by any local weather reports. has no alert for approaching bad weather. one must consider the value of this compared to a weather rock outside one's window sill, where if the rock is wet, you can be sure it's raining.thermometer: let's face it, we're are sporting a device whose sole purpose is to be worn on the body. why should we have to remove it each time we want to see the ambient temperature? they can't fix this at this point in technological history?the backlight, still, ridiculously shuts off after only 1 second, pissing me off every time. it makes sense to have this be user-adjustable on this watch, since: there's a lot more to look at than the current time, and this watch is rechargeable, so power usage isn't a real concern.illogical button navigation: let me tell you a very logical secret: up should increment and down should decrement. but this watch is backward, like so many casios. by what logic should the top button decrement and the bottom button increment? answer: only if you were to take the watch off your wrist and hold it in front of you with the band set horizontally left to right. but on the wrist all watches are viewed as though 12:00 were north. so the up/down buttons are annoying.one more: why can't the date read like most other casios? why can't i have: ""mon. 02.27""? nobody needs to read the current year. i need a glance at which day of the week today is, which month we're in (for when the month rolls over every 30-ish days), and the number of day today is within the month. but this most useful feature is missing!this watch looks ok, though rather plain.let's put this watch, and others of its non-gps kind in context: the mfrp is 300 us dollars. you can get one heck of an awesome and accurate hiking gps unit for that much with cash left over for accessories. i only bought mine because it was 50% off on sale. moreover, gps watches are beginning to appear in the 200-500 range, and the features of those things blow these abc watches in the dust for not all that much more.abc watches are outdated, horribly inaccurate and lack some of the most basic logic on a techno watch, such as backlight timeout and button logic.i'd buy these abc watches for under 150 bucks, just for the gadgetry of it. but for real outdoor tracking, it's a far wiser investment to go with a real gps device. even better to bring a manual compass and map."
46949	"i sure do.i've worn these shirts for years.now, granted...like many other brands these had their problems in the beginning.the first shirt i bought from this brand was a really cool dark brown with blue highlights.this was maybe ten years ago before brown and blue became such ""in"" colors.it was a beauty but after only a few weeks the edge of the collar and the edge of the cuffs wore off and faded into a totally different color.that shirt went in the garbage.i then stuck with calvin klein dress shirts till one day i noticed a beene dress shirt in a stunning emerald green.i had to have it.is it just me or is a pretty green almost impossible to find in mens dress shirts?most of them either lean to the brown or yellow end of the green spectrum.not this shirt. everyone loved this shirt and this is the one shirt that really started my love affair with geoffrey beene.it wore well, withstood multiple washings.and years later, beene is the only dress shirt i still wear.how much more simple can it be to look good?wash it, dry it, done.now.....if they would just bring back that emerald green and brown/blue hue shirt i would be in beene heaven.the fit of the shirt is perfect unless you buy one of the ""fitted"" versions which i am too heavy to wear lol.geoffrey beene shirts come....highly recommended!!!"
46962	"what does a thirtysomething geek like myself do when he's a bit too stressed out over work or traffic?  he goes to his doctor!  the ""doctor who in your pocket"" keychain is the perfect tension tamer in any situation.  oh how i'd love to ""exterminate"" or ""delete"" a few of the idiots i've encountered on the highway sometimes.  this keychain gives me the opportunity and a little bit of satisfaction as well.  it features two sayings from those nasty daleks, two from the emotionless cybermen, a positive note from k-9, and the wonderful sound of the tardis as it whisks the doctor and his companions off into time and space.  if for no other reason than to have a little fun, i recommend picking up the ""doctor who in your pocket"" keychain.  i'll probably never put actual keys on it (it's a bit large), but i'll be blasting it at my enemies on the highway until i regenerate."
46997	these are a very well made shoe. i just wished they made them in 1/2 sizes. i originally purchased a size 12 and they were too big. i sent them back and purchased a size 11 they do fit, the only problem is they could stand to be a 1/2 size bigger. the size 12 slipped up and down when i walked in them and the size 11 rubs on the large toes when i walk in them. i am hoping that with use, the size 11s will become a little more roomier in the toe area..
47066	the older clark shoes had an excellent foot bed and arch support system. these don't have that, but after adding dr scholl's arch supports i am happy with them.
47081	i love this polo, fits great & such good quality. i weigh 120 lbs and i fit a small well & a medium is a little lose but still fits. for the price you can't get any better!!!!
47169	after being diagnosed with morton's neuromas, i found that shoe fit became very important to me.  i have been purchasing grasshopper shoes for the past couple of years and find them to be a good fit, fairly comfortable, nice arch support, and the right price.  if i could afford to buy better quality shoes, i would, but, since i can't, i find the grasshoppers (all styles) the next best thing.
47257	easy to sew into a garment and are molded for modesty, but the sharp points hurt - i cut them off and stitched pad to garment where i snipped. a good product for the price.
47307	nice shoes, comfortable fit, but the squeak and cracking noise they made when i walked was the reason i returned them.
47342	hubby says they fit but aren't comfy. we ordered with a quicksilver pair which he favors. we are keeping only because he took the tags off already.
47370	so simple and so small.  this is a first rate basic men's card holder.  the internal and external pockets make it so versatile.fits so well into a front or back pocket.
47414	i bought this for my husband. and we both like it. very good quality and nice looking. the leather feels good. and the organization is very nice. the size is actually 16*12*4.75 and it fits 15.4 laptop. highly recommend.
47444	"i own several tags, breitlings, omega, citizen, torgoen, and tissot.  this is my first luminox, and i bought it mainly for the novelty of the tritium illumination vials - everyone should have at least one h3 watch in their collection.all markings are *very* high contrast white.  the tritium 5-minute marker vials are blue, the second hand marker vial is blue, with green vials on the hour/minute hands, a green vial on the 12 hour marker and a small green bezel marker. the tritium illumination isn't as bright as perhaps some marketing material and pictures would make it out to be - however it is very good and certainly does the job in low light or darkness.the watch is large which is my preference, about the same size as a tag formula one grande.  the bezel turns in one direction, a safety feature for divers so they cannot accidentally bump the bezel and 'add time' to their tank supply after aligning the zero to the minute hand just before diving - a one way bezel can only subtract time if you bump it. the bezel has a nice, solid ratchet feel when rotating. the numbers on the bezel are in fact countersunk/engraved, not just painted on the top surface of the bezel - so it would seem to be difficult to 'wipe or rub off' the paint as some have suggested.the watch case, case back, and bezel are made from a polycarbonate & carbon composite material.  this makes the watch light, but some may think it feels cheap.  however these materials are very strong, and give the watch a low magnetic signature - important if you are working near explosives/mines (eod) or navigating with a handheld compass.  it probably makes the trip through airport metal detectors a little easier too :-)  the case back has a large engraved special warfare insignia (aka navy seal trident, aka ""the budweiser"").  the case back is secured to the case by 4 screws.the crown seems to be plastic or perhaps composite, and it does not screw down. if the crown was a screw down, eventually users would strip the plastic screw threads.  so this crown pushes in and pulls out.  this could be a concern for preventing moisture entering the watch, however luminox rates the watch good to a 200m depth.  be sure your crown is pushed in well before you take to water or even wash your hands.the band is a typical polyurethane strap that seems well made and offers plenty of adjustment for wrists large or small. be careful though - i have seen these types of straps be destroyed by some bug sprays/bug lotions.  the north strap has a luminox logo molded in. the buckle is stainless steel, has a stamped luminox logo, and has double tangs of stainless steel.once concern is that the strap is 23mm.  this will make finding replacement straps difficult, as 23mm is not a popular size for watch straps.  the amazon id for the replacement strap is b001bqnwbq or b001mv2j7s.the mineral crystal is very clear, but it sure would be nice (and more expensive) if the watch had the harder sapphire crystal.this is a nice knockaround watch, made better if you catch it on sale. i paid $157 direct from amazon."
47487	i love this little nose bone. the flair at the tip is perfect sized to keep the jewelry in place without ripping any skin when you take it out. the crystal is beautiful and continues to sparkle. any time it starts to get dull, i simply clean it with some witch hazel on a q-tip and it's sparkling like new in no time. i did see a lot of reviews on here saying the stud is too long, but it fits me perfect. i haven't had any issues with it poking me and i feel like if it were shorter i would run the risk of loosing it (but maybe i have a large nostril?). i have a double nostril piercing, so i bought 3, 2 to wear and one for backup. would buy again if anything happens to the ones i have.
47544	"this is my first pair of dr. martens, and i absolutely love them. people compliment on it whenever i wear them with black outfit, in order to let this pair of awesome shoes stand out (and they do!)the only problem i have with doc martens is their sizing. i wear a 5.5 in uk sizing, and i had to choose a 6 (which is huge; i could fit my thumb or more in the gap) or a 5 which would squish my toes. eventually, i went for a size 6, and bought the comfort insole wearing either thick socks or two layers of cotton. it helped a lot and now the size 6 fits.when you wear the boots, you'd at least need to wear thick hiking socks to break into them, else face the consequences of multiple blisters (wearing regular socks, i had a huge blister on my right heel which popped, and i couldn't wear anything but flip-flops for a week.)in doubt with .5's , go up a size. although (yes, they're leather) they'll loosen up someday, you won't be able to wear them for good periods of time. boots are supposed to be ""larger"", anyway. make sure they fit after getting the insoles and socks though; if they still don't work, that means the boots are too big for you and that you should go down a size."
47566	these are comfortable and simple. great for the beach but don't look out of place when worn with something a little dressier. i bought these years ago and wore them almost daily. my dog ate one of them, so i'm coming to buy another pair. the best black flip flop i've found at this price.
47570	they use to be made great...not anymore.  already had to toss 2 pairs after a few washings.  threads came out and tearing at stitched lines.
47578	earrings are lovely.  clasp is sturdy.  good price and good service.  size is just about right and i would like a similar smaller pair.
47638	i ride western and spend some time almost every day either on my horse or in a paddock.  these justin boots are very comfortable and serviceable and were reasonably priced.  they seem to be waterproof (no intrusive leakage from mud) and i was gratified to find that though they were reversibly dented, they protected my toes the several times my horse managed to step on them!
47702	these are nice, light and comfortable, can't say anything bad about them really other than they seem a little overpriced for what you get.  the sizing runs a little large, so factor that into what you order.
47757	buy a half size smaller than your actual shoe size, they will stretch. machine washable. if worn every day, with active lifestyle, they will last 3-5 months. if rotated with other shoes last much longer. i would recommend footie socks inside, as they do not breathe that much and the leather can absorb sweat/odor.
47797	they always say to order half a size down since they stretch out. i ordered the size i order for any other shoe (size 8), and i really like the fit. they are very comfortable to wear and i enjoy having shoes i can easily slip on and off! the only thing that sucks is that since their place and that canvas material, they get dirty pretty easily.
47799	just as expected. fit just other 5.5 toms my daughter has. we'll get more as more cute styles become available.
47931	i'll start right off with what i didn't like and kept these from 5 stars so i can go into detail with why i still recommend them above any other boot i've worn. they are on the chunkier side in terms of sheer mass compared to some other steel-toes i've worn. the good thing about a less bulky boot is that you have greater ease moving in them and they feel more natural. there's also an aesthetic argument about the cartoonishness of big boots, however hopefully you're not thinking of steel-toes for the aesthetics. also, having holes instead of hooks for the top 2 loops is a minor pain. you just have to lace-up every time you put them on.these boots are exceptionally comfy. they run a bit narrow, but they have excellent support and are tight without cutting off circulation or giving you bruises. i'd chalk this up to the extensive padding. i wore these boots all day the first time i had them and felt better than most good days in my old boots.the soles for these boots are thick. they'll give you 2 inches. if you're on the shorter side like me, it's a bit of a blessing. they're also secured against electrical surges so you don't get fried if a live wire drops on a treadplate you happen to be standing on. the grip is nothing short of excellent. i haven't had the chance to try it on snow or ice yet, but it holds on dead leaves and slick pavement. it makes the clunkyness bearable.they are also waterproof up to your ankle due to tight stitching/seams, and a sewn-in tongue. doesn't seem helpful until that puddle was a little deeper than you thought. whoops. these boots will ensure your socks are still warm and dry. when it's 37 out, that's kind of a big effin' deal as our vp once put it.the steel on the toe is thick and the weight gives you some comfort when you hold the boot in your hand. it will save your little piggies should you suffer the misfortune of having something heavy land on your foot. that's kind of the idea.on another note, on at least one instance in my life i was glad of having a pair of steel-toes as i sat at a bar with a friend in a rough area. the bouncers had metal detectors. we went back to the car and i dropped off my sog trident that i typically carry and my buddy dropped off his smith and wesson. point is, in a pinch, a steel-toes are like brass-knuckles for your feet that can't get taken off you due to a metal-detector. stay safe out there.great pair of boots, can't go wrong with them. i got them for $100 and was pleased as pie with the arrangement.
48015	got this for my father in-law who is a huge harry potter fan.  the item description isn't really clear if this will fit an adult, but it is an adult size hat.  well made too.  he loved it.
48047	these i got for my husband, he has wide feet and hates to shop, so i buy most of these things for him. i asked him &#34;why aren't you wearing your new shoes&#34;, that's when he showed me his bruised ankle. the shoes hit directly at the ankle. he's chaffed like he had a diaper rash. unfortunately, because he is not one to stir up stuff, he keep it secret. when he asked for new shoes with more coverage. that's when i figured out, he just wasn't wearing them. it should be above the ankle, these are not.
48054	i have several different types of darn tough merino wool socks and these are just as good as the others.  the sizing is spot on, the fit around the calf is tight (which i like as it gives more support) and they offer a fair amount of cushioning in the sole.  if you're looking for some warm, comfortable and zero-itch wool socks, check these out.
48056	i only had these socks for about a week or so, but i had to write a review on how they changed my sketchers boots into something as comfortable as my asics.product review:best pair of work socks i ever wore, hands down.pros- good qualitylifetime warrantygood in any weather (i live in florida and my feet still stay cool in boots)cons- pricey for a pair of socks (15 dollars, whew)weird colors, not anything i can use for a interviewthey are socks, i am probably going to lose them to the gnomes before i can even bother to send them back to get new pair
48074	these legwarmers are not like the photo. they are scratchy, holey, and made of cheap material. i would recommend buying them from a actual dance store or from an online dance shop. you will get better quality by the same name somewhere else.
48085	"i'm 5'10"" and wear a 36 bra and have a wide set of shoulders.  so i got the nude color in this and ordered up a size so it would be a little loose and hopefully be a little longer.  the 38 fits me just right - no room to spare - but the length on me is half way between hip and knee.  that's a little short for me, but it'll do.  the lacy material goes across my shoulder blades and itches me like crazy.  it's fine, but take these facts into consideration. also, the color i chose did provide the modesty i wanted."
48096	shoes are made of a really pretty silk-like fabric.  they have great padded insoles that are very comfortable.  the shoes will be a great addition to my summer wardrobe, both pants and skirts.
48106	i've owned this watch for almost 2 years and it is my fallback watch when i can't decide what else to wear.  i own 6 mk watches and this one is definitely my staple.
48151	other sports bras i have tried since being an h cup have been an absolute joke, and it was extremely frustrating finding something that would support me so i could zumba without the pain of the ladies bouncing all over the place.i did a random search online, and found this bra (i ordered the level 4 support).  i was surprised at the negative reviews on amazon, since they were so positive elsewhere.  it is a bit difficult to put on--but it's a sports bra, it is supposed to be very snug to hold you in.  and you are working out---i don't expect my boobs to look attractive in a sports bra that is holding them in so i can run and jump and dance.  if you think this sports bra is going to make your boobs look amazing, you need to lower your expectations and buy a supportive bra, not a cute one!this is definitely worth the price.  the only negative is the fabric on the sides is a little scratchy--but that shouldn't bother you with a t shirt on.
48168	"i should know not to believe product descriptions.  i made a mistake and bought a bunch of these laces in both round and flat.  all of them are utter garbage, not even decent polyester. i bought laces in orange, green (light and dark), light blue, red, yellow, and 'rainbow'.  got them in two sizes, for orange and 'rainbow'.the 36"" 'rainbow' laces aren't laces, but ribbons.  they also come in a 63"" version.  these ribbons are actually half-way decent;  basically two ribbons per lace, bonded together.  they are the right width (standard for padded collar sneakers).  since you can't find these in stores -- or at least, i can't -- these might be worth buying.  they are colorfast in warm water and can be dried on medium cotton heat.the other flat 63"" laces in solid colors are way too wide (easily 1/2 inch), cheap easily broken polyester, total waste.  the round laces are so flimsy, you know they will unravel soon after wearing.  the other flat 36"" laces are standard athletic-shoe width, but again are cheap like the rest.even laces you buy in the dollar stores or walmart, are better than these.  waste of money.  shipping for the nine pairs of laces was only 4 oz, so it would cost only another fifty cents to return;  but then i'm out $6 in postage total, on a $12 purchase of the laces themselves.  so won't return them, but also won't buy any more.you really do get what you pay for, and what one should pay for, is cotton laces.  next time, that's what i'll do: in a brick-and-mortar store where i can prove they are cotton, first."
48202	this is a great jacket for the money and it fit perfectly. it is not the same cut as the original a-2 flight jackets, but close enough for everyday wear. quality leather and heavy duty zippers are a plus.
48207	i already had this jacket once and was very pleased of it. there was no question which one to re-order. very good, soft and trendy. i love it.luxary lane offers excellent products.
48294	i have small feet, very high arches, these are heaven on my feet!  i have them in 4 colors, and while i wish they were a bit more feminine, i wouldn't trade them in for anything else, as they are very comfortable, i can wear them all day, day after day and forget that i even have them on.  i can run in them if i'm in a hurry and they stay on great and feel great in a jog (let's say running from  car to a store in a downpour.)
48313	my husband (tall, skinny) usually looks awesome in the 511s, but these are of a stiffer material that looks kinda cheap.  additionally, the pockets are really big, going well past the bottom of his cute bum.  i wouldn't buy these again.
48446	i purchased these for $90 on a gold box deal; very nice for the money.  however, i did have to exchange them, as one of the pearls on the earrings was not centered or completely attached when glued.  amazon was speedy and good about the exchange.  there are very minor flaws in the pearls in the necklace (none noticed in the earrings), but when wearing, aren't noticeable.  nice clasp on necklace, also, strung well.  i might not have been quite as happy, if the price were much higher.  i would purchase these again!
48447	i got them at a steal on gold box or lightning.  they are not the high quality but they are beautiful for the price.  would recommend; but know what you are buying.
48459	i love the buxton snap card case for women i purchased online at amazon.com. it is very handy & easy to carry. i was looking for a credit card case with a zipper which is what i really want but i could not find exactly the one i wanted to invest in so i ordered this one & i really do like it. it is so compact and doesn't take up a lot of space at all in my purse. the only drawback i have is that my credit cards can be seen because there is no closure it simply snaps but it serves the purpose.
48489	this quality wallet is the perfect size, especially for today's crossbody purses! great product and price! nice color! thank you!
48494	this is smaller than appearance.  i wouldn't recommend unless it is for a child.  hard too zip shut if you have a credit card in each slot and carry more than 5 bills.
48530	this is a jewel. holds all my card credit or otherwise....has a place for change  and bills. love the colors. great quality.
48546	"i love ""beyond"" i own several sport bras and just got the yoga pants i ordered 3 weeks ago ..i ordered white color size xs i am 5'3"" 127 lbs i am muscular so i am not as big as most 127 women do  - why 4 stars ? because the fabric is pretty thin ... i am not gonna dry this pants for sure. but they look good on me..."
48567	i have bought many of these. they are supportive, the pads that come with it are removable. my favorite nursing bra so far. it can sometimes feel like it squishes your breasts too much. also works well with nursing tanks.
48722	she has gotten many compliments. it was very inexpensive and people ask where she got it. a nice gift for the price. shipping was super quick and cheap too
48789	these were both comfortable, and practical.  i wore three pair over 3 weeks, and washed them out each night and by morning they were dry and fresh.  they are full cut, and very flexible, and comfortable on long walks and hikes.  they really did work perfect for traveling, and enabled me to pack a bit lighter.
48807	i purchased a few pairs of these for a trip to peru's amazon region.  since we couldn't take a lot of clothes with us (it was a three week trip and we had to carry our luggage and my photographic gear on small planes, river boats, buses, trains, trails, etc.) i decided to look for some briefs that would keep me cool and be easy to wash.  these really fit the bill.  we spent several nights in a jungle cabin with over 90% humidity and they still dried out overnight (although it took about 6 hours under those conditions.) i have a size 38 waist and the xl fit nicely.  yes, they do cost a bit, but they are worth it.  i will be buying more.
48824	it's really nice and fits well. i'm 5'5 and 115 lbs and purchased the medium size. the sleeves are a little longer than i expected but i'm having no problems with it since i fold the sleeves all the way up to my elbows and it looks cuter that way. the small would of looked better on me though, and more snug. still, this is a 5 star product.
48827	i have 38 d chest so i knew i was taking a risk on ordering this jacket in a large, i'm 5'4 166lbs and a size 8 but have lots of extra pudge from having 3 kids, when i ordered this i knew i would have to wear this open vs closed.it's a great jacket for the price, just gotta work on my waist and it should fit fine.if you have a nice waist than this should fit you even with a bigger chest but if not look for another in xl.
48834	i usually don't buy clothes online, but i took a chance on this blazer and i'm very glad i did! i've been searching for the perfect blazer to wear with jeans and this is it. i got a medium size which fits well but it's a touch loose, however the small would have been too small. i have a 36b bust, i'm 5'6&#34; and 120 pounds just in case anyone isn't sure what size to get. the sleeves on the jacket are long, which is what i really like because a lot of these types of jackets have slightly short sleeves. the material is a bit thinner than i expected, but i prefer it that way. for the price, it's a well constructed jacket which appears to be made with good quality fabric. i'm very satisfied with my purchase!
48870	these bra back extenders are well made and form an exact fit to a 2 inch bra strap. the fabric is sturdy and firm; they don't have an elastic panel as some others do so the fit is very reliable, consistent and not too stretchy. the hooks stay secured once fastened.pleased with this purchase and recommended.
48926	i only had to wear this once or twice on a two week trip to the amazon.  it was either this or a $100 rainproof light jacket from rei.  overall this  one did fine.  it's very packable and not too bad on the over-heating aspects.  would purchase again.
48941	this is  a great idea for an umbrella, but...it's not a very wide brim. also when you close the umbrella when its wet, the plastic sticks together and it's hell to open up. there also signs of rust already.
48977	how else to get an authentic hawaiian shirt.  buy from a hawaiian based shirt shop.  i have received compliments about this shirt.  i will buy more from this company.
49085	run a little small.  had to use the first fasten which i never do.  otherwise i like to look and the feel.
49105	i had read the reviews of this bra. they said that it runs small and to order the larger size. i did, and it was too large and needed to return it for the right size. there was never a question. the new bra arrived within the week after returning it. interestingly enough, it was the same bra that i bought at jcpenney's just the week before, at the same price.
49143	i liked this suit a lot. it fit well and was comfortable (5'4&#34;, 150 lb, size 38). it wasn't very tight like a competition suit but it was perfect for work outs. i used it 2-3 times per week in a chlorinated pool and it lasted for six months. not bad for the price!
49189	this is a great thing to have on hand but it doesnt work for all materials in my opinion.  this was worth buying but it didnt work on all my clothes.
49193	"ok, maybe ""life saver"" is a little dramatic, but this product is definitely a must in my book. already i've used it to keep bra straps in place, hold up a top to avoid bra exposure, tuck in a loose string, help keep space between buttons closed, and close up a space between a ripped seam. it's ridiculous how many wardrobe malfunctions i've corrected in the short time i've owned this, and how many embarrassing moments i've prevented. i keep one little box at the office and have one at home- and i almost think having a third would be great to carry along in my purse.i think the strips are a little long for some fixes, but i just cut them in half. they are sticky and will hold once you first put them on and will hold throughout the day, as long as you don't need to readjust- once you unstick them, they lose their grip, so be careful when you first place them. but overall fantastic!"
49270	i ordered the size recommended per the size chart -- unsure why a previous reviewer said to get a larger one. i probably could have gone a size smaller, but i'm a 32 waist, so a medium is sometimes too large. regardless, good product from a well-known and respectable company. i am happy with my purchase.(really. don't get a larger size or the entire purpose of having a jock strap is lost.)
49275	speedo is a well known reputable, dependable, well taylored swim wear, which is reasonably priced and good looking, available in wide variety of colors, and styles.
49284	not sure why this is advertised as a 'fashion' suit versus a normal/racer breif, but, in either case it's minimal and fits well.
49298	this fits as expected and works well as a shorts-type swimsuit. too many swimshorts are the longer style, but these are just as pictured and are more of the traditional short (but not too short) style. the small size fits me well with 31&#34; waist and plenty of extra room.the main drawback is that these have no outside pocket at all, not in front or back. they just have a tiny inside mesh pocket, which is so small it barely holds a credit card or card-type hotel room key. if you need to carry anything or wear them around town, look instead for a pair with pockets. although for swimming, the lack of pockets is a good thing and makes them less baggy and will dry faster.i'd buy them again if i wanted a pair for beach or swimming and didn't need pockets.
49303	unlike what you expect when you see this brand, this is not a competitive swim suit, but rather a very comfortable garment that wears like shorts, is roomy where it needs to be, and flatters an older mature body in a roomy way.  great product.
49306	my husband lives in these shorts.  just the right length for him and extremely comfortable.  he is in a wheelchair now but has worn them both ways, i'm not allowed to buy anything else!
49395	i bought this pair of swim trunks for a caribbean cruise and am glad i did!  they are very comfortable, soft without being too thin, and were a bit cheaper than some of the other equivalent brand names.  the pockets were very helpful as well.
49410	the trend for most suits now having the length below the knee and really baggy.  if you're like me and don't like that trend, this is the suit for you.  loose enough for comfort, you don't have a damp clammy suit covering you legs after you swim.  speedo, so well made and designed.  waterproof bag in pocket is a plus.
49544	i returned this bad with sadness. i liked that it was more structured than most baggallini bags. it was very flat and would not hold anything with any heft. the pockets were small and i was not sure how to use them  i wish baggallini would find a way to combine the best features of this and luggage everywhere bag.  they'd have a hit.
49551	even though this purse seems to be able to expand and does do so, it makes the bag look awkward.  it looks like an accordion from the profile.  also, the magnetic front flap won't close due to the design of the strap, it pulls the front flap upwards when worn.  the strap design also makes it difficult to access the main compartment.  it's disappointing because it is a really good looking bag.
49565	i purchased my uptown bag for hands free use when i go shopping or to parks with kids.  it is very nicely made, and looks very good.  it is on the big side, but still very functional.  i love the many compartments it has.  i highly recommend it.
49599	did not fit the torso at all.  if i can say so, it went from my butt to shoulders in a tight straight line with absolutely no contour on the upper body.  the legs fit well. . .  i can probably use it with a waist clincher, and the lace is very pretty.  overall huge disappointment.  will not buy again.  :(
49600	i am 5'4 and 160 lbs.  36b 30 39.  it was very roomy.  disappointed in the fit.  there was extra room in every area.  however, it held up well washing it in the delicate cycle.
49650	my daughter loved this. although more stickers went other places besides the box. her and her sister enjoyed playing with it..
49699	i wore these in my commercial kitchen. nice for wet floors as this shoe doesn't slip. but the front of the sole is coming off after a short time of wearing them. i think they are made badly. i've never had any other croc do this.
49784	i just received these shoes and i have to say i am very disappointed with them.  i am a server and i didn't have non skid shoes.  i slipped and fell on my butt!  i was wearing saucony walking shoes at the time which have the wide toe box and the cusion plus the wide sole on the shoe.  my feet never hurt me.  i bought a pair of avia's and they pinched my little toe in addition to being super narrow!  my friend at work said to try skechers as they were very cushy and comfy.  i ordered a 10e, normally i wear a 10b,. as in looking at the pictures they seemed narrow.  i just took them out of the box and put them on.  they are tight, hard and there is no flex to the sole.  i barely had any lace to tie trying to loosen them up.  i would even fathom wearing them to work.  back in the box they go and back to amazon.  i am a little disappointed and just ordered new balance non slip which are a little more expensive but hoping they will be just what i am looking for!.
49821	making a long, dissappointing story, short!  christmas present.  citizen should be made well.  he takes it out and then tried it on, only to find he couldn't even get it around his wrist!!!  i was so upset!  do not order this unless you are anorexic!
49847	my husband is picky about his undershirts when it comes to quality material, shrinkage in the wash, stretching when wearing, etc. we purchased 5 brands of tanks to compare: bvd, dockers, tommy hilfiger, hanes, and evolve (from target). these tied for last with hanes, the evolve leaving them all in the dust.
49858	i was looking high and low for a cigaret case to use as a wallet and thanks to another review i bought this one.  i love it! the first week i had it i was putting it in my back pocket and must have sat on the edge of something. it got all bent up and wouldn't shut so i was really upset.  i bent it back and now put it in my front pocket and it still works great.  i get tons of compliments on it when i pull it out. (none of my friends expect me to be that cool.)  it fits my debit card id and money in it and it works perfect.  i think i will probably buy another one just incase i do break this one.  my only gripe is that the little elastic thing comes off a lot, but i just put it back on.  i think i will try wiring it on there with some jewelers wire.
49861	"i ordered this and the matching earrings at the same time without ever having seen them in ""real life."" i was hoping that they would be pretty. i was not disappointed. as soon as i opened the box, i said, ""ooooooh!""the pendant shines mostly purple and blue colors and it really picks up the light and has long facets along all the edges. the crystal is 3/4 inch square. in case you were wondering, the crystals on the earrings are 9/16 of an inch square. so this is bigger and the frame is wider (about 3/16"" versus 2/16"" for the earrings.)as you can see from the photo, the bale is round. it is a 1/2 inch round ring, but it doesn't leave a lot of room at the top for a big chain (as the ring must sit in the corner of the crystal.) i have mine on a thin chain because i thought it set off the pendant better anyway (you have to supply your own chain.)just like the earrings, the back of the crystal is plain silver, sort of like a mirror. i don't know what this material is on the back (sterling foil? silver leaf? paint?) but it must serve to reflect the light back through the crystal facets. i am storing mine in the box it came in to prevent any scratching of this backing (even though i am not sure it will indeed scratch, i don't want to take a chance.)overall, the pendant and earrings are very different and sparkly. i receive many compliments and questions (""where did you get those?!?) every time i wear them."
49862	i bought the square vitrial light crystal pendant and earrings to make a set like many other reviewers and i have to agree that they make a fantastic set.  my order was processed quickly, delivery was rapiid and the pendant and earrings look great.  i'm very pleased wiht this purchase and would shop with gem avenue again!
49938	i bought as a cover up for the pool.  perfect length, hits right above/ at the knee if you are 5'6&#34;.  a little on the large size, i'm a 16 and fits very well.
49940	"i had hoped this wrap would be thicker and have more velco closures.  the top is fine although it could have more velcro to make it tighter, but the only other velcro is tiny and right in a location where you can still ""show off"" body parts that you would want hidden.  i wont return it, but i might try to modify it myself.  bottom line....not really worth the money."
49947	this wrap is good quality, comfortable, and will easily fit a size 16 woman while covering her completely. the fabric is thinner and more lightweight than a robe, which i appreciate, because it doesn't make me hot like a robe can after a steaming shower. the black color keeps anything from showing through the fabric, anyway. this may actually be the best wrap i've ever owned.
50014	"this robe drapes beautifully.  i'm 5'4"" tall, muscular build (a runner)and about 125 pounds.  the small/medium was perfect.  anyone small thanmyself will find it on the large side.  anyone larger than myself shouldget the medium/large.  i did buy both.  the medium large hung on my likea shapeless curtain.  forget that!  the small/medium fits me perfectly.i have long arms and the sm/med fits them perfectly where the med/largecovered my hands!  the black is okay, but i wish this was made in othercolors. it's not for winter - it's a t-shirt weight but with a butter softfeel.  i don't know how it will wash yet, so i'm keeping the med/large justin case this one comes out barbie-doll size... after wash/drying.  i'mtoo impatient to hang anything to dry!  finally i don't have a frumpybathrobe!  where are more colors???!!!!  feels great.  i hope i've givenenough size information here...to be helpful.  anyone under 100 poundsisn't going to find the sm/med small enough.  anhyone over 130/140 poundsbetter move to the med/large.  hope this helps.  it's a definite buy ---because it doesn't make you look like your grandmother!  ha ha. - love yougrandma - just kidding of course!"
50023	i recommend the large tall t-shirts for men over 6 foot. the standard sized t-shirts are not long enough to stay tucked in.good value purchase and buying online takes the burden out of purchasing t-shirts
50055	"**update:**  i've been wearing this pair of danskos for 5 years and they're still holding strong.  the insole does feel a bit hard to me these days, so it needs a thin cushy insole.  otherwise, they look great, i run a polishing cloth thingy over them every couple months to add a bit of gloss to them.  these danskos were more expensive than other shoes, but they're worth it, they're great quality and built to last.  they won't fall apart on you.**original review:**i love these danskos!  i have this clog in black, size 39 (i normally wear a size 9).  i went to a store to try these on so i got the correct size, and i wear a thinner sock.  i needed a shoe for a new job that wasn't a business dress shoe, yet wasn't a tennis shoe.  these fit the bill, and i fell in love with them.  i never wear tennis shoes to run errands in anymore, the dansko clogs are always on my feet when i leave the house.  comfortable, yet so much more professional looking than a tennis shoe!another reason i love these shoes?  they make my feet look tiny!  i'm 5'9"", so naturally, i'm going to have a larger foot than someone 1/2 a foot shorter than me.  size 9 shoes can sometimes look like clown shoes.  but these danskos rock, i wear them all the time with long boot-cut jeans, just slip 'em on and go.  when my sister (also a size 9 shoe) saw me wearing these danskos, she immediately exclaimed how small and cute my feet looked.  nice.  =)"
50074	fits well. its ultra lite. helps keep some of the sweat out of my eyes. and looks really cool.fyi - my hat size is 5 and 3/4.  i found it snug but not tight enough to be a concern.
50138	these ear warmers are very comfortable, easy to put in a bag and fold & unfold.they are also light weight enough to not cause pain in my ears, and they defend me from the chilly winds very nicely.edited in dec 2011 :i saw certain other bad reviews and i am surprised that there are plenty of 1 star reviews. i have been using this product extensively in frigid temperatures of around 10 degrees fahrenheit to protect my ears, and truly speaking, my ears are very sensitive. and these ear warmers work brilliantly for me. in fact, at times when i wore them at temperatures of around 32 degrees fahrenheit, they proved to be too warm, and i had sweat running down my ears and neck area.
50255	the spikes are easy to don on and off, provide great traction on the lake while ice fishing and anywhere else they are needed. excellent quality.
50343	when i dress up or go out i like to have my shoes freshly polished and looking nice.  this means that you do it the old fashioned way using a good old fashioned shoe polish, a rag and a horse hair shoe brush.  it takes some work but you can make your shoes look like new and it helps your overall appearance when your shoes look like you care about how you present yourself.this brush is 100% horse hair and really helps to remove the excess polish and bring out the shine.  it is big enough to hold in your hand and give you a good grip on the wooden handle to really bush the shoe but keep your hand out of the polish.  it works with both cream polishes and paste versions and if you polish your shoes often enough, sometimes just a quick brushing brings out the shine.i actually have two brushes, one for black shoes and one for brown.  i recommend this product as being of good quality and worth the money!
50360	looks great with jeans.  unfortunately i scratched the logo with my calvin klein belt so i guess they do not play well together.  i was surprised at how well these fit in comparison to the ck steel.  i prefer ck and the steel trunks are my favorite.  these might be a bit nicer than the steel although not enough to change my current shopping prefences.  the monogram and eagle design is a welcome change from my ck's and i enjoy the variety of having more than one brand of designer underwear.i got these in the navy and black.  they seem to fade quicker than the calvin klein steel's but are more stretchy.  the calvin klein stretch enough while maintaining colorfastness.  it's as if the ck's steel are thicker less stretchy but with improved color retention.  the emporio stretch trunks seem thinner stretchy but fade much faster.one big difference is the emporio's have a butt maximizer panel design.  people teased me for that.  at the time i didn't really distinguish all the small details.  i just wanted something with a bold logo around my waist to enhance my abs.  the butt maximizer it non effective on me as i do plenty of squats and other exercises for the legs.  i'm pretty thick and toned so the maximizer qualities seemed a bit artificial on me.  i wore them several times to stretch them so they fit my body better.  in the beginning it was as if the underwear was pushing into my taint area.  i wanted it more stretched on my ass not lifting and separating.  it looked funny and wasn't in place like it should be.  either it didn't cover my hips or i pulled it up to high and i had a weird camel package.  in time i got them to behave properly and when i did they contoured perfectly.  the ck steel fit right out of the box and seem more reliable.  at the time it seemed these were superior to the ck steel but in hindsight the steel wins for me.i don't like the designs that are gaudy and needlessly decorative like the eagle on the leg.  it's too much like dolce and gabbanna and i don't like the ones with decoration on the butt.  it's too over the top.  italian clothes are sometimes too flashy for me.  i would get the emporio brief that says emporio on the front but it has monogram and eagle on the butt.  while i like how revealing the micro brief is i don't want to cover my butt with logo's.  my butt is too nice to be hidden under corporate bs.  some corporate bs is good but you do not want to go overboard.  the logos on the back is more for someone who has weak glutes or saggy posterior and is trying to cover it up with flashy logos.  also that much logoing in those areas would tend to flake off or fade fast.  so i guess the more logoing, the more expensive because of perceived added value, the more you are willing to pay to cover up a problem area.  i just wanted a hot fit with a hot logo on the front so babes could see i work out and buy expensive clothes because i got the loot.  it think those more expensive pairs are for older gay men who are not in shape yet want to be sexy for other men.  or it could be young gay men who are not very athletic or sports inclined so tend to be underweight and scrawny.  instead of covering their butt up they need to workout either doing deadlifts for a nice bubble or swim to get that nice build.  i have seen pro bodybuilder's wearing these.  the more extravagant styles seem to be best suited to those that just want to buy the most expensive and do not consider application or price points.all in all these are my favorite armani underwear as they put focus on the front instead of the back.  i want chicks to dig my package not my butt, that's creepy.
50502	the crystal heart is just beautiful, the chain its pretty fine and shines! i dont know about others but i received a pretty white gift box! this is just beautiful, not as the picture looks!it came in perfect condition!
50521	out of the box this is not the most comfortable bra i've ever worn, but for the money, it is the best.  in my experience, however, it almost becomes a second skin and relaxes to fit you exactly after a few wears and washes.  great support, no seams to show through, tough elastic, a quality product. you can also pull the straps together in the back to wear with with deep sleeveless shirts so that the straps don't show.  a great buy.
50526	decent athletic bra with some options on the back.  there's a hook to make it an x back, which i don't like but it works just fine as a regular strap too.  quick dry
50539	bras are always a crap-shoot unless you try them on before buying. i was pleased to find that it fits as it should. looks nice. supportive. no weird-shaped breasts. as far as all-day comfort in an underwire bra, on a scale of 1-10, i'd give it a 7.
50544	doesn't hold tight, it keeps slipping.  my kids are pretty active, but that's the point of the strap to hold while being active.  didn't work for us.  maybe if the glasses ear pieces were thick but both my kids have wire frames.
50565	my daughter loves her black wool uggs. she has had them for several years and they have survived a lot. i like the colour of the new grey pair more than the black, since the colour is a heather grey and not quite solid. we did purchase the boot in a 1/2 size smaller because the wool foot seems to stretch easily and the boot gets roomier once the sheepskin pile inside becomes compacted. this time we purchased a special spray to keep the boot waterproof and so far it seems to work well.she usually wears the boot scrunched down over her jeans, but the boot can also be folded over revealing smaller buttons in the inside. if the boot leg gapes, the buttons can be moved over for a snugger fit.
50593	i miss them so much during the summer. they are extremely comfortable. i love how versatile they are. i prefer to wear them all the way up with the buttons exposed, but i've also worn them folder over with tights and leggings. just depends on how you're feeling. but i love the knit look and the gray color. i'm not a big fan of the traditional ugg, so these were perfect for my style, for comfort and for warmth. i've taken them on 3 trips where i walked miles and miles as a tourist, and these were awesome.
50600	this sports bra is very similar to my bravado original nursing bra double plus size.  i'm a 34g so my options are minimal and support is very important.  i bought a large.  the support is good.  tighter than the bravado bra which makes me happy.  i haven't owned it long enough to know if it stretches, which i hope it does not.  the bravado bra did.  i plan to use it as a sleep bra.  i think for the gym it would not give the best support.  i think i would need something that cups each breast better.  i gave it three stars instead of five because its a sports bra which leads me to think its designed for the gym and it looses a star since its not supportive enough for that and looses another star because large breasted ladies need sweat support between the girls and instead this bra pushes them together which leads to more sweat.  could use some cotton in there.  for a sleep bra it will work.  you may want to check out the champion womens sports bra zip as an option.  it wont fit me because i have a small waist and large chest right now.  i used it before i became pregnant and it gave great support.  its not a nursing bra but it does zip down the front so it could be a good option.
50655	i just got these the other day and played a round. the fit like a glove on my foot. i have wide feet, and usually wear a 12, but sometimes a 13 if the shoe is too narrow. i got the 12 and they fit great. the most comfortable golf shoes i've ever owned. they are super light weight and provide great grip even though they are spikeless. my only gripe is that i have a hard time paying $100 for golf shoes. once i tried them on i was sold though.
50683	"i have purchased these in almost all the colors, size 6 tall, and they seem to fit true to size.  i actually haven't worn any yet because i haven't washed them, but i am sure they will wash up just fine.  love the little bit of stretch in the material, sits at the waist and are plenty long even for me at 5'9"" tall, so i am happy!  thank you lee!!!"
50702	love these jeans.  they are soft, durable and light.  no more stiff, harsh feel.  these will be my choice from now on.
50750	i chose the 5 star rating because these jeans actually fit me.  i am over 70 and wear a size 18 - with a smaller than usual waist and a 31 inch inseam.  these jeans fit, and are of a good construction quality.  they've been washed several times and there is no shrinkage so far.  i will be buying more of these.
50849	fruit of the loom has done it again. when it comes to fit and style as well as comfort. these new mens briefs. have a lined waistband for extra comfort. and no chaffing. the blend of the cotton used in this new item by fruit of the loom.  is thicker and heavier.  than in the prior offerings. the comfort and support have been addressed as well. i was so impressed with the quality of this newer offering. that i purchased two packs. seperatly. i can see the difference and feel the difference in the fit. my two sons were so impressed with the redesigned fruit of the loom logo and waistband.  that they wanted the same for them. however at this point. i have not been able to find them in boys or young mens sizes. however i know it will not be long before the word will cath on. and fruit of the loom will also introduce these in their sizes as well.a great product at a great price. what we have all come to know and expect from fruit of the loom.
50889	i search the lehigh valley for sneakers on the employee approved list for dorney park cedar fair and could not any men's white sneakers at all.these skechers are on the approved list. they look fine and feel fine. takes a time or two to wear them in at first.
51046	couldn't be happier with these sling back shoes.  stylish and very in.  the shoe is leather and so comfortable too. five stars for this shoe and company responsible for it!
51159	"these socks feel great. i am only 5'2"" -so, there seemed to be too much at my knee, which got a little tight, but i was able to adjust slightly. i wore them on a long uncomfortable trip to the west coast. i felt great."
51172	as with my previous review, i mostly like these thigh high stockings. my only complaint is that they do not provide enough compression. i have worn compression stockings for years, 20-30 mmhg has always been plenty strong. these do not equal that.
51184	if you can get them on, these compression socks would probably do just fine.for my legs however, they were too narrow. they look and feel like winter socks.
51244	it is a very good bra and fits well (i got in white).  it just wasn't as padded and push up as i thought it would be.
51260	when we first got it, it worked great.  but after using it a few weeks, it didn't hold the money in tight enough if you got down in bills. we will probably have to buy a better one when we have the money.  i wouldn't recommend it unless you carry a lot of bills.
51364	the product looks great. me being a 34b makes the top fit funny. the chest is to big and does not fit right.
51396	this is a soft, lined wire-free support bra with good wide straps.  there are no tags, no hard plastic pieces, no bunchies, no ruffles.  it's just your basic, utilitarian everyday bra.  i am a 36c, and it holds everything where it needs to be without wires and without binding or squishing or pushing things higher than they need to go.  the lining is a good eighth of an inch thick, which may be more than a younger perkier woman needs.  as someone who attachment parented a child, i am glad for the extra coverage.the size is true, but keep in mind that this means that, if properly fitted, you should be using the widest hook setting when you first start wearing the bra.  they stretch over time, so as the bra starts to give, you move to the middle hooks and then the tightest ones.  if your old 36s or whatevers are on the widest hooks, you might want to go up a size in this one.
51407	i love this bra! it is the most comfortable bra i've ever worn. i had breast cancer and surgery about a year ago and have been going through reconstructive surgey, my doctor strongly sugested that i wear an underwire bra while recooperating. i bought 3 of these bras. i and my plastic surgeon were very impressed with the quality and support these bras give. i went back and bought 3 more! they are so comfortable i wear them even when sleeping(per doctors orders). i don't think i'll ever go back to the bras i was wearing. these bras are great.
51445	my husband said he wanted to get me some crotchless panties, but i was a little hesitant. i looked them up here on amazon, and was a little nervous about the thongs and such since i'm a bigger woman in size 30 jeans. but i found these, and although the opening is kinda big, it fits perfectly! i love the little frills on the back and my husband says it seems like it's a little bow on a present. lol. very comfortable fit, sexy even on a bigger woman... i plan on buying more from this brand/seller.
51460	i'm so disappointed with my purchase. i purchased this jacket to wear over my scrubs because we keep it cool. the jacket does run a size large. it washes well. it keeps it's color. it's just the right thickness not too thin or thick. the worst problem of all it does not stay snapped. when it gets really chilly i want to snap up the jacket, it won't stay snapped. i just have to wear it open. how frustrating. i will finder another brand jacket. i contacted the seller which they have excellent customer service. i will purchase from them again but not this jacket.
51463	i love these sweatshirts.  the cuffs will stay up on your arm when you push up the sleeves and the necks do not stretch out.  i now have 4 of these gildan 9000 s sweatshirts due to reordering them a couple times and i love them for warmth in the colder months.  they wash well, don't shrink a whole lot, and don't fade.  i'm a fan.
51467	whatever happened to those super comfortable sweatshirts with the nice soft fuzzy stuff on the inside they used to make??? i resorted to ordering off line cause i cannot find them in stores. well, same thing with this one...its hard and stiff. i so badly want a soft and fuzzy sweat shirt and pants too!
51483	these are so soft and comfortable that we bought them in many colors. we used to purchase regular hanes t-shirts, but since we have found these we won't go back. the sizes seem a little larger than our other t-shirts of the same size, so if you like them tight then you'll want to order a size smaller!  personally i like the room in the shirt, just adds to the comfort of this t-shirt!
51544	my husband took a chance and ordered these shoes online.  not only is the fit perfect, he loves the comfort insole.  the bottom of the shoe is rubber which enhances the comfort and adds stability for safety.  they go with jeans and dress slacks.  very versatile and comfortable.  worth the money for a great shoe.
51547	"update september 7, 2012:i've owned these now for almost a year and now i have to alter my rating for these shoes. i rotate the shoes i wear daily and i don't wear them at all in the winter months so these actually only have a few months of wear on them. i was absolutely loving these shoes, until the stitching in the toe of the left shoe started unraveling at a very rapid rate. they will become unwearable in the new future. they have only about 4 months of actual wear on them. i am extremely disappointed in this shoe. i thought i had found ""the shoe"".original review october, 2012i average over 10,000 steps a day on concrete at work, so footwear is very important to me. i've only worn these a few times but these seem to be a very well made shoes. they feel very supportive while having a comfortable fit."
51642	sorry, i cannot review this since i miss-ordered.  i intended to order the lo-topmodel so, i returned the mid-high one. i did love the style even though i sent it back.
51648	like all carhartt products i have purchased, this vest is terrific.  i like the durable exterior, with good reinforcement on the hand pockets, and the two convenient interior pockets.  the fit for me is good, not too baggy, which lets the wind in, not too tight to bind.  the back is lower than the front which keeps the wind out.check out their jeans as well.  they fit better than the fashion brands.
51655	this bra is amazing-the best-fitting bra i've found. the fabric is smooth and soft, the wire doesn't poke, it doesn't look like a granny bra, and it shapes the way i like. i'm larger-chested and it took me about 10 years to find a bra that i truly liked, and i'll never wear another bra. i couldn't even tell you how many of these that i own!
51812	i ordered or bought about 10-12 of this type in different colors in the last 2 years. wearing it everyday at work (food service), at home or out shopping or dancing. i wear a 38d and this bra gives me great support and comfort throughout the day. i definitely recommend it!
51824	coming in variety of colors and styles, this bali passion bra as comfortable as the company claims it to be. the fabrics used in this product are as easy to handle as the coobie strappy v-neck lace trim bras. it is an easy bra to wear, and can certainly become a must own for any woman.
51826	this bra fits in all of the right places.  the fabrics in this bra do not fade and it is easy to handle. much like the coobie strappy v-neck lace trim bras, this bali passion bra is a must own and you not disappointed from the purchase.
51890	very disappointing fit and not comfortable at all.  it was not supportive, too large in the cup area and too small in other areas.  i returned it.
51914	such a great idea but doesn't work for larger sizes.the fit is odd and uncomfortable. the petals are not in the right place for me and the straps and band are itchy. i bought two but dread wearing them.
51925	"i have been wearing this bra for years. i have always been happy to put it on, and i know i'll be comfortable throughout the day.  recently, however, i have noticed that the concealer ""petal"" inside the bra, has begun to make indentations in the bra material.  it hasn't bothered me, it's not noticeable from the outside through my clothes, and i would say if you really want the concealer feature, don't let it stop you from buying it.  since this feature is not something important to me, and since i need new bras anyway, i have just bought a different bali bra, passion for comfort shaping wirefree bra, which i have rated a full five stars."
51928	i like the fit of this, and the band underneath.  the shiny fabric is good because your tops will glide easily over it.  mine is not pointy, like others have complained.  usually bali bras in my size (34d) feel a little too roomy but this fit perfectly.  the reason i am taking two stars off this review is because the band underneath feels scratchy.  the seam where an underwire would go is uncomfortable on me.  i have the barely there concealing wire-free bra and it is much more comfortable.  it is incorrectly listed as an underwire on this website, but it's not.  its number is 4584.  barely there and bali are both made by hanes so i don't mind recommending another model in this review.
52036	nice shirt.  thin cotton material.  it has longer sleeves that go to my elbow.  i would recommend this shirt for casual wear.
52044	these shirts are high quality and come in hard to find sizes. my husband uses these to wear to church.
52052	the color is faint ,the shirt is too big cause i used to wear size large but i can't wear this shirt and the fabric is thick so i don't like this shirt
52079	this purse is slightly smaller than advertised.  it is six inches tall and 5 3/4 wide.  also didn't know it had belt loops on the back, but it serves my purpose, of having my bus pass, wallet and glasses are at my finger tips.
52120	the material is very soft and the fit is good however, i know our bodies are all different but i purchased two pairs thinking they would come up as high as on the model in the photograph and they don't. no doubt i'm a bit wider than the model but i thought they were hi cut briefs.
52165	similar manufacturing with the same style waistband and leg opening hems.  however, the fabric is wimpy and has no body to it, as well as these run large compared to the 2803s, though size 8-9 is a tad shorter from waist through crotch and back up the other side to the waist, thus it sits a tad lower on the waist than the 2803.  i am disappointed in the feel and the too much stretchy-ness.  however, they are comfortable and don't cut into the waist or the legs nor do they ride up into the butt cheeks.  the size 6-7 is smaller than the 2803, as this doesn't fit me but the 2803 style does (i'm borderline between 7&8 size)  note:  i recently got the damask barely there and find it runs a tad smaller than the smooth knit one, probably because the damask knit provides less stretch.
52171	these are the most comfortable fitting panties that i have used.  they fit snuggly without binding, but never show under your sleek jeans and pants.
52190	i love these bras. i had one for a couple of years and soon found it was my favorite bra, so when i needed new bras, i ordered several of these. they were a great price on amazon and so comfortable.
52234	no, there's no support, but it will keep you from wiggling and jiggling so much, which is inconsiderate of others in public and rather gross after you reach a certain age or weight, or both. i hate wearing bras and can't understand why anyone would want to sleep in one, as someone suggested. but i love this one. it makes me a bit more modest and works with loose-fitting clothes, around home, and for the gym. to get anything even close, you have to get a sports bra and put up with racerback straps (crossed in back), plus have your breasts flattened, which drive me nuts. this is way better. i'm ordering a second one, because i couldn't find it in stores, so want to grab it in case they discontinue it. it truly is barely there. i like their panties for the same reason.
52253	i can't believe anyone would sell this tissue-paper thin, flimsy material with the attempt to pass it off as an article of clothing, let alone a bra!i wasn't expecting a bra that would make me look shapely - i didn't care about that, i just wanted to be comfortable. and i knew this would not be a supportive bra i could wear to work out in. i just wanted something comfy that would keep things relatively in place while i was alone at home or out walking dogs and wearing layers or baggy clothes.i am completely disappointed. this is a total rip-off. this &#34;bra&#34; does absolutely nothing.  it was very inexpensive (thankfully) and is not worth returning.
52256	"i like this bra, it is soft as stated, and indeed, it does not give you the support a ""spandex"" or tighter sports bra would. it really creates a natural look, with no restraints anywhere. i got the nude color, if it makes any difference.why then did i not give it 5 stars? well, it sizes one size too big. i normally am fine with anything ""medium"" in clothing. this sizes like a large when it says medium. so if you need medium, order small.... i am not returning it, because for 7.50, it is not worth it my time and effort. i'll just wear it when it is not so important that the bra sit perfectly snug."
52297	i took these shoes out of the box last night and i'm wearing them today. i do a lot of walking during the day and i'm already in love with these shoes. my orthotics fit easily in the shoe. these shoes are very stiff/sturdy. so that said, if you don't like sturdy leather shoes i would wonder if you might like these. but otherwise the shoes are supporting my poor flat feet perfectly. good job new balance.
52416	i bought 2 fabric-only sleep bras in the uk that were manufactured in sweden, and hoped to find something similar when i returned to the us because i loved mine so much i wore them out. i got the xl, and it is way to small. it pressed into me so tightly that i think it may have led to a case of mastitis. maybe you could get away with an xl if you're normally a b cup. if you're c or above, don't even get one of these.
52430	i found this item to be just as described.  it is very comfortable and supportive.  i find that i can wear it all day without uncomfortable binding.  i will be purchasing more of this item.
52453	"i am 55 and have always had a medium build. i hate baggy clothes, especially jeans. it has gotten harder over the years finding true tapered jeans. i am a die hard levi's fan since i was a teenager. when i came across these on amazon i was a bit dubious as these are not made in america. but i like different colored jeans as well as the regular ""blue"" jean. which the 508 offers on amazon. these jeans fit well, the taper is perfect and the assortment of colors is varied enough to get me back all the colors i've traditionally worn. i've checked the department stores and not been able to find the assortment or in many cases the 508 line. so once again, amazon to the rescue. order today, here tomorrow, if you have prime. and you should have prime.these jeans fit well, wear well, i love them. so far i've only bought 6 pair, which should say something. try em, you'll love em."
52485	i found this sandal too heavy and was not expecting it to feel so heavy on my feet.  it's nice looking and seems very well constructed but just not what i was looking for.
52547	they seem bigger than i expected, but decided to keep them as i can wear them with some thick socks.  they are comfortable, though i expect that due to the material of the clog your feet would get sweaty quickly.
52559	i love these boots.  they are so cute and fit great.  the calf is adjustable, so it you have on bulky socks you can adjust it out if needed.
52583	this boot was nice enough to look at but the sizes are not correct at all. the size 8 was closer to a size 9 1/2 or 10. also, the print looked like it would get scratched easily. i returned these and got sloggers instead. they are true to size and the colors are brilliant and go all the way thru the rubber instead of looking like they were painted on the boot. also...sloggers are made in the usa.the company that i purchased these from were very nice and there was no problem returning the boots. i also got my credit in a timely fashion. as always it's a joy to deal with amazon and their suppliers.
52664	purchased this to waterproof( stainproof) my gals' suede boots. after a few applications, the boots still look like they are out of the box, but water rolls right off.. so when they get wet, no worries about water marks or salt stains.if they get more than water on em, rinse off and good to go.. i bought 2 bottles so i can reapply after a month or two.followup a year later... ive tried other less expensive waterproof products but none have compared to kiwi  ..just bought two more bottles after wasting money on a competitor product( melatonian) that just didnt work at all.  changing rating to 5 stars.. wont ever try any others...
52762	the casio 200 meter wr sea analog illuminator is a fine dive watch.  it has the required screw down crown and back, a curved crystal face to help with readability, superb (and i mean superb) illumination system and that also includes before you press the brilliant light button.  very pleased.  the bezel is a bit tight but it seems to get better with use.
52769	another watch bought out here that didn't work upon arrival. its just not worth re-mailing back over and over loosing shipping. sorry i bought this. not as described. not even close.
52782	i got this watch for my brother for his birthday. i liked it so much that i ordered one for myself on amazon. i did not get it yet. i got his at walmart and amazon was less expensive. this is a great watch with gadgets !!! it tells when fishing is good and the moon phase and the sunrise and sunset and has a time stamp and is good looking and an all round great buy and great casio watch !!!!! i cant wait to get mine lol!!
52796	"in 1989 i was working as a production carpenter. i had been through numerous low priced digital watches. all worked well and performed their primary tasks well, (time display), right up to the time that they broke. after buying a nice, high-priced seiko for my wife on her birthday, she asked me what she could get for me. i told her that what i would really like would be a ""bullet-proof"" watch. i had heard great things about the ""g-shock"". the next thing i knew i was wearing one.my first one, which is still running 18 years later, and on only it's second battery, turned out to be the most dependable multi-function time-piece i ever owned. it served me through years of construction work, diving and surfing, exercise laps in the pool, kayaking and rafting rivers in california, idaho and montana. oh yes, being an unpretentious person, i also wore it to weddings and social events.alas, recently the outer protective shock case finally succomed to the elements, cracked and fell apart, leaving the stainless steel case exposed, but still working, and still attached to the original strap, and the watch still works.it seemed prudent to retire old faithful and replace it, with a newer,  upgraded model. thats when i ran across this attractive and versatile beauty. the price was right and i was intrigued by the ""solar power"" and ""atomic timing"" features, so i went for it.the casio gw330a-97 is attractive, extremely comfortable, and very eye-catching with its space-age design. with casio's g-shock reputation, i have no reason to expect less than the best in rugged and dependable performance. now that i have learned how to program and access the many functions that this device offers, i am very stoked to have it, and all it offers, at my command.the negative: this watch is not for the technically challenged. i downloaded and printed the six-page user's instructions from the casio web-site, and then spent parts of the next whole week trying to learn how to operate this techno-monster beyond basic time-keeping. it took alot of time and a bunch of trial and error before i finally learned to operate this device without constantly referring back to the multi-page, fine-print instructions. kind of a pain, but i was determined and i have finally become the master of the instrument, instead of just a frustrated observer, content to simply read the time. the triple-eye display, showing various status and features, activated or de-activated are impossible to read without good lighting and a magnifier. not good for someone with tired eyes. still, once you have the watch set up the way you want it, there's really no reason to check them out again, with the exception of the power-status meter which can be read easily enough. they do look kinda cool though!the positive: this device offers a wide array of features and functions suitable and versatile for the most demanding needs. if you don't mind taking the time to learn how to use it, it will become one of your best friends. it's water resistant to depths beyond the reach of all but the most intrepid professional divers. what this means to most of us normal people is that, along with it's legendary shock resistance and durability, this watch will stand up to and survive just about anything you will put it through, like floods and thunderstorms, even hurricanes. the newly designed square access buttons have been recessed into molded receivers to avoid inadvertant activation. they are a bit more difficult to activate than the older exposed buttons of past models, but to compensate, they have little grooves built in so you can use your finger nails for pushing if you need to.i'm a great believer in solar power, and this device seems to have a superb, space-age solar power system with a long-life battery back-up that boasts up to a 6 month reserve capability. it can be charged in any kind of daylight, sunlight or artificial light. obviously, the brighter the light, the better the charge. i find direct sunlight to be a bit harsh for long term charging and i recommend avoiding any light source harsh and hot enough to temporarily blank out the lcd display. i left it to charge in a bedroom window for several hours once, and although i am sure that it received a good charge, the watch got very hot and the screen was blank and blacked out. the instructions advised about this situation, and after about 5 minutes in the refrigerator to cool it off, i was relieved that everything returned to normal with no apparent damage or negative side effects. i use a desk-top bullet lamp with a flourescent tube bulb now for re-charging overnight now, and this seems to be the best and safest method. very bright, cool, intense light. since i began that, the power meter has never moved from the fully charged ""high"" setting. outside direct light from a cloudy or overcast sky or on a cool day for a few hours will also give the power reserve a quick and long lasting boost. whatever charging process is used, it's a good idea to avoid any light source that will heat up the device. other cool features: power-saving modes that puts the watch to sleep in the dark when the user is sleeping. and a very well designed back-light that can be used either ""on demand"" with a well placed, finger-sized button, or set to briefly light up automatically when you turn your wrist up to view the face of the watch. to save power, as may be appropriate during repetitive motion activities, the auto-on backlight can be turned off, using the same button. while in the power saving mode, the back-light can still be activated manually when needed. very functional, original and well thought out treatment of the ""backlight"" concept.atomic auto-time-keeping: i tested this feature at night, as recommended by the manufacturer. i was able to successfully re-set the time manually, and automatically, following the instructions, and by simply aiming the watches radio receiver antenna out my bedroom window. the process worked perfectly in both modes. to let you know how well it worked, consider this: the ""atomic clock"" signal originates in colorado, northwest of my location. i live in san diego in an area where we get no am/fm or tv signals at all, because of the surrounding foothills. the window i used faces the south. the signal from colorado bounces off the ionosphere at night, but directionality can still be a factor. even so, when the watch went into ""reception"" mode, manually and automatically, it pulled a full powered signal and re-set day-date-time-year in a few short minutes. it really works! very impressive!there are 4 separate alarms available, plus a snooze alarm. (i hate alarms!) there is a traditional split-time stop watch, count-down timer, and even a 30 event one touch event time recorder. so if you want to be able to refer back to the time that something important happened, like if someone crashes into your car, a simple push of a button marks the date and time and saves it for future reference. it will save up to 30 separate events.oh yeah! let's not forget, this watch has true world time zones. once the correct time is set, (using your home zone), you only need to manually adjust it to the time zone you are in, when travelling, using a pre-selected major city for the zone, and the watch will automatically adjust to the correct time for that zone. when you get home, just change it back to your home city and it will automatically adjust back. this watch is so smart! traditional features are automatic adjustments for 30 or 31 day months, daylight savings time, and even for leap years when they occur. and it is programmed to do this up to the year 2100. don't think i'll be around to see that. and no batteries to replace!this is a very smart time keeping gadget!to sum it up: i'm kind of a nut about techno-gadgets so i got a kick out of learning how to operate this device. now that i understand how it works, i really dig it, and it's nice to know that i will always have access to the correct time when other sources have failed. at least until e.m.p. bombs take everything out. if that ever happens, i still keep some mechanicals around, wound up and adjusted on a regular basis.at any rate, this is a very cool time-piece/gadget. it has a futuristic but uniquely quiet style, and at the same time avoids the flashy show-off looks of other less versatile brands. extremely comfortable on the wrist! i believe that it will prove to be as durable and long lasting, (""bullet-proof""), as the g-shock line has become famous for. i recommend it highly to anyone who has the patience to take the time to learn how to use it, and the need for a tough, durable, dependable and versatile time piece. it's packed with alot of technology and requires alot of button pushing to fully utilize all of it's functions. but after some patience and time, it all falls into logical and redundant patterns that become easy to remember, the more often it is used.for people who may be intimidated by complicated access and adjustment routines and sub-routines, or who just want an easy to use digital watch, designed for light duty use, a simpler, less expensive model may be a more appropriate choice. in either case, you can't go wrong with casio.bottom line: the casio g-shock atomic solar gw330a-9v is a great, multi-purpose and durable time-keeping device, available online at very reasonable prices. a great gadget for gadget lovers."
52834	i liked the clock ... the only bad thing is that in the back of the watch is a bit scratched i think that's the same belt that has been scratched, the rest all well received in time ... the only thing was i had realized that this bordered on the back by the same brush belt ..
52852	i have read many of the reviews about the problems of adjusting the band. true there are noinstructions, but just looking at it, it is not hard to figure out how to adjust the linkson the band to size for your wrist. i used a small awl with a good point and it fit into thenotch on the clip that holds the links together. there are four on each of the bands.it only took me about 5 minutes and i got the correct fit for my wrist. as far as reception, havehad no issues with it. i live almost on the edge of the site in denver. but it still capturesthe signal and adjusted the time. the only difficult part is the tiny print of the text in themanual. larger would have been more helpful. i like large heavy watches. always have. it makesthe watch look more expensive that if it were smaller.
52865	this is a watch that gives you a great service,is extremely accurate and you only have to change the date once every 4 years so is realy a perpetual calendar and i use this watch for acuba diving to 120 feet with no problem.no expensive watch will give you this service and the battery ia available everywhere and i change it myself,the only thing missing is a light but i still give 5 stars this is a great watch and is not made disposable,i have seen this watches been repaired at a fair price.
52878	i've had this watch for seven years and it still works just fine and i haven't had to change the battery yet. i use this watch when i go for a run or just hang out with friends, it feels comfortable and it is light weight. this watch has alarm, stopwatch and can hold up to 30 phone numbers and lets you type the name of the person too. this watch looks good and has a smooth finish. has a green light and you can have it set to 24 hr or 12 hr setting. i am surprised that it is not expensive. it is not large or small, it's just the right size for anyone with a thin wrist. classic watch and looks great.
52918	"i got this dress in the purple color and let me just tell you, it is perfectly lovely.  it's a bargain for the price, too.i ordered this in a 2x and then just had it altered to fit.  once the alterations were done, it fit like a dream.this lovely dress does show off your curves, but it does so in a very subtle and elegant way.  it's both conservative and quite sexy, to tell the truth.the chiffon overlay and prongset crystal trim are both subtle, and don't really call attention to themselves, yet they add so much to the look of this dress.  it's so classy and elegant, it's like something you'd have seen women wearing to parties in the mid-20th century, and yet, it really doesn't cry ""retro"" at all.  it certainly does say ""classic"", yet it doesn't cry ""throwback"".as you can see, i really love this dress!  so, i strongly recommend it.  so many of the reviewers here say many wonderful things, so if you are looking for a great dress, you might not need to look any further."
52934	my husband needed a new pair of laces for his dress shoes and we were surprised at how challenging it can be to find them in stores.  we took a gamble on these and were delighted by their quality and strength.  they don't have that waxy, slippery texture to them that guarantees that your laces become untied several times a day.  we'll be buying more.
52938	footgalaxy offers a variety of shoelace styles to fulfill all your shoe-tying needs. these round laces are my favorite shoelaces in the world: they are extremely well made, have extraordinarily tough aglets, and are very reasonably priced. these laces seem slightly larger in diameter than typical laces, and are almost assuredly better than the laces that come with a new pair of shoes. even though flat laces generally stay more securely tied than round laces in my experience, these round laces exhibit no tendency to come untied without provocation. (if you want flat laces, footgalaxy also makes those, though i have not personally used them.) these laces always have always outlasted the shoes i have put them in.the laces are very reasonably priced, but shipping a single pair is pricey; i recommend buying a few pairs at the same time to save on shipping charges. the people at footgalaxy have come up with a wide variety of colors for you to try, so feel free to experiment.i highly recommend these shoelaces.
52944	i own a pair of mid-hiking boots from keen and love them.  very comfortable right out of the box and so are these low hikers.  the toe box has plenty of room and i've never jammed my toes in either pair. i tried a couple of other brands first put the fit was not right.  i've learned to order a half size larger than my normal size for my hiking shoes.
52959	love my new keens!!! love the color and style. fit perfect with a pair of my nice wool socks. very comfortable.
53081	i love the way they feel, they are so soft. but they due run a bit large. order a size smaller if you are skinny. got them in 2 business days.
53191	i like these stockings. they actually stay on and don't slide down like other ones. they are relatively comfortable and best of all really cute!
53231	unlike some of my other shirts, this one requires ironing nearly every time.the size fits well.  i'm 6'3 and sleeves are always a problem.  the 18 36/37 is plenty long
53238	15 32/33 has a huge trunk/body.  please add more sizing info to the product description!  is a slim fit available?
53243	i bought this watch a few years after giving away my timex ironman (to someone who needed it more than i did), trying to find one i liked as well, and i have to say this one fits the bill. it's very comfortably sized, the band doesn't pinch, and best of all, it's proven itself to be very watertight, and has suffered no damage from being worn while bathing two small children.edit: dec 30, 2012i have now had this watch for almost four years and it is still going strong, even with the abuse it's seen. with the arrival of a third child, it has suffered through the indignities of spit-up and feeding messes, many additional baths, the occasional run through the washer and dryer (after i've needed to take it off, stuffed it in a jeans pocket and then forgotten to check said pocket before throwing the jeans in the washer), more bangs and drops than i can count, being used as a distraction for a cranky baby (i can't believe the glow function still works), and even being dropped in a few garden beds and mud puddles. really, i have to wonder if dropping it in an active volcano would damage it; certainly, nothing else seems to phase it. the band is even still as good as new! if i ever have to replace it, i'm definitely going to try to find another of this same model.
53289	"finally got a chance to test these boots out in ""real"" snow conditions (more than an inch or two) and am pleased to report these boots met my expectations.the boots are large (as expected for snow boots) and the materials and construction seem very solid.  that being said, they are not heavy frankenstein's monster castle-shakers!  trudging through knee-deep snow, they were pretty light and if i got out of breath it was because i'm out of shape, but not due to these boots being too heavy.  additionally, it was about 10*f outside and my feet stayed warm with these boots and one pair of regular socks.  i wore these boots withguide gear fleece - lined cargo snow pants blackand never had any snow penetrate in so my feet stayed warm and dry.  i also got these boots because i didn't want to have to lace anything up with snow boots, and what i love about these boots is how easy it is to just slip my feet in with little hassle.  taking them off is a bit more effort and sometimes my socks stayed behind, but that's no big deal.as for sizing, i wear a half-size and if anything, usually round up, but based on reviews, i stepped it down a size and that worked out perfectly.time will tell how well these boots hold up in terms of wear and tear, but i think the quality vs value on these boots is excellent for now and would recommend them."
53329	i bought these for a cruise we recently went on. i love them so much i am going to make sure i have two sets (in different colors) of everything! they make packing easier and more organized.
53356	i thought these would be too small but these were a great size for my 18 inch suitcase.  i was able to layer all of my underwear, sleepwear etc in this small size cube.  i think the medium and small size are very versatile because you can tetris them in your suitcase by turning them to fit more cubes.
53378	small and light weight but with lots of pockets. ideal for a day of sightseeing when you just want to carry a few necessities.
53388	small enough but the front pocket not useful at all. if you put something in the front pocket it bulged out a lot, so i never use the front pocket, useless... over all, just a ok bag.
53399	for quick convenient packing and unpacking. no more searching through all your clothes to find the piece you're looking for. it's just in the cube with all similar pieces: pants. blouses, underwear and socks etc. these cubes have totally reduced all my packing stress and each one can be packed to the brim.
53418	i bought these because of the ratings and price. the build quality and attention to detail are top notch. they are exactly what they were described as.now that i have them (and a nice catalog) i see that they have some items that would suit my needs better. the haste is my own doing, and i am not sending these back. i'll just look forward to another purchase soon!!!
53497	this purse has a lot of room for being a small compact bag. it is easy to carry.  colors offered are great!  i have bought three, one for myself and two as gifts after using mine for several months.
53505	i have so many bags but this is always the one i prefer. it's so comfortable to carry, plenty of room in there, and it looks nice! i have the orange and the tan. they're both great. you can where it across your body and you don't even know it's there. or you can shorten the strap for a less casual look. lots of useful pockets and tough, easy-to-clean material.
53513	this is a great every day bag that looks casual but smart. durable and plenty of pockets. the color shown is a little deceiving as the bag itself is darker and more of a greenish kaki than the sandstone color shown. overall, it's really a great purse that can be thrown around without everything falling out or suffering damage.
53516	this bag is awesome.  i got a purse for christmas and i love it, but it's just too big.  i don't keep that much in my purse except a wallet, and maybe a book or two.  plus, it was hurting my back to carry around.  i bought this one so i could sling my purse to the side and because it looked interesting.  the pockets are all very convenient and i love the front pocket!  it's large enough to hold a kindle with a case on it. this is a great product for those who don't carry around a whole lot of stuff in their purse.  if you usually carry a lot, then this bag may be too small for you
53558	perfect for traveling and even for organizing some drawers around the house. fit nicely in those corners of the suitcase. i have bought several sizes of these and love that when i open my suitcase, everything is in a bag and organized. love that.
53566	"overview:i travel a lot for work... usually i travel every week for work and for a long time i did not see the point in packing cubes.  i was content just stuffing my bag with as much stuff as i could.  recently, i decided to give these packing cubes a go and i have been pleasantly surprised at how much more efficiently i can pack.  these really do make your bag much more organized and they do compress your clothes down a bit so you can squeeze a little more in to your bag.pros:1. different sizes for different uses... small and medium are the most useful for me so far. the large bag is pretty big so it hasn't been useful for me yet as most of my trips are less than a week long.2. compression... these little bags help to compress down the contents if you put a lot of stuff in them which will give you a little more space in your bag3. material... these are very light and slim bags.  normally with bags and travel i opt for heavier duty fabrics/etc.  not so with packing cubes... you want something thin and light.  these will take up no extra space in your bag which is a good thing.cons:1. none that i can think of.conclusion:these are great packing cubes, especially for the price!  i have found a number of ways to pack with these.  i've used them in rollerboards, backpacks, and duffels.  i was skeptical at first but after using them i can honestly say that they really do help for staying organized while on the road.  typically i travel with two medium packing cubes and one slim packing cube for mon-thurs travel.  during my trip i empty my packing cubes and then as i use up my clothes i put most of my dirty clothes in to the same packing cubes and then whatever i don't use i put in the remaining cube.  this is great cause when i get home all i have to do is empty out my ""dirty clothes"" cubes to be cleaned while my clean clothes are neatly tucked away in another cube."
53609	i love these packing cubes, they make planning out clothing for a trip easy. they are durable and i even was able to steam clean them in my dryer after my most recent trip. i can be super obsessive compulsive when it comes to packing and these cubes help to &#34;manage&#34; my ocd. i will likely purchase all of the sizes since they would be fabulous for organizing other items like emergency items in your car. the handle on the top of the bag makes it easy to clip a karabiner to it and attach the bag to a backpack or purse. the largest of this set can fit a normal sized skirt suit. i really cannot say enough about how much i love these cubes!
53638	these are great packing cubes. i purchased the grasshopper color to compliment my eagle creek packing cubes. the material and the dimensions are slightly different than the eagle creek but i use both interchangeably. the mesh is great for both seeing whats in the cube and breathability. i recommend packing cubes to anyone using carry on luggage and/or wanting to be organized.  i use the medium sized cube packed in an osprey backpack for an entire weekend away. handles a 2 dresses, 2 capris,4 shirts, bathing suit and cover-up, underwear, swimsuit with room to spare.
53656	i ordered a set of these cubes for my sister last year and she raved about them.  so this summer, since my family was flying to las vegas on united for a 4-day trip, and because united charges $25 for a checked bag, i needed to maximize packing for my carry on.  i was very pleased with the packing cubes.  i used one for undies/pjs, one for shirts, and one for shorts/pants.  you can fit a lot of stuff inside one of these cubes, and it made packing and unpacking a lot easier and more organized.  i ended up only wearing half of the stuff i packed, but it was nice to have extra options.
53662	recently started traveling again and a friend of mine had some on our trip.  everything looked so neat and well organized. when i got mine in, i had opportunity to use it right away and loved them!  i packed an overnight bag and saved so much room.  i fit more into a tote bag then i have ever fit before and i can pack! i am going on a trip for work and will use them for that too.  i have tried two different ways.  1. i pack everything for one day in a cube.  i had a long skirt, long sleeved shirt, sweater, scarf, underwear, socks and i still had more room! i am a big girl so my clothes are not small.  i used one to pack all my toiletries but then i found the ebag for that! if you travel you will love these packing cubes.
53677	you can use these bags for all kinds of things while traveling...not just clothes.  i used a couple of bags to store cable and books, to sort laundry...i even carried my dirty laundry to the lavanderia in rome.  it made my bag search in the airport in milan far less intrusive.  i don't thing the security guys really wanted to mess up my suitcase.  he said, &#34;wow, you are very organized.&#34;  ha! the bags are well constructed.  zippers are substantial.  they are a bit heavier than rick steves packing bags.
53698	i'm happy with the watch's appearance. it's unique and elegant without being too flashy. so far every thing's good.a little warning is that the blue tool sold on amazon to remove watch links will not work with this. i had to find that out the hard way. i used a tiny screw driver (very tiny, more tiny than the ones that come with a glasses repair kit)  to remove the links. if you don't have the tools then you will have to go have your local jeweler do it for a fee.will update on quality if anything happens.update 8/28/11: just want to update that i have been wearing this everyday and left it on during showers but nothing is wrong with the watch so far. it still looks like it did the day got it.update 1/9/12: increased from 4 to 5 stars because this baby is still going strong and looking new.update: 8/25/12: well this watch finally gave out. the face cover of the watch fell off and there are noticeable scratches where i often bump my arms into the wall and random places. the watch still runs, but obviously no longer usable lol. for the price i paid i guess it wasn't a bad investment.
53705	this is the only watch i wear. why? because it has the functionality i need. i am a heavy computer user & suffer from severe eye strain. i bought this watch because of the 'timer' functionality.you can choose a number of preset timers & it will actually continuously loop if you want. i have it preset to 25 minutes so that an alarm sounds every 25 minutes which reminds me to stand-up, relax my eyes & refocus.additionally, the watch has an alarm, stopwatch, a setting for interval training & a world clock. for $20, you can't go wrong.
53874	these were very comfortable for walking and sitting. they even looked nice enough to wear to restaurants for dinner. i would recommend them for the stretch waist band also.
53893	these bras are very simple and functional; the lacy bit at the top doesn't really change that. i can wear them under a deep v-neck and they look fine, but based on the pictures i was hoping for something a bit prettier. i don't like to wear them with sleeveless tops because they make the pudgy spot under my arms more obvious. they are comfortable to wear for hours. i wear them to work in a professional environment and at the gym. would prefer if i could choose the colors in the pack.i am a shade under 5'2&#34; with a wide chest and muscular shoulders (hence binding under the arms and pushing up my fat is a common problem for me). i'm barely a b-cup and even when i exercise i don't actually need the support of a bra; i wear them because of our culture's prejudice against the natural and varying shapes of female breasts. i am looking for modesty and comfort in my undergarments and these bras do the job. if you need real support and/or you are prone to uni-boob they may not be the thing for you.ladies: when posting reviews of clothing, please include information about your body type!
53898	i won't be wearing these for running, but for yoga and walking they are great.  very comfortable bras that wash well.  the simple cotton and thinner straps are a nice alternative to heavier sports bras.
53907	these bras were very thin, obvious show through! i mean really bad! i've worn unlined bras with better concealment. i'm a 34c and by the reports, i expected them to be supportive enough for hiking, but have to say, these bras were not supportive enough for walking up and down my stairs. i was bouncing and bobbling all over the place. perhaps i prefer the tighter support of a sports bra, or just used to it, and in comparison, these were barely better than no bra at all. for those people who hate bras and constrictive clothing of any sort, might like these. i don't. and, the fabric was itchy, coarse and not soft in any way. the neckline, was really low. i don't need that much cleavage in a sports bra, and i think the lack of coverage may add to the lack of support in this bra. on a side note, they are not racer-back, so look elsewhere for that.
53918	i bought these hoping to find a comfortable bra to sleep in and lounge around the house. when they arrived i was excited because they were just as pictured. however, they went downhill from there. after washing them once (in cold water) they shrunk an unbelievable amount. i bought a size 36 and after the wash they were skin tight, leaving red lines in my skin. i ended up giving them to my sister who is a 30/32 because they fit her. secondly, there is no adjustment on the straps at all. finally, these bras seem to have little to no elastic in them. they don't stretch around the band and are consequently very uncomfortable. i am sorry i bought these bras because they are essentially useless to me.
53930	i'm no dolly parton, but i still didn't expect these little bras to support me very well while riding my horses, but i'm pleased to say that they do.  i also hike three miles every morning and, although going bra-less for decades never bothered me, i now get annoyed at the girls' slightest jiggle against my t-shirt.  problem solved with this simple little bra.  it's so comfortable, i can forget i'm wearing it which is rare for this old, bra-burning, 70's hippie!
53950	the black sports bra's color faded very quickly.  the other two colors were great and didn't run or absorb other colors.  other than that, they were exactly what i anticipated.  other reviews were right, buy a package that is bigger in size than you are used to.  the ones i bought fit okay, but a bigger size would have been a bit more comfortable.
53987	lots of packing space.  so much space that my duffel weighted more than my wife's larger duffel.  she always packs more than me!  four stars because used only once and don't know how well it will &#34;hold up.&#34;  also, handle won't stay locked in the up position.
53992	be careful not to fill it above 50 lbs. it holds a ton and is very easy to wheel around. the extra pockets were helpful but there are too many little pockets to actually use all of them,
54003	i get a little bored reading review after review of people bitching about bags that get destroyed during international travel.  if you buy a $50 bag, you are getting a $50 bag.  let's be realistic!that being said, we bought two of these and took them to europe.  5 flights total and although they are a bit dirty--they are pink, so we expected this and scotch guarded them, they are in pretty great shape for the abuse i knew they went through.  one of the handles malfunctioned after the first flight, but then started working again.  these bags are super huge, you could fit a body in them--really.  probably best for local travel, but we are pleased!
54018	"i bought this t-shirt in 5 different colors- white, black, royal blue, ash, & light steel. i wear them for pj tops, primarily, but also for layering.  i was expecting ""comfortsoft""(hanes trademark), but that's not what i got. i only wear hanes underwear, and mostly, their short sleeve t-shirts.  i buy them under the ""comfortsoft"" label, as they're very comfortable, wash well, and are very durable.  these ""tagless"" shirts are not!  they're made of a heavier weight cotton, and they're somewhat scratchy, right out of the dryer. they did fit well, right out of the bag, but started shrinking, the first time i washed them. the white one, in particular, has shrunk in the arms to where they go half-way up my forearms. the others haven't shrunk as much, but are very snug right now, and i can't imagine how much longer i'll be able to wear them. i've only had them about 6 weeks. incidentally, i came back to amazon today, and searched for ""comfortsoft"" long sleeve tees.  i found some, from a different supplier, but there was a note at the top of the screen that i had ordered these previously.  when i put some in my cart, and went to check out, they had surprisingly changed from ""comfortsoft"", to ""tagless"", so i deleted them.  i guess i'll have to find them somewhere else.  i am very disappointed in hanes right now."
54021	bought two long sleeve, navy blue shirts for my husband for work. (he has to wear solid navy blue undershirts and it's been cold recently so i went with long sleeve. we bought this brand and also soffe (?) brand. i didn't think about the tagless feature when i ordered this but i should have. i had tags. we always laugh about underwear that has tags (i mean women's underwear - why put tags on these???) anyhow, the shirt was super comfortable and he likes it. the other one wasn't terrible but it did shrink a lot in the dryer and this one didn't - so that was awesome. good shirt; would buy again. haven't had it very long but expect it to hold up through lots of washes this winter.
54136	"i have several pairs of sheepskin boots: one uggs classic tall, one ulu portillo, one ulu leather outer with sheepskin inner, and these emus...we need the warmth for northern vermont winters.i agree with one reviewer who mentioned the superior soles and arch support, definitely more than uggs, but they not quite as comfy as uggs in the trade-off. i also found that they are fairly true to size after ordering a 9 for my 9.5 foot...hope they'll stretch some and am fairly confident they will. the emus are also a tad clunkier than uggs classics, but for the $68+free shipping i paid for these twin-faced sheepskin boots it was just fine (gotta hit amazon just so to get the really good deals).when purchasing emus, make sure you order a ""premium"" sheepskin boot or what you get is merino wool.  merino is fine for warmth, but falls into clumps after some wear as the wool is not actually part of the upper as it is with twin-faced and is separately attached to the outer part of the boot. the regular emus are fine for a fashion boot, but when looking for durability and long-lasting footwear go premium and spend the extra money.very happy with my toasty emus."
54252	i now own at least one pair of each of the clog style crocs.  this one is comfortable when doing a lot of walking.  it is not a shoe to wear when it is warm as feet are likely to get sweaty.  the lack of vents/holes makes it less of a warm weather shoe.  the trade-ff is that this particular style looks more like conventional clogs, making it more suitable for the office place.
54259	i liked it as i expected ,,,,,,,,,,,its so nice to have n wear/pin it , outdoor or casual or formal
54268	very sexy, the material is nice and not cheap.  fits well.  thick silky material and not a thin cheap one. you can probably order a size down so it doesn't look baggy since the style is already meant to be big in the arms. thanks!!!
54454	this product is terrible!!! (charles barkley voice) i put them on and the top part stretched out immediately and kept falling off! i had to walk and hold them up the whole entire time i was wearing them. i am 125 lbs, this shouldnt even be
54548	this item is very flattering and very sexy! you've been warned! i will be ordering them in white too! i wish all my online purchases made me this happy.
54560	i bought 3 for myself and gifted another. i like the fit - i'm a little overweight at 5'3 and the large fits fine. have had these for a year of washings/dryings, and they hold up very well with little shrinkage. good price. also, the red, is more of a strawberry red, very pretty.
54581	"fits nicely and does what i want it to do, which is to keep the chill off me on late summer/early autumn nights. there's nothing fancy about this jacket, and that's reflected in the price. at one time, lightweight nylon jackets like this were a dime a dozen and easy to find, but it seems everything now has to be brand name or tied in with some sports star or rap artist. and of course, you pay for that accordingly. but this jacket doesn't carry any logos or celebrity names, and does what it was originally intended to do...keep you warm. i'm 6 ft. 3"" and just under 200 pounds, and the xl size fit me just right. wash it on the gentle cycle and use cool to cold water, and it should give several years of service."
54690	i took a chance on buying these considering all of the negative reviews, but i am very glad i did. when reading the reviews i happened to notice that most of the two stars or less ones were from a couple years ago and the more recent ones were better. i thought what the heck i'll take a chance on 6 dollars. they fit my sons disney, carters, and faded glory onesies just fine and all three fit the medium size extender. maybe the older product didn't come with the three sizes of snaps? whatever the case i'm so happy i took the chance! i think i'll even purchase another for a friend!
54736	i love and own many many black wardrobe items like most of us. i did not have a black cotton what i call an oxford style shirt. most days you find me in a white oxford shirt and jeans. i did not have a black shirt and began my search. the shirt arrived quickly and i am delighted with my purchase.  it is nice to add color to my white shirt collection.  the shirt is priced very reasonably.  do not let that stop you from purchasing.  i have washed it several times and you will need to iron it. i will definitely purchase again.
54752	looked great when just received.got black fast and didn't clean up with silver cleaner.its just a fashion chain. was pricey for a fashion chain
54916	not a &#34;love&#34;, but that's probably because i was expecting too much!  i don't have the perfect body, but these jeans look as good as they possibly could on my body.  i guess i wish i had a better body to put them on!  they are good quality, fit as expected, have a nice stretch to the fabric but are still sturdy.  will buy again.
54923	i've always loved levis! these are no exception. make sure you order a size up from your normal size, and they will fit perfectly. they have some stretch, which makes them very comfortable. love the skinny jeans look. these are great for tucking into boots and wearing with a tunic or long cardigan. have fun with these. i know i do!!! :)
54936	i read all the reviews and most of them said they were like jeggings. i think they are more jean like than jegging but that could be just me. they do stretch, but not what my other 'stretch' jeans do. i ended up ordering a juniors 11/ or 30medium and they fit. generally i wear a 29 or juniors 9 depending on the brand. i'm 5'8&#34; and there was a lot more fabric on my ankles than in the picture. going to roll them or have them sewed. overall they are cute . i havent found a pair of white jeans to fit me in stores so i was pleased.
54962	i bought 3 pairs which are very different. indigo affection 3 medium (99%cotton,made in china) - it fits more like jeans. im comparing it to abercrombie & fitch's superskinny (size 0 short). i like this  better than the a&f because the back pockets on these levi's is located higher than a&f which in result makes my butt look more lifted. i don't recommend order the colored version though because the fit is very different. indigo sky 26 medium (88%cotton i believe)-this one fits more like legging with very thin material. i got a 3 short instead of medium not sure if it is mistake or the way it should be but it fits good. i might keep it. white superstretch, 3/26 m - it fits more like jeans (98%cotton made in pakistan) but really long. compared to the other indigo affection 3m this is more like a half size smaller and much longer. i'll have to alter the white one if i decide to keep it. still thinking...
54965	"as a 5'4"" hourglass-shaped, petite-legged lady, i'd ignored the skinny jeans trend because i looked as if i was walking on pins.  they made my hips look extra-wide and my legs extra-short.  well, enter the levis 535 jean legging!  amazing.  they don't gap at the back of my waist, so i don't have to wear a belt.  they never sag even after repeated wearings.  they look svelte and skim my knees instead of hugging them, resulting in a nice elongating shape.  plus i can buy them in short!i'm usually a size 8 petite with a 31"" waist and 40"" hips.  in these i am a 13 short.  who knew i could ever wear juniors' pants again but i hope these never go out of style, until they go out of style.  thanks levis!!"
54978	i had to wash them i m 5'1 and 120 so they bunched together at the bottom of the leg's. and they are white with rain cant wear them so when its not raining out comes the white pants and now that i washed them in hot water the fit better maybe a size smaller and shorter they run long and they do run tight just be careful on long wise..
55001	my wife was looking for the above for her exercise classes; could not find product locally; arrived promptly; she liked it - enough said.
55020	based on these three positive reviews and i did order this bra.  it is perhaps not the best design for a larger breasted woman.  the cups did not hold their shape, the breasts flatted out and became a very unnatural shape.i'll be sending it back.i think a c-cup or smaller would be fine, but in a dd-cup it's just not enough support for me.
55036	this bra seemed perfect--well designed and supportive. when it arrived, i was excited. it appeared well-constructed with comfortable material and double-stitched seems. then i went to try it on, undoing the cheap plastic zipper in the front. the zipper broke immediately. this was probably lucky for me. that plastic junk zipper could not last long, and better to break when i could still return the bra. but what a waste! a nice high-quality item rendered useless by cheap zipper.i also have to agree with other reviewers that the bra does run very small. however, that could be fixed by simply ordering a bigger size, if the zipper worked. if you were truly committed to this product, you might order a size big enough to comfortably pull over your head and thus avoid both the zipper problem and the sizing issue. would the larger bra still be supportive enough? maybe. however, i will just suck up the return shipping costs, and find another sports bra.
55148	i like them very much and so my two daughters.  the 3 of us wear them, they look elegant an the style is very pretty.
55175	first off, i am a guy. these studs (1 cttw=.5 ct per earring) look perfect to me. they are not too big and not too small. i have average sized ears. i like them to be subtle which they are and not obnoxious. they have a nice shine and a classy look.i don't feel like a rapper which is good and the studs pair nicely with a black suit.
55185	my wife has sensitive skin and see are perfect... no worries with the metal messing with her. good stuff. smiles
55198	i got these as a christmas gift for my best friend, they were so cute i wanted to keep them for myself! she loves them and shows them off to everyone she knows.
55259	these are beautiful. i love them the shine like the real thing too. i love that they are platinum, too. i would recommend these to anybody that has pierced ears. they are lovely.
55277	these are beautiful sparkling earrings. wear dressy or casual very good deal for the price. the photo of earrings are exact
55284	these guys are big and unless your jay-z noone is going to think they are diamonds. if you are looking for something that will be seen from 50 yards these big ladies are for you!!
55304	i would have given 5 stars if the inner sole part of the sneaker was glued down..it was not..the inner sole is the part your foot sits on..i can see this inner sole sliding, shifting and twisting inside the sneaker after long walks. i will glue it down myself...but this sneaker is very comfy, good arche support,,,i am 6 foot tall and have seen too many buffet lines at casinos...wink
55308	i disagree with sizing comments completly.i wear a 10, always wore a 10 since hs. i ordered these at 10.5 because most every review said to up them even a full size.well, they must have got their act together because this 10.5 is to big and i wish i just ordered my size of 10.other than the the shoes are great.
55322	this avia walking shoes are perfect.  the price was right , and they will be going on my vaca.!  i would recommend this to every one.
55365	this hat is cute, but it runs small... or i guess i have a giant head (i am only 5 ft 5) but i guess i have a bigger head than most.  its very snug on, and once washed (but not even put in the dryer) it is now way too small and wrinkled.
55367	overall, this hat is very versatile. it is a nice style, and the brim can be worn up or down (which i prefer). it has an inside cord for adjusting, and it is generously sized.i wear a women's hat size l, and i frequently have difficulty finding a hat that is not too tight. this is far from it. in fact, i would say anyone who wears as s or m in a hat should probably pass on this one.that said, i was disappointed in this hat. all the glowing reviews are well-deserved, i am sure, but i found the hat to be too casual, crinkled, and mis-shaped. looking more closely at this hat, it's obvious that the quality in construction just isn't there, which partly contributes to the problem.sadly, it gets returned and the search for my perfect sun hat continues.warning - amazon is not honoring free returns on this item. be prepared to contact them for return shipping credit.
55425	i love how these socks have stretchy woven elastic across the top middle, it keeps them from moving around and losing their shape. they are very comfortable and true to size.
55427	"oh, women's socks; how many times have i been disappointed?  too many to count.  but not with these; these are good socks.  they fit well, are cool enough and warm enough, not too tight, not too loose, not too much synthetic fabric and they wick away moisture effectively after exercise, unlike others i've tried, because they do contain some cotton.  they also have a little ""snugging"" structure woven into the top of the arch of the foot to keep these very comfortably snug; the sock ""hugs"" your foot, so these socks don't slip and slop.  put them on and they stay in place all day.i just ordered two sets, but think i'll buy some more while these are still available.  they're great for everyday wear, but also a very good golf sock whose top hits exactly at the ankle bone.  highly recommended for fit, comfort, and quality (yay, champion!).  i'm buying more right now...update 12/21/13:  done!  just purchased two more sets.  get them while you can!update 12/26/13:  fyi, here's the fiber content, as per the stamped-on label (curious minds want to know):63% cotton31% polyester3% natural latex rubber2% spandex1% nylon"
55520	i ordered a pack of l, cuz my mom its 10, well the l sizes are like a size 14 ve carefull
55586	as expected, these shirts shrunk up a bit. this just helps drive me to continue to drop the lbs lol.  i still enjoy the product and will buy more in the future.
55595	i love the tint. very relaxing. and they make me look either super cool or like a big jerk. but seriously, happy with them. however, all of these types of glasses fit some nose bridges better than others. so buy 1 and see if you're comfortable with it before buying multiple pairs.
55649	as always, these naturalizer flats are so cute.  they look great with jeans or for work.  the stonewash color is unusual and eye-catching.  the fit is perfect and they are so comfortable.  i highly recommend this shoe for anyone seeking style combined with a great wearing shoe.
55693	these luggage tags serve their purpose admirably by being solid and instantly recognizable on the luggage carousel.  however, there is a secret as to how they work, and if you are not forewarned (as i was right here on amazon) you are likely to break them.  a tiny illustration showing how to separate the pieces would do wonders -- they open like a fan.  i would recommend these with the caveat that you must be careful and take some time to learn how to use them.
55698	these tags are made of tough plastic with a rubber-like strap that snaps close to attach it to your luggabe handle. all you do is take off the strap, swivel the top around, put your name etc on the card- making sure your name appears in the window (i printed off our names and address on white printer paper, using small font and it fit perfectly and is very readable. i also put a piece of clear packing tape over the paper in case the little plastic window cracks) it's nice to have just our names visible instead of all our information. then swivel it back around, put the strap back on and you're all set to go. highly recommended.
55717	this is a good product, it came on time and i didnt have to wait long with anticipation. it was well packaged...and not to mention  my girlfriend loves it!
55735	i have this is various colors because they are comfortable, no skin reaction and i like the length. hardly know i have them on as far as comfort level.  what i am not understanding is why the yellow pair from gem avenue is not free  with shipping over $25.00. i was going to buy the yellow but why pay for shipping when i have not paid for the other 5 pairs i have? that i don't get, otherwise i like the earrings and gem ave has been a good vendor thus far
55751	as other reviewers have stated - these don't cover much of your foot - mainly just the toe box. and i found that i had to shuffle around in them to keep them on my feet. i ended up returning them as they just felt too wide - for reference i wear a 7.5 and bought a size 7. otherwise the slippers themselves seem to be made very nicely - good quality leather, and plush lining.
55809	im not a big fan of ugg boots. they are pretty unattractive, but i love the wonderfully warm shearpa lining and decided to give emu's a try. they are just as well made as uggs but the styling is much nicer.i initially purchased the lighter color on sale for 55.00 at [...] and loved the boots so much, i wanted to purchase them in black, but the sale was over and they were back up to 79.00. (they are over a hundred dollars on other web sites)  i searched the web for the best price, and found an even lower price here on amazon (41.00) a great buy for a beautiful pair of warm boots! some helpful info....these boots run a full size larger. i wear a 9, and ordered them in an 8 after reading the reviews, and they fit perfectly with a little room to wear a sock without it being too snug. they are lined from the top of the boot all the way through to the toe. the calf is not too wide, not too snug...(i have average calves) just right for tucking in leggings. mine have a flared bottom and still fit well without looking 'stuffed' into the boot. (i am sure jeans would tuck in easily too.) they are also advertised as waterproof but i havent had an opportunity to find out how they are in wet weather yet. the top can be worn up, or folded down to show the shearpa lining...a great look either way.if you like the look of uggs without the 'ugly', you'll love these boots! happy holidays everyone!update on these boots:  im sad to say that these boots didnt work out so well afterall. a button looped broke on the first pair. i love the style so much, i contacted amazon for an exchange. to their credit, amazon was extremely accommodating, issuing a ups pick and sending me out a brand new pair. within three wearings, the  exact same thing happened to the second pair. i was hoping i just had a defective pair the first time, but now i realize its all in the workmanship. i dont know whether those button loops are glued onto the boot or sewn, but either way, the attachment is weak, and any resistance will pop the loop off. beautiful boot, and terrific in every other way, but its basically useless if you cant keep it closed. i am going to try the bronte/stringer pull on design because i love emu boots, but the workmanship on this particular design is in real need of improvement. i wonder if the more expensive boot in this design, paddington, is made better. anyone know?
55815	love the straps and the slight flared heal on these shoes. very comfortable. the  shoe is soft and flexible. great for dancing.
55820	order these shoes in a wide width expecting them to fit like &#34;normal&#34; shoes. i would normally wear an 8.5w in dress shoes, but these do not fit as such. they were so tight that even with stretching over time, i don't think they would have ever become comfortable. next time i order ballroom dance shoes i will try a double w width.
55831	um somehow didn't get this one they didn't have my size or something  it was either wrong ad or something nothing bad just don't know why this is showing up for review?????
55893	very hot! i love the way it looks. my only problem is i'm a small and the waist on this thing is very loose, as if it doesn't have a waistline. i definitely will need to take it in on my sewing machine. the rest of it fits great though. :]
55936	i got these for my girl because they match the necklace i gave her. even though she usually wears earrings that dangle i thought these would look nice on her and they do.
55951	i bought this necklace for my wife's stocking. i buy her a necklace every year for christmas its kind of a tradition.  this necklace was slightly nicer then the amber butterfly i bought her last year.my wife opened it and you could not help but see how happy she was with the product.  it fits well on her. and as she was looking for something new to wear. brings a smile to her lips when she puts it on.it seams to be a great fit and has beautiful work. the only down side is the clasp is really small and hard to work. we are getting her a new chain to go with the amazing pendent.i would recommend this as a gift for any one trying to make there purple loving wife happy, as i was.a++ love it!
55959	"these are well-made, durable, comfortable pants.  the black hold up to numerous washings without fading.  they are attractively cut, with a slim, but not skin-tight, fit through the hips and thighs.  i have a 29"" waist and 37"" hips and the size 9 fit me perfectly.  the inseam is 32"".  if you wash them in woolite dark extra dark care, they'll last even longer without fading.  have purchased several pair and i really hope that amazon and beallsflorida will continue to carry them!"
55977	very cool style but very fragile. they bend very easily. no scratches yet. havent broke yet but i'm sure its coming...
56003	i love these shoes.  you can wear them with and without socks and not look like a dork or wannabe hippie.  they are like crocs but more versatile and stylish.  no complaints.
56104	the necklace is gorgeous and it came rather quickly. the only thing is, it does not look exactly the same as the image. it's not completely different but there are small differences. beautiful, nonetheless.
56133	these socks are fun and cute.  the colors are lighter than in the picture.  i wear them to work and have gotten compliments for them.
56147	i got my first bellaband last week and already i know i want another. i got a little panicky this morning when i couldnt find it! i love anything that allows me to continue to wear my regular pants and its very well made.i am 15 weeks right now, and normally a size 8 and their size 2 was the right choice. i expect that i will continue to get tons of use out of it in the coming months. the band has enough give that i know i wont need to get a larger size later.at least at my current size, i prefer to fold it in half and wear it over the top of my pants. the material feels smooth and supportive against my skin and i have not experienced any rolling. its not a plain cotton tube top - the material is smooth, but its thankfully not slinky or slippery. i contemplated getting one with a lace edge, but because i like to fold them i think the simple smooth edged version might be better for me.
56206	let me start by saying i've been looking for my perfect boots for months now, and i can say i've finally found them. what i was looking for was:- rugged, sturdy sole- good quality leather (waterproof)- style with practicalitylexiss boots fit the bill! but let me tell you, i had to order 5 pairs of these boots to find the right size and fit! i'm a pretty solid 10 but these boots in size 10 are more like 11.5! after trying on 10, 9.5, and 9 (all in wide fit), i finally decided 9 fits me best. my calves are about 16 inches, and 9w was a bit hard to zip up at first but the leather does stretch, even after wearing the boots at home for a couple hours. another thing i noticed is that the fit of the brown color is not the same (a bit tighter) as the leather is different (more like nubuck). p.s. size 10 of these are eur 42, and size 9 is eur 40. i'm normally eur 40.5-41 but these boots definitely do not have standard fit.update: i ended up returning these boots. the zipper kept damaging my sock (every time i zipped, it created a hole in the sock), and i just decided overall these boots are just too heavy-duty. i need something a bit more feminine.
56222	this bag isn't very big.  if you want to use it for all your bathroom products think hard.  what i do, is i use 3oz. bottles for my body wash and shampoo so that i can put it into my carry on luggage.for what i use this bag for, it is perfect.  carries my razor, shaving soap, shaving brush, toothbrush, toothpaste (again, i use the small bottles for travel) and hair cream.highly recommend.  very classy item.
56225	"i'm so disappointed in this shoe. it's one of the best-looking in new balance's very ugly line. it seemed sturdy and well-made. but the aa runs wide in the forefoot.since i have narrow feet, i have to order all of my shoes online. in new balance, i usually take an 8.5 aa. i ordered the 993 in 8 aa and 8.5 aa. at first, the 8 aa seemed to fit perfectly, but as i walked around in them at home, my toes pressed against the front. it was very slightly too short.the 993 8.5aa seemed to fit acceptably in the heel and across the forefoot, there was space in the front but it didn't seem too terribly long, so i kept it. however, as i wore it, my foot slopped around in the forefoot. no amount of inserts or prosthetics helped. the 993 was lots of $$ wasted.i've stuck with new balance because i have found shoes that fit properly in the past. but it's been a long time since i've been able to find new balance shoes that fit, and this is one of those failures.i deeply believe new balance designers failed to take into account the lack of padding in the 993 and cut the forefoot oversized as usual. the top of the forefoot is some stretchy nylon-like material. consequently, an aa is larger in the forefoot than your usual narrow ""standard"" forefoot.i believe new balance is no longer serious about sizing shoes for narrow feet. ""total fit"" is just a marketing slogan."
56236	the new balance men's mr993 is an excellent running shoe, the construction is very high to outstanding quality, the cushioning is excellent and the design is also excellent. the shoes are made of high quality leather and mesh. the shoes are very durable and comfortable. this is a very high quality product and is made in the usa.i have previously had new balance shoes that were made in china and they lasted a long time, but do not compare in quality to the mr993.jon green
56243	one of the most exciting running shoe concepts to come long in years. no one category of our population puts more miles on running shoes than the us military. available in all miitary service livery models - the new balance 993 military series should be a hot item for some time to come.new balance has been an american made running shoe that i've worn since they were available in military exchanges in the late 1980's/early 1990s. being flat footed and pronating is not a good combination for a military career. my feet gave me problems with most running shoes i purchased until i found the new balance 99x series. can't remember how many pairs worn out over the years. now retired - the comfort these shoes brought make me a lifetime customer.when an internet e-mail notice informed me of this model's introduction i was eager to buy a pair that proudly indicated my army legacy. this model is sold out at post exchanges for a 3 month period june/aug 2011 so i went elsewhere to purchase them.they look sharp and do not disappoint the pronating runner - keeping the new balance heritage for yet another generation of military runners. still too new for me to know how well they wear over time - i'm hoping my overall experience and those of others will keep new balance american workers employed for many years to come.
56252	this classic nb 993 has perhaps the highest quality materials both inside and outside the shoe. there is real suede leather and thus the increased weight of the shoe. i own about 20 pairs of running shoes at this point ( way too many) so i can make some comparisons. my top 2 running shoes are the kayano 17 by asics and the brooks trance 10. i see reviews that this shoe is for over pronators. it actually feels to be to be made for mild supinators. the shoe is neutral when i add my sole moldable insole and take out the stock insole. its a practice i highly recommend for most running and basketball shoes. there have been very few shoes where i thought the stock insole was good enough to leave in. with all these reviews mostly positive i'll add my 2 cents. this is a shoe that goes beyond just running. its a cross trainer, a walking shoe, a treadmill shoe, a trail shoe a work shoe and can be used even for other sports like basketball. its got stability good cushion and just feels good on my feet. there is no other running shoe i would dream of playing basketball in but you can get by in these although i wouldn't make it a habit. there are some complaints about the upper wearing out near the toe area. i do not recommend using these with cotton socks as this increases the coefficient of friction. these will do best with a synthetic acrylic sock made for running. i use only the sole socks as well and very seriously doubt i will get any wear though on the uppers. again do not use cotton socks. a good rule to follow for most sports. is there any one thing that is truly outstanding-- not really. its the combination of things that nb has incorporated into the shoe that make it a jack of all trades. it still a running shoe but it can do much more. i really appreciate this shoe and look forward to this shoe lasting a long long time.
56254	"how difficult it is to make a boot that is both practical and elegant?this boot top has a potential but the bottom is one of the hitler yungen gang uniform look,the boots from ""thomas crown affair"" that looked so great on catherine, were very similar  similar but alas so different from that production."
56321	i had been searching for a messenger/field bag on ebay, but wasn't finding one i wanted within the price range i set. so, i came to amazon, and this was the first one i saw. i read the reviews and decided i would try it. i ordered late saturday night, and it arrived tuesday morning. i like the bag, and the color(i ordered olive), but i don't like it as a purse.
56349	"just bought several new keds in white, black, navy, bright blue and red to replace the old keds that i bought 20 years ago! and my ""old"" keds are still for perfect for yard shoes, knock around shoes etc! my new keds in white and black are of leather and how comfortable and easy care they are! the bright blue, red and navy blue are canvas and washable. all are just wonderful and looking forward to another 20 years service. since i was a kid, i have lived in keds sneakers for the comfort, looks and the fact that they last and last and last. they are all worth every penny that i paid for them. thanks keds, hope you never change!"
56378	i love the brand keds and wanted them in this color couldn't find them in the stores so i ordered them on line. i am very pleased with the shoes the leather is soft the shoe is comfortable as always.
56422	this is a great purse. it is soft, light-weight leather and feels much more expensive than it is.  the many pockets and zippers make it really easy to stay organized.  the phone pocket is perfect for my phone, but may be a little small for a larger phone.  even if it is, there are other convenient pockets that can be used for a larger phone. i love this purse and would definitely recommend it.
56446	i loved my original tevas, but when the velcro wore out i bought a pair of these hurricane 3's.  they were horrible.  i held teva is such high esteem that i wondered what could have happened to such a good company.  the soles are hard, thin, and flat and feel very unnatural when you walk in them.  the front strap digs into your foot, too.  i returned them and bought the terra-fi 2, which is actually the more common teva sold in the stores.  it is very comfortable.if you're considering buying the hurricane 3, make sure you try them or the terra-fi 2 on and walk in them in the store first.  amazon has the same average rating of 4 for both, but in my opinion the difference is night and day.
56483	these earrings are an intense teal color. they absolutely glow. every one of my friends have complemented me on these. i lost one earring, and had to immediately buy another pair. my only despair is finding a matching ring or necklace!
56496	the turquoise color only appears when the earrings are in sunlight.  otherwise, the color looks closer to navy blue.  i still like them and wear them.
56581	this product arrive on time and it very spacious.it will definitely hold books and my daughter's lunch pack in it.she adored the look and the pink is great.i love this product.
56587	soft and light. really keeps your head warm. i tried on the carhartt acrylic &#34;watch&#34; hats but they were nowhere near as comfortable or as attractive. i have an average size head and there is still room for a larger head. plus it also covers my ears comfortably.
56600	i received the umbrealla really quick. the size is perfect for my 5 year old. it covers her head down to her shoulders and she likes the fact that she can see thru it.
56607	keeps rain off way better. it's really small (duh it's for kids) but i'm a small adult and enjoy it. definitely can't fit two under it ..
56756	these were beautiful boots and i loved the lower part of the boot: the square toe, harness, heel, everything! but sadly i returned them because the shaft looked rather absurdly huge on my apparently scrawny calves. i could only wear them over jeans or skinny jeans but not under as they stuck out. leggings or dresses were out of the question because these just looked enormous on my legs! if it helps anyone i wear a 6.5 and have 12.5 inch calves. i have a pair of frye taylor boots that fit my calves wonderfully. awesome boots, just not for me.
56759	these boots are amazing!  i bought them in the tan color, and wasn't expecting them to be already distressed-looking since they didn't appear that way in the photo.  when they arrived, though, i was pleasantly surprised to find that they have that broken-in look already to them.after reading a lot of reviews here on amazon and elsewhere, i decided to go with the common advice of ordering a half-size down, and i'm glad i did.  i usually wear a 7 1/2 in boots and shoes, and the 7 fit perfectly. what i read on-line said that you know you have the right fit when the heel area is loose; they will eventually mold to your foot, and you will no longer feel your heel sliding in them, which is exactly what i found to be the case.i also had no problems breaking them in.  i wore them around the house for a few hours over the weekend, out for two hours yesterday, and wore them for eight hours on my feet teaching today -- and didn't need to put on my back-up shoes that i had brought with me (expecting that these would hurt after a while).  they were comfy and great all day!these are almost a cross between a motorcycle boot and an equestrian boot -- and they definitely are smokin'!  i got compliments on them all day today, and love how classically stylish they are.  while the motorcycle look is currently trendy, these boots have such a classic look to them that i know i will be able to wear them for years to come.update 3/20/10:  just wanted to update my review to say that the more you wear these boots, the more broken in and comfy they get.  every time i wear them, i also get so many compliments on them!  a friend of mine from work also mentioned to me that she's had her frye boots for about ten or fifteen years, and they are still going strong.  she's had to get them re-soled a few times, but they look great after all those years.
56782	it snuggly takes care of my boys when they need it most. maybe a little on the pricier side, but only the best for a gentleman's gentlemen.
56789	i had not needed one of these since my little league baseball days! however, i needed one recently and found this to be a comfortable choice. i highly recommend because i did not have any discomfort issues even wearing 18 hours a day.
56849	this watch was easier to set up than previous waveceptor watches that i have owned. you simply choose a city in your time zone and the watch instantly changes the display to the correct time. you can also get a time sync 4 times a day instead of the old limit of one. surprisingly reasonable price. comfortable to wear. very readable and informative display.
56984	i bought these for my daughter to put in her big easter basket. they are true to size & look like good quality. i know she'll love them!! very very very cute!
56986	these boots are amazing and soo cute my daughter fell in love and shes soo happy there very nice couldnt be better
57062	i don't normally like buying shoes online. i like to try them on first to make sure it fits. this was the first pair of shoes i bought online and i have to say i'm glad that i bought it. i love this boots! it was worth the price and the wait. it fits perfectly and love the fact that it's flat!
57064	"note: i love my shoes and my boots.  and i will try anything in fashion once.i got these in the hunter green and the coloring was gorgeous.  i slipped them on and they fit okay, but they hurt the soles of my feet!  the design of the boot is nice- slouchy, relaxed- great to be paired with rolled up jeans and/or a lazy skirt... presumably.style:- the boot came up mid calf.  i have long legs (36"" inseam), but i've found a few pairs of boots that reach my knees at least.  these came up to mid calf, which had a way of cutting my long legs in half, making me look awkward.  i tried to pull up the ""foldover"" part of the boot and even with that up, they still barely reached the bottom of my knee cap.- the slouchy design is wicked cute.  i wished these fit me right.- the rounded toe and the flat foot paired with the slanted rise of the front of the shoe for the top of you foot, makes the shoe look like an elf shoe.  (especially in the green color, unfortunately.  i maybe should have picked a different color for my first steve madden flat boots)comfort:- the sole of the boot is really hard.  the foot casing cuts into the backs of my heels/ ankles.- i ordered a size 8 (which is my typical sneaker size) and they were a little big for me.  if you're borderline sizes, order down.- there was plenty of room for the calves, even when the top of the boot hit right in the ""meat"" of my calf muscle.- the shoe is so flat that it actually hurts my foot.  there is no arch support whatsoever.  could be just me, but i guess i really can't do flat boots.  if  you have high arches, these aren't the shoes for you.shipping:5 out of 5- i got these shoes within 3 business days during the christmas season.  i ordered on a thursday, one week before christmas, and got them on monday, before christmas.  fantastic. no damages to the packaging.  they were in their own little plastic sleeves, stuffed with foam and cardboard to preserve shaping.  then they were put in a shoe box, and put into another box for shipping.  great service.the style of the shoe is cute.  the idea of the shoe is great.  the reality of the shoe is not so much.  i will be returning these and looking for a different style of boot.  :)"
57101	the shoes were beautiful and simple for a wedding, but they were so narrow that they actually hurt my feet the second i put them on.  i can't imagine wearing these all day walking around in my wedding dress, so i immediately returned them.  after reading other reviews, it looks like calvin klein shoes all run very narrow, which makes me sad.  i'm a big ck fan across the board, but never again will i buy their shoes. if you have long, narrow feet, then these will work well for you, but if you have slightly wider feet, try something else.  i ended up getting cole haans, and they fit perfectly.
57137	mesh backpacks do not last very long. my son is required to use one, and i usually buy 4 or 5 per year because they rip very easily. this jansport seems more rugged. i am hoping it will last the year. none of the other brands have.
57140	it is light, it is long, it is harmless and looks real. i got it from amazon as an accesory for elegant pirate lady jack's girl. look the costume up there is an image of the whole outfit. great buy!
57157	these are more comfy than crocs. they have a removable liner. as comfortable as my asic sneakers! received two pair (black and brown) in two days. i was going to use them for night-time slippers, but am reconsidering for daytime too--they are just that comfy on my average-wide foot. wear size 8.5-9, and the sz. 8 fit perfectly. the strap is nice to use as a heel strap, although not needed.
57158	comfy but not to pretty.  they do serve the purpose for which i bought them .  when i am on my feet a lot they work
57267	i am 5'2 1/2 and these babies make me a super model at 5'8 1/2. i do however strongly suggesting getting a bigger size than you normally wear. i wear a 7-71/2 and i ordered these in a 7 and they were way too small. my toes hung over and my heel stuck over the edge which is unheard of for me wearing a 7. i then reordered a 8 and they fit perfect.
57296	so far every pair of shoes i've gotten that are for water sports need to be one size smaller! works great. no complaints so far. fast shipping too.
57358	these are the original rigid shrink to fit jeans.although they are made in some foreign savage country, they still do the job.
57428	i bought these for my husband and he loves them. he says he wouldn't wear any other brand of jeans because these always fit perfectly, are very comfortable, and last a long time.
57479	i have big runner's thighs and decently sized calves.  it is hard to find a good pair of jeans with this body type.569s were my most affordable go-to jean for a while that had good fit and sizing, but over time, i (and my wife) found the style to be way too baggy and unbecoming.  having a more attractive fit on the calf to ankle area, the 559s seemed like a natural progression, so i ordered a pair of these in the same size as i had for the 569's. (36x32)using my normal size, they were way too tight on the seat, groin and thigh, albeit the waist size was fine.  i returned the pair and went up in one size (from 36x32 to 38x32) and they were a great feeling fit, but now the waist was way too loose!  normally i could wear proper fitting jeans without a belt, but these were falling off and risking crack exposure!with a belt, and one size up, these are just right.  not too tight or skinny to make it look like i wanted to emulate a millenial, nor were they too baggy that i out myself as a gen x'er stuck in the 90's.  a good go between, if flawed, if you have big thighs.
57493	i don't need designer jeans to be satiated with what i am wearing.  these wear well and one can easily wear these a hundred times without so much as a rip or tear in the fabric, and that is taking into consideration rugged use.
57501	i have been wearing 509s for a couple of years now.  i ordered 2 other styles with this order.  those 2 were exactly what i expected; however, these 509s have excessive fabric in the front.  it's almost like they were made in reverse. i fully understand these are loose fit.  but, big pillows of fabric between the zipper and the pockets looks really strange.  perhaps these are made for guys with a gut below the waist but they sure aren't what they used be.  and as other reviewers have noted,  the fabric quality has really deminished.i rarely order clothing, shoes etc online.  the odds of something not fitting or being different are just too high.  however, the special amazon ran included free return shipping and sure enough they honored that.  levi's  may be going downhill but amazon is still the worldclass leader in online retail.
57642	these jeans are great if you can find the right size.  a 8m fits me perfect while a 10m is snug as heck, shouldn't it be the other way around?  picking the right size is a crap shoot as sizes do not seem to mean a thing.  trying these out in the store and picking the correct fit seem the only way to go.  what is up with the inconsistent jean sizing levi's, your about to give women of the world an eating disorder!
57665	"i'd almost given up on finding a pair of jeans that really fit until i discovered 515s.  they fit like a glove - not too stiff but also not ridiculously stretchy/flimsy like a lot of jeans these days.  these are just a solid pair of real jeans that fit a woman's shape and are true to size.  the ""short"" option is perfect for me, and i'm 5'4"".  also, the bootcut isn't overdone; it's just enough to add balance to your overall look.  the one negative is the worn-in look of the jeans.  why is this in style?  i want a consistent, solid color for my jeans.  these look like i've had them for over a year.  does anyone think this looks good?!  ok, any genxers or boomers, that is?  i didn't think so.update: after wearing these jeans a few times for one month, i've found that they actually do stretch out over the course of the day and end up looking baggy and frumpy.  maybe i need a size down, but then again, i have this same size in another pair of 515s (which i bought in a store), and they don't seem to have the same problem.  hmm..."
57719	i'm six feet tall, and the long are perfect. there is a bit too much spandex in them though. they fit perfect the first five minutes, then tend to get baggy. the material is on the thinner side, but they are very good jeans. i ordered an additional pair.
57831	for some reason petite and short pants are now to long for me. they used to fit just right. i just had these hemmed and they are great. it's not their fault i pick up cat and dog hair. ha
57895	these jeans are amazingly comfortable with the slight stretch built in.  the fit for me is great.  i wear an 8 and have very slim legs.  i like the boot cut best.  my tummy is never flat and these jeans do a good job of firming it a little bit.
57907	it fell apart after 2 months of light usage.  i literally wore the shoes 1-2 times a week.  apparently the glue holding the front rubber of the shoe was applied very poorly.  i emailed dc customer service, and they just gave me a copy and paste response saying their warranty only covered the shoe after 30 days and that i was basically sol.note to others:  spend your money on a company that makes a quality shoe and that will back their product.
57955	these are the most comfortable and most flattering jeans i have ever owned. my only problem with them is they run a little small. i am usually an 18 and had to get a 20 for them to fit properly, but the exchange was well worth it. they make my rear look great, they are comfortable enough to wear all day without cutting into my midsection, and best of all for us bigger girls: no muffin top!!!! yay!!! they are also the perfect length for me. i am 5'9&#34; and i like my jeans to just touch the floor behind my heel with sneakers on. most jeans are too short, especially if i make the mistake of putting them in the drier, & i usually have to buy talls & hem them. not these! they are the perfect length, maybe even a tad long. :d i wear these everywhere now & i will soon be buying other colors. i will never buy another brand/style of jeans again.
57984	these jeans fit perfectly and are very comfortable.  some other &#34;curvy&#34; jeans i have gap in the back at the waist, but these fit just right.  the color is nice, too.  i will definitely be ordering more.
57988	i like these jeans but they seem to run large and are very long and you shouldn't hem jeans until you have washed them a few times because they can shrink in length...so if i buy more i will try to size down one size to fit better.
58036	"these jeans are great ! they fit perfect (i'm a size 14, 5 ft 1), look and feel good. some ""petite"" jeans are way too long and some are just too short but these are the right length to wear with sneakers as well as with a small heel. the material also feels just right and i'm absolutely thrilled with the prize. a great buy."
58126	levi's are a great fitting jean. with a lil bit of  stretch they fit the body like a glove for us curvy women.
58178	i purchased 2 different pairs of these. this pair did not fit so well it seemed to run a bit small. the other pair was same style just different color and they fit much better. overall a good price and buy for me. was shipped quickly too.
58218	dont get me wrong i love to be comfortable with scrubs but these look like im wearing a tent!  if your into the shapeless unisex you wouldnt mind these.  not only do i look shapeless, when i bend over you can literally see my undershirt(all of it).  yes i tried a size down and it was too tight!  it just doesnt feel right, i feel slouchy and unkempt.  i like to look professional and put together, not tight, not loose, respectful fitting put together scrubs is what i like and these are not it! double yuck!
58236	i order 2 pair of levi's jeans both size 9m and this pair fit comfortably if not loose versus the other pair that were skin tight, but these. these were too long and they don't have a short available.  they are going back as are the other pair that were too small.
58260	these jeans are great!  i love them so much that i came back to see if i could order them in other colors (and i can!)  i'm 5'6&#34; and about 165 pounds, and i got size 30 medium.  so very excited to have these.
58462	they seem to be good value for the price compared to the expensive designer boxers.  i expect these will be very durable.
58494	"i wish i'd stuck with the ""name brand"" crystal products that are much more beautiful.  i'll give this to someone young as a gift and not be ashamed, but it is not large enough for my taste."
58517	these earrings were given to me as a gift and they are a huge disappointment!  theyre very pretty but the posts are much wider than normal posts and they don't fit in my ear holes.  also, the end is very rough which hurts.  so i am debating on returning them.  don't buy them unless you normally wear wide posts in your ears.
58533	i purchased two sets with necklaces as well.  the stones are a nice size but they are way too pale for my liking.  the appear grey not green.  i went ahead and gave them as gifts because time was running out before christmas otherwise i would have returned them.
58551	i was afraid these would be too light, but they are a lovely, delicate color, and definitely green.  and the cutting is just beautiful.  the setting is also very nice.  would prefer them to be just slightly larger, but for the money, it's a great deal.  i have also ordered a pair of peridot earrings, so i can wear a darker green when i wish.  but these are just right for some of my apparel.
58555	i bought a matching citrine pendant to wear with these earrings but they came up very different in color. citrine of these earrings is almost white. very little tint of yellow. i don't think they are just like in the pictures. now i don't have a matching set. other than that the rings are nice.
58574	these were for my sister in law for christmas - this is her birthstone and she  told me she loves them.
58590	i have had many compliments on these earrings. the color and shine is fantastic, they really sparkle. would have loved them just a little smaller, even with long curly hair these are a standout!
58679	i had looked  at inexpensive sports bra with a front zipper for easy wear and found it at amazon.com, the source of many of my purchases.  i bought a black one and a white one for my yoga class.  probably not enough support for running but perfect for light activity.
58693	i have been a boxer and boxer-brief man for many many years.  however, i have switched from the roomy carpenter style blue jeans to designer jeans that hug my body.  my boxers were always bunching up in the legs, so i decided i wanted to switch to a no-show brief.  i ordered two pairs at first, just to try them out.  again, after being a boxer man for so long, i was not sure i could make the adjustment.  surprisingly, these 2(x)ist men's essential no show briefs turned out to be very comfortable.  the waist band is a perfect size and the stitching around the legs is perfect.  the waist band in the front does dip a little low, but then the waist on my jeans (true religion brand) dip a little as well, so this is not an issue for me.  overall, these 2(x)ist men's essentials are comfortable and well made.  i have subsequently made additional purchases and plan to buy some more.  fyi, i am a 31 waist in blue jeans and i purchased a medium in these briefs and the fit seems to be true to size.
58701	this coat gown is generous in fit, soft, washes up beautifully and comes out of the dryer with no wrinkles and packs easily. i would suggest going down one size if you are between 1x and 2x. the color is exactly the way the photo shows and is a deep hot pink color.  i bought the matching nightgown as well and the same can be said about it as the petals robe.  it is comfortable enough to wear around the house and especially when visiting friends and you want something to throw on quickly to make those bathroom trips in the middle of the night or answer the door. the style is rather matronly, and is  suitable for mixed company or when you need something simple to wear while getting coffee in the morning. i find them both to be very comfortable and soft, although a bit slippery.
58710	do not order from this seller, it takes many weeks to get your item (thats if you get it at all). then when you do finally get it it is so cheap it rips out before you can get it on your head!!!! cut off a nylon stocking before you buy this it would work better and hold up better!!! terrible waste of money, they do not respond to emails...
58729	"i got this to carry a large, heavy laptop, both for day trips and on the plane. planes allow one ""personal item"" as well as a carry-on suitcase, and this fits the bill for the personal item.it is a cute design, light, sturdy and well made. the price is right, too. highly recommended."
58731	"i'm an active grandmother. i shop on foot and use public transportation.  i've been looking for a cart that will allow me to buy more when i'm out shopping without the burden of carrying heavy grocery bags. i wanted an alternative to those metal ""granny"" carts (squeaking wheels and too big). this is it...goes where you want it to go with ease (empty or full), holds a lot, does not tip over, recessed wheels, recessed handle that is easy to get to, handle long enough, sturdy zippers, exterior pocket, waterproof, 10 year guarantee. i keep my recycled bags in the exterior pocket, have the checker fill my groceries into the recycle bags and put them into the rolling tote. i like the big polka dots. if you're driving, the cart collapses and stores in the car trunk. this olympia tote exceeded my expectations. i'm delighted with it."
58754	i purchase it as a gift.  they say never buy a lady a watch b/c it means its time to go!  however she loved it and become my main squeeze.
58784	a small feels like a medium in my opinion, my waist size is 29 so you get my drift. maybe an extra small would be better. i like the quality material. thats about all i can say.
58788	for a shirt that is designed for law enforcement and to be worn, presumably, over a ballistic vest, these run pretty small...uncomfortably tight through the shoulders and especially the armpits.
58789	the big difference with the 5.11 polos over the competition is weight. these are a much more substantial weave of fabric and for that reason also a bit warmer in summer. while they do have a few extra features, they aren't that useful in a non-military or lef role.good shirts, heavy, warmish.
58885	my husband's comment on this tunic was....wow! seems well made and the beadwork is intricate. i usually order similar tunics from a couple of other website and this one ran larger across my bust than my others (i have over a dozen). still its better to have a little more space than be too tight! the product was just as attractive, if not more attractive, than the picture on the website. wish i could say the same for the model.
58887	this is a very pretty kurti, but i would look better in it if i could get the static cling out of the material,  it clings and doesn't hang right.  i am keeping it and hope to figure out the problem
58890	this is a great invention. i am 6'1&#34; and 175lbs, lean athletic build. the medium is a good fit for me, but keep in mind, this is a compression type shirt. at first, you may feel that the shirt is too tight, but it's not. when you're carrying your hardware, it will pull down slightly and you will feel a bit more comfortable. make sure to fasten the square velcro tabs securely when you holster, and your gun will not fall out. i have used this shirt with a 15-rnd. gen 2 g22 with two 15 rnd. mags, and a smith and wesson, k-frame model 10 .38 spcl. i have never had my weapon fall out of my shirt. after several washes, it remains a secure rig. follow care instructions, and enjoy this awesome shirt. carry proudly.
58894	i bought this shirt as an alternative to your typical owb or iwb methods of carry, and to that extent it works good as a deep concealment method. when used in conjunction with the 5.11 shirts that have false buttons, it makes drawing easier than wearing a regular t shirt over this, and could function as a possible alternative method. that being said, it's made to be worn like an under armor-type shirt, tight to the body. i typically wear a large shirt but bought this in medium and it fits well. i use this as a work out shirt and stick my wallet/phone and occasionally a glock 26 in there. i can fit a 19 in there as well, but i doubt my 17 would fit in there without ripping the shirt in half, haha..the only downside is that it can get itchy along the sides, maybe if the threads were cut closer or something, but overall it works. it's a good compromise of concealment and ease of access to your firearm.
58929	i am a size 10 and a 38 c. this little dress fit great. i've read that the halter was a little long but on me it was perfect. it hangs low as it's suppose to.  and for your significant other it makes it easy for them to pull down the dress and see the goodies. the lace is very soft. the panties they should have just thrown out. but who needs panties when you put this on? lol i ordered in a black and red both are very sexy. i'd have to give this a two thumbs up as both of us love it...lol
58935	as described and fit well. this is a great addition to the bedroom spice up your life set. not trashy but very sexy.
58981	wear this shirt right out of the box.  any creases melt away.  while i would agree that cotton may be comfortable but it looks like trash half way through the day.  if you travel for business or you have an infrequent need for a shirt out of the closet to look freshly pressed, then these are very good for that.  the fit is true.  the only aspect which could be made better would be to add some stretch or spandex into the shirt for an even more fitted look.
59011	i just received these and i'm really pleased. they are well constructed and should last a while. i did buy up one size and am glad that i did. they do run a bit small. my only complaint is that they are small in the calf area. i would like to have a bit more room, but i can live with that. good purchase overall.
59026	love these boots.  usually wear an 8 or 8.5 and bought the 9.  they fit perfectly.  thanks to the reviewers who suggested going up a 1/2 size.  the plum color is very dark...almost black looking.  i am finding that the color is very rich and looks great with my skinny jeans.  this material is much lighter than the standard rubber rain boot.  they do make my feet sweat if i wear them all day.  bought another pair for my daughter.  she wears a 7.5 and i bought her an 8.  would buy again.
59034	i bought these boots having a feeling that i would have problems with them but i thought i would take a chance anyways. i am 5'3 and wear a size 7 1/2 but ordered an 8 because i am overweight, wearing a size 16 pants. the moment i saw these boots when they arrived i knew they would be snug because they looked very thin on the top opening. sure enough i struggled to try & get my foot inside. once i got my foot in the boot was very very tight on my calf & the foot itself was small. these boots i believe were only made for those women who are slim. they should make these boots wider at the opening & perhaps offer wider sizes for those of us who aren't so average.
59051	this is my second pair of kamik's. i also have some snow boots which i love. these rain boots are no different. they look and feel great. haven't tried them out in the rain yet since i hasn't rained but i am sure they will hold up. i am a 9 1/2 shoe size and a 10 fits just right, but there is no extra room. i love the red color and i got them on sale for $27 here on amazon!
59062	i just love it!!!! true to size. it has a little shine (like sparkes) that i adore. good finish
59101	these feel like slippery, thick-material granny panties.  they fit, but they just don't fit if that makes sense.  there aren't bulges or bagginess, nor do they pinch at the leg openings or waist, but they still feel somewhat like a wetsuit.  they just feel odd.  i'm sure that clingy clothes would work with these, but i don't like undergarments that i can feel all day.
59182	husband likes them!  he loved the champion socks but the quality of the manufacturing went downhill and they didn't stand up like the socks of yesteryear!  so, we had to find something different.  i found these and he gave them a try.  they hold up (so far) from multiple washings and being worn daily in heavy, steel-toe boots.  they are cushioned in the correct places and don't seem to show signs of wear at the toe or heal...not yet.
59215	my first purchase of clothing online; happy that it has been a positive experience.this pair of jeans fits well, comfortable across the body and looks smart. so why one star less ? the color is different from what i saw on my laptop screen.so now i am looking for other colors !
59230	i chose to rate the jeans as excellent because they fit.  i try to always buy wrangler brand jeans because they fit well, and last very well.
59252	"this is my second waveceptor.  the watchband broke on the first one after two and a half years, and the replacement band was priced to where it was nearly as cost effective to buy a new one.  the watch can display dual times.  being deployed, it's convenient to track my ""home"" time, as well as the time at my current location.  i have a $700 watch, but i typically wear this one because it's more versatile."
59401	i bought this ring for my wife and she just loved it! the gold looks fine and of very high quality. made to be a perfect fit. only thing i thought was, well not good but not bad was the width. it's thin, like thin, thin but it will still turn heads and very noticeable on your wife's hand so yeah. besides that the ring is excellent, of very high quality and just what your wallet is more than happy to buy hahaha! highly recommended
59411	i ordered this as a wedding band after we had been married a year. after paying for our expensive wedding we didn't have enough for a band so i used cheap costume jewelry ring for the ceremony. well that turned green quickly. i replaced it with this ring and it looks great 6 months later! the white gold matches my engagement ring perfectly. i am very satisfied and nobody could tell it was bought online. i searched around to find the best band for the money and this was it!update: 8/22/13this ring is starting to yellow. next to my white gold engagement ring you can really tell the difference. i'm very disappointed and had to change the star rating.
59427	excellent hat that shades your face and neck. great price. i also have a tan one, and both are of excellent quality and fit great.
59454	i thought this would be all i needed to care for my boots, but really i needed less.  i really only use the big brush since i prefer to use the dr. martins wonder balsam and not polish.  i want my boots to have character from use and so i want to protect them and that's it.
59463	i used this shoe horn after back surgery.  it allowed me to put on shoes without having to bend down too much.  it is light weight as it made out of plastic. i was able to use this shoe horn at rehabilitation facility and easily take with me to the doctor's appointments where i had to take shoes off and on without having to ask for help.  i have a heavy duty metal shoe horn at home, but i preferred this one for its lightness.
59528	it's so comfortable and warm. i wear it lounging about my house. if done correctly, could be real cute for an outfit!
59534	usually i am a perfect fit in the size that i ordered. the cups on this were too big. the 2 layers of material on the cups were not smooth. i was surprised, because bali used to be a good fit for me when i was smaller busted. wacoal really works for me, but it costs so much more. i did not experience support, and it sure made my figure look worse than with no bra at all.  the material itself is very comfortable. maybe bali works better for smaller bosoms. i will need to return this. it did take rather a long time for delivery, too, but arrived on the last day of the span of days for estimated arrival.
59539	this bra fits more like a slumber bra so it is comfortable.  although double lined, nipples still show through.  support is minimal and a padded bra would be recommended if you don't want visible nipples.
59556	i reviewed a lot of shoe horn-type devices before selecting this one. i have trouble kneeling down and some tightly fitting loafers that i are difficult to get onto my feet without untying.  this well-made shoe horn is long enough that i do not need to bend and getting into the shoes is a breeze. worth every penny it costs.  i highly recommend it.
59582	the sterling silver turquoise gemstone coral oblong band is wonderful! stylish, eye catching,.....different. exactly what i was looking for.
59589	"i ordered these pants in medium size and i am a bit disappointed with the fitting. the legs are very tight and the waist slightly large. the end result is that the crotch level is about 3-5"" below my actual crotch... makes me feel like i am not wearing it properly and that i may lose my pants if i was going hiking with them.warmth wise, they are doing an excellent work.the fitting may be getting better with the use but so far, not so good..."
59609	"i put a bag of candy in it and the dye from the m&ms; leaked through two layers of the cloth to stain the outside of the bag. the string that holds the bag together started to unravel around the zipper and on the straps. i got caught in a downpour and every single thing in the bag was soaked. this was only after two days of use in nyc.  potato sacks are more durable. i was disappointed in this item, so i did some research.rothco only makes costume quality products. in other words, it is for looks and not for practical use.  the little boy in the show ""once upon a time"" uses the green version of this bag in the show.  there is your proof.google ""virginia pilot rothco military lawsuit.""  this article is about a bulk order the u.s. military made through a private company.  the boots they ordered were costume quality, like everything else rothco makes, and it not actually useful."
59655	i received the sorel slipper this week.  i cannot give it a 5 star as the material in the upper part of the slipper is extremely hard and it is snug through the width.  it is made in china so that is a negative.  the quality isn't there but still the price is high.  i will have to try and break the slipper in.  i bought it because of the reviews that i read, but i certainly don't agree with a lot of the reviews that are stated.  maybe they received a softer top but the pair i received will take some doing to break them in.  if you decide to buy think long and hard.
59677	they sew a tag into the heel and it's uncomfortable. i'm surprised so many people love this slipper. they just sit in my closet and i almost always take something else instead of these.
59682	i love to shop at amazon more exclusive and if something happens or i get something wrong amazon has always made &#8203;&#8203;responsible and better; acquires another company uses amazon are excellent, amazon is always an excellent product.these rockporte zandalias, for example, i love the shape, the comfort of the beautiful in all that i can even give gende and love and is also bought through amazon, as well as any product i buy, is really cute. i love these rockport slippers are really comfortable and beautiful ...
59708	i wear a woman's 9 wide, and i have plantar fasciitis.  it's really hard to find supportive slippers in that size, so i took a chance and ordered these in a mens size 8, after reading other reviews that they tend to run small (otherwise i would have tried a size 7).  from the first moment of wearing these, i have been so pleased.  they fit like a glove and are very warm, and they support my foot bed so much better than any other slippers i've tried.  i wear them nonstop when i'm home. when the weather gets warmer, i'm going to be looking for more sorel slippers, without the warm lining.
59860	"i'm busty (30ddd or 32dd) and i usually have to buy sports bras that are unattractive and difficult to clean. this bra not only makes me look like a normal person, it is also machine washable. you can even put it in the dryer! an added benefit is the fact that the straps are adjusted in the front with velcro. you can detach the velcro in the front and flip down the ""cups"" for easy relaxation lol"
59914	that's why i gave them 4 instead of 5. i have 3 other pairs of dawgs, different styles than these,  and they are really cushy and comfortable, but these are a bit harder. i'm using these as slippers.
59919	"i was given a pair of dawg sandals as a gift.  they were a size 9... which is what i wear... and they fit great.  so i ordered this style in the same size.  when they arrived i was very disappointed because they were at least 1/2"" too short.then i had to pay almost $8.00 to return them!!why does a company that only sells their shoes online... so there is no way to try them on... not provide free return shipping?with so many companies offering free shipping for just about anything... dawgs usa really needs to reconsider this business decision.i would have tried the next size up... but knowing that i may have to pay another $8.00 to return them if they are too big... i decided against re-ordering.also... the ones i received as a gift were 'canada dawgs' and were very soft and comfy. these were 'usa dawgs' and they were not nearly as soft.  not sure if this makes a difference or not."
59938	bought 2 pair for a 16 day trip overseas and never even took them. didn't fit right (crept up, which i hate!)and i suppose that they would have dried quickly but i found my regular $5 bali panties dried out by morning. definitely not work $18 a piece. not sure what i will do with them now.
60099	these shoes are so light you don't feel them on you but they also deteriorate so fast you may think they are made of paper.
60198	i bought this to use while working out or when in uniform and does exactly what it was made to do; tell time.  the glow in the dark comes in handy and it could take a beating so if you don't want to mess up your g-shock get this.
60200	they are a little scary when they are new because they are hard to get into but after they are broken in they are very comfortable. i was slightly disapointed with the second pair i purchased because of the quality of the leather. the first pair was a smooth high quailty leather but the second pair looked like pig skin. pretty much the appearence of a foot ball.
60201	after two years of only wearing them saturdays and sundays, the boot ripped away from the sole for about an inch and a half. no way to fix it. no room for stitches at a cobbler. can't throw them away--they're too expensive. and they are seriously comfortable. (they're wider than most shoes.)two, and one-half, months later, a large chunk of the rubber sole right at the toe-end of the shoe ripped out. (???) i managed to super glue the boot back to the sole the way it, evidently, was held on in the first place. doesn't look very nice and i don't expect it to last. i also super glued the chunk of rubber back in place. i read somewhere that they're now made in china. what a tragedy.
60234	i actually liked this alot, until i actually went to the bradley store and saw it half the price on here.  so i am very dissapointed in this but, keeping it.
60254	"i own several styles of kangol's and wish there were more reviews on them. it's tough to know how they're going to fit ahead of time since you usually can't go to the mall and try all the styles on. i got my tropic player in grey - which is a more of a lighter grey color than a charcoal, in size large. i'm normally a 7 3/8 in new era baseball caps for reference.first off, this is a sweet-looking hat. i fell in love with it instantly. it just looks so cool in person. i found it to be quite structured given the rather breathable material. it's not really floppy like you might expect with 75% polyester. i would not want to pack it flat on a trip. i suppose you could fold it on its side and flatten it - i think it would retain its shape but you might risk long-term damage.the brim looks much better folded up, or at least partially-folded up, like a fedora. i wouldn't wear it as a bucket hat. and if you wore as a bucket, there would not be much sun coverage since the brim is quite short. really this hat is just for fashion purposes only - there's no real usefulness to it.the hat has a higher top/ more head space/ than other kangol's i have. so if you had a taller head, this hat would fit great. it does have a nice roomy fit in the crown area. the one minor complaint is that it might be a little too tall/ too roomy up top. my unofficial measurements have it at 4"" from the bottom to the crease part; it's about a 5"" rise from the bottom to the upper side-lips. but it does gather rave reviews, glances, comments from random strangers.overall, it's an awesome hipster/ musician/ all-around-cool hat. it quickly became one of my favorites. i think it's a little pricey though, as i'd love to own it in more colors/patterns. overall though, an uber-cool kangol"
60270	i bought these hoping they would take place of my old hp's but, the size was wrong. the shoes said 10w and they fit more like 10 regular. however, the size did fit someone else, who needed a pair so, no more getting shoes before trying them on first, bummer.
60294	these are so comfortable. i have been able to wear them all day with no issues with my feet and they are adorable shoes. would highly recommend.
60308	this is a fun gift for a bride-to-be.  it also works great as a costume piece.  i went as a zombie bride for halloween and got this as an accessory.  really great if you're going to be walking around past sun down.  lite up great.
60333	this is the crocs i have been waiting for.  it looks like a sandal but feels like the crocs i have loved (but were not that good looking).  i have one in black and one in brown.  they go with everything!
60362	i am a big fan of crocs but this style, although good looking, fits much larger than size.  i could have exchanged for a whole size smaller and still be roomy.  i own three other styles of crocs which are true to size.
60421	this is my third watch of this design. it is very comfortable and looks good with both gold and silver jewelry. only problem is that i do have to take it to a jewelers to have the battery changed.
60430	i bought this thinking about the daily update to a nuclear clock and solar power to have a watch last longer than four years. this one lasted about four months before it stopped working altogether. i wouldn't buy this watch again.
60443	"whoever invented the g watches was a genius! tough as tough can get, i got it everywhere in every vacation on all the continents. accurate time to the boot. nice time keeping features/chronometer/alarms and the part i like most: the excellent gimmick called ""tough solar"" that keeps ticking the watch for me with occasional exposure to light for 5+ years (i particularly love this feature as in the past i had watches going belly up from water immersion after battery changes). totally love it and would buy casio gs over and over again! (incidentally does a much better job than any rollex apart from brushing insecure egos, i guess;)"
60463	very heavy on the wrist, and sooooo not waterproof. is ok for splashes, but not swimming or showering, so it's really only a matter of time before i forget and doom this watch to a watery grave. however, it is stylish, and the face has high contrast and is legible. however , the lack of water resistance to normal activities ( i'm in healthcare and wash my hands a lot...so with no water resistance this watch will be doomed) gives it a low rating. get a waterproof watch instead.
60483	this is thinner than i thought it would be. yet it does keep me warm when worn under a sweater and jacket in 30+ degree weather with light winds. i am one of those people usually cold when others are comfortable.
60560	if you wear two bras to exercise this one bra is for you. it really is two bras. inside are full coverage low cut inner molded cups with underwire that hold your gals up. outside the generous all over exterior compression keeps them in place. thick straps are inset, adjustable, and will not fall down. the wide chest band stays in place. be sure to get the right size though, the fit is critical to comfort. i have been wearing this bra (numerous purchases, thank you) for at least 5 years. they hold up well with gentle machine washing and line drying. you enjoy separation inside but the compression outside gives a bit of a &#34;uni-boob&#34; look. this is just fine for exercise/casual wear or shirtless. great coverage. especially good for anyone who wears a large cup size and/or wants lots of support. the photo is an accurate representation of how the bra will look on a full-figure.
60562	i've really enjoyed my moving comfort bras (i mostly have junos). it was time for me to try a smaller size so i gave this one a try as it was on sale. this bra is nearly perfect--which makes it all the more frusterating i can't wear it.it has fantastic support for my size (34c), doesn't give me the dreaded uniboob, and--despite the underwire--the structure is comfortable. it is not a bra you can wear with anything other than a crew neck, though, as it comes up pretty high. if you are very active and don't need to wear anything low-cut, it's totally worth the trade-off for the support.sadly, either the shiny nylon material they chose as a shell over the top or the stitching over the padding inside (which makes contact with the top of my chest) itches terribly to the point it actually hurts. i have latex sensitivities so that may be the connection. definitely not recommended for women with sensitive skin or allergies. such a shame as i have not had this problem with other moving comfort bras, and this one is otherwise awesome.
60602	great shirt for when it starts to get cool. i'm an in between  size, so mediums are usually too small and larges are just a tiny bit big. i go with large to allow shrinking. this guy in large was way too big. not a huge deal just reordered a medium and this can be a pajama shirt
60625	did not provide any additional heat and was uncomfortable to wear.  i was very disappointed and returned the shirt.  i used the package, the mailing label and then the manufacture claims they never got it back.  so i would never purchase from them again.  zero communications over the shipping issue.
60638	quality long sleeve shirt at a great price. i've washed it many times, and it's good as new. however, i hang dry it...not in the dryer. no shrinkage that way. i really like the open sleeves around my wrists. i highly recommend this shirt.
60654	these sandals are perfect for summer for my daughter and i know my other daughter will get use out if them as well since they last forever. i bought a size down though since that is what was recommended.
60712	i bought a pair of these boots last year, and loved them so much that i bought another pair in a different color this year. they fit great and are super comfortable. i can wear them all day at work without having my feet hurt. highly recommend aerosoles brand.
60713	update: i bought another pair this year in brown for 49$ on overstock. i love how comfortable and warm these shoes have been during the winters. another thing i like about them is how easy it is to slip my feet in and out of these shoes. i still use the lovely black one i bought two years ago.--------------i got them on piperlime during last thanksgiving sale after lot of research on the internet. i do yoga, so wearing even a inch of heel makes my calf muscles very stiff and painful. so i was basically looking for a flat boot.this shoe has lot of room inside and does not make me feel claustrophobic. comfort is a great factor for me while buying boots and i hate tight fitting shoes which bite. i am a size 7 and i went for a size 7.5 like i do with all my shoes. i can also wear it comfortably with a pair of wool socks. i have never felt uncomfortable in these even though i have worn them for long stretches of time.it looks very stylish with the old fashioned brass buckles and the side zipper and it does not take a lot of effort to wear and remove the show from the feet. it goes well with my long wool coat, short coat and i can even wear it over my skinny jeans. it goes well on dresses in fall and spring. i have received numerous compliments on this boot. i have a broad calf and the shoe does not feel tight around it.of course it is not real leather, but has the look and feel of real leather. i am a vegetarian, so all the more great for me. after wearing it for a year now, it still looks very new. i just wipe it with a wet cloth if it is muddy.over all a great buy for me.
60732	"i was very disappointed when i discovered the boots went further up the knee, so as to be uncomfortable!  i am 5'1"" and so i was surprised that i would be unable to enjoy these beautiful boots.  sadly, they had to go back."
60736	i haven't worn pettipants since i was a teenager, didn't know that they were still around till i saw them on amazon.  they are not elegant lingerie, but they are good enough. keep my legs from chafing, help keep me warm in winter - perhaps will keep me cool in summer.  i really don't like pantyhose, so if i can get away with wearing a long skirt, pettipants, socks and boots, i am quite happy. i do not find these smooth enough to wear under trousers - a bump shows where they stop. i also purchased them 2 sizes smaller than the size chart indicated. these fit fine.  i also purchased nylon pettipants through amazon, and find them more comfortable.
60741	this is very reasonably priced and prevents the rubbing together of the upper thighs when wearing a dress. i would buy this item again
60778	"it arrives very smelly from the rubber belt, which is why i subtracted a star. the wig is cheaply made, but it works and the dress is nice (not super sheer like another reviewer stated). i don't think it's cut all that small. i read other reviews that said the small was too small. i'm 5'3"" and about 111 lbs and the medium has room. it's not so big that i will return it, but i think i could have gone with the small after all. however, the tag says size 6-10 and there's no way someone that is size 10 could fit in this dress. the length is good, but the sleeves are super long. i'm definitely going to wash it and try to get that smell out. happy halloween!"
60805	these lightweight sunglasses are the third pair that i have purchased.  i wear them for riding my bike.  they are great sun glasses for a fraction of the cost of my oakley's.  my other two pairs sit in the car and my golf bag.
60847	these shoes look great have good support, but the wide wasn't wide enough - unfortunately it was quite constricting  - as narrow as regular width shoes i found. and they charged me for shipping to return. learned my lesson - zappos is the place for shoes.
60872	i helped plan a princess birthday party for my neice and she loved this.  she loves princesses but is more the self-saving princess type so the cowboy let her show off her more rough-and-tumble style.  very fun costume piece.  it's child sized but fit me as well.  would probably be ok for adults with small heads.
60951	i have purchased this under wired bra a number of times.  i like the fit, comfort, and smooth lines it gives me under my shirts and tops.  it maintains it's shape with minimal care and the elastic has lasted well.  the only problems i've had is, after a long time, the wire worked it's way through on one bra, but it had seen much wear and many machine washes by then.  it is an easy repair with a few stitches.  i'm very satisfied with these bras and have them in a number of colors.  recommend!
60954	this cami looks great, and is really silk soft, but it is rather short (i got a medium), and it doesn't stay in place.  i'm constantly having to rearrange it while i'm wearing it.  it's just okay.
60955	since i bought this to use as a sleep top, it wasn't really what i'd hoped for.  it's tight fitting in the midsection.  (i bought a large to be comfortable, but it's too snug to sleep in)  as a layer under a sweater or top it will be fine.
60962	very comfortable - simple but comfortable.  now why they want more words for this is unbelievable.  sometimes more is just ridiculous.
60975	no complaints at all.very pretty ring, the stone actually looks better in person. i really cant emphasize enough at least on the one they sent me how much prettier the stone is than it looks online.i think the size runs a wee bit small.the only reason i didn't give it five stars is that the silver/metal is in the thin side and not as high quality as most of these types of rings are. still, great value and i will shop at this vendor again.
61013	i mounted this earring holder inside my closet above my jewelry armoire.  i had so many pairs of earring that were mixed up and  miss-matched in my jewelry box.  it did take a little bit of time and patience to sort them out and determine where to hang them on the holder.  but, now it is so easy to select a pair to wear and just as easy to replace them on the holder at the end of the day.  i love this product!
61019	they snag, the strips don't line up, they look like a printer test sheet. they falls down my legs, and after wearing them once they were so stretched that they don't even look like socks anymore. not to mention they aren't even shaped like socks to begin with, they are tubes of striped tights that didn't get finished.
61036	to me it seemed a bit to small. i put my black glasses in it, but was afraid to keep them in it. i have another case i use. the glasses come with a black bag that is good to put them in. i wish they had sent me a case a little bit larger. i love the oakly black glasses though. i want to protect them.
61053	"i have looked high and low for pants that1.  don't go up to my ribcage with an ""elastic waistband leaving it's judgmental pink teeth marks around my thanksgiving belly"" as marshal from himym says in season 4's ep. the front porch.these hit just the right place, and aren't too low either, because that is just as bad.  and the back of them doesn't leave my crack showing when i bend over.  a girl likes a bit of coverage back there.2.  the material is just right too.  i had 100% cotton ones from target before, and they would fit fine right out of the dryer, but by a couple of hours, they would stretch out and bag, and be too loose.  these have just enough stretch, without being made of that horrid work out material that i can't stand to touch with my hands.3.  aren't high waters, and don't bunch up under my feet unless i'm wearing 4 inch heels.  these perfectly skim the floor in my bare feet.i didn't order two sizes larger as it suggested, i'm usually a med in pants (5'8"" and 134 lbs), and the lg is just right.  i'm glad the other reviews steered me to just order one size up."
61076	the gold on black design is classic styling that is accentuated by the ceramic finish that further sets it apart.  even my wife thinks it's a striking watch.  the ceramic finish is very light and not nearly as thick or heavy as i anticipated, so the band thickness is not much more than the standard steel band.  i'll be removing a link to adjust for my wrist size.  i'm 6' - 295lbs, so i was surprised at having to remove a link.  i'm not big on watch batteries, therefore the kinetic movement was a big plus.  picked this up on sale for less than half of the msrp $475 and i am very happy with this purchase.  i just wish that the bezel rotated instead of being fixed.
61077	seiko men's ska366 kinetic black ion watchi've owned this watch for about 2 years and rotate it with other watches that i wear.  it is a solidly built watch and keeps very good time.  the watch itself has a black dial with a gold bezel and bars for numbers and the hands glow in the dark as do the positions where the number would be.  the band is metal and has a clasp that stays locked when wearing and requires you to pinch the clasp when you want to remove the watch from your wrist.  there is a date window at the 4 o'clock position.i'm not a person who requires a watch that needs to have the precise time each day, but the watch comes as close to it as possible, it loses about one-half second per day.  the watch is kinetic, which means that the movement of your wrist back and forth will wind the watch as there is a weighted mechanism that coverts kinetic energy into electrical energy to run the quartz movement.  the watch fits nicely on the wrist, not too big that it ruins your shirt sleeve on your shirt, and fits comfortably on your wrist.  this seiko is not very heavy either which can be a problem.  you won't get this watch caught or bumped when you work around your desk either as it conforms to fit just right on your wrist.i clean the watch when i take it off, as i run into problems with the stems on watches as they corrode and disintegrate.  this watch has held up remarkably well and there is not a green spot or band around your wrist when you take it off.  for a watch that keeps good time, looks super, wears well and doesn't cost an arm and a leg to purchase, this is a great gift and will be appreciated by the wearer.for two years this watch has held up very well, where other more expensive watches have fallen apart, this watch keeps going.  it is a very handsome watch as well, a good choice for work or a formal situation.  most watches fail me, this watch is well constructed, as it keeps me on time.
61086	this is a lovely watch, very stylish and light weight.  the rectangular face of the watch is elegant with the roman numerals. it definitely has the look of a much more expensive watch.  the leather band is not quite as soft as i would prefer, which is why i give it four stars, but it looks very nice and has enough holes to accommodate my very small wrist.  you can't beat the price for such an elegant look!
61094	a passport holder plus credit card holders. i wasn't expecting much for something less than $10. but i didn't want to put my passport by itself whiling renewing it so i bought this to give it a cover. the leather quality is very good. i think it is as good as premium leather jacket. it fits right in yet very easy for quick removal. but i don't think anybody need to take it out of the cover in the air port.i love this extra credit card pockets. it allow me to keep my ssn and other emergency credit card in there.
61104	i bought this passport cover to replace one that i had for several years. it has fewer card slots than i would have liked. my previous passport holder had slots on both sides. however the fewer slots keeps me from overstuffing it. i live and work overseas and need to carry my passport with me at all times. i almost always keep my passport holder in my front pant pocket. thus it gets a lot of wear. so far after several months of use this passport holder has held up extremely well with no signs of wear.
61107	could have been better but for price there is no complaints bought it for my mum and she likes it very much
61132	i normally wear and 11-11/2 and i ordered these in 12. lengthwise they were fine but they were a bit narrow. also, they just didn't seem like they would be very comfortable. there just didn't feel like there was much padding in them. the quality seemed ok but as i took them out of the box, tried them on and put them right back in the box i can really attest to durability. they were nice looking.returned them.
61177	simple and elegant. the size is just right, the sapphire hearts are lovely and clear. the setting is very solid and well made. it's a n excellent piece of jewelry
61196	high arch, very stable shoe and very warm.  my next pair (i am already considering) will be  size smaller and i will make sure to watch for women's vs unisex.  but all in all a great shoe and i am very happy with the pair.
61213	these are very soft and comfortable. i ordered a size larger than i probably should have... these likely would have fit perfectly if i'd gone with my normal size.
61279	finding the right size panties is rough b/c i'm a man and i have more to work with down there in order to get the panties to fit right so i ordered it in a size 7 and it felt absolutely perfect as i was so lucky to discover these panties and their so silky and comfortable they feel real light on me. it feels like a dream to wear to these as i'm wearing the black ones with my black silky nightgown that i ordered from vanity fair and i haven't taken either garment off in the past two days that's how comfortable they are. if you're a man like me who likes to wear nightgowns then these are the perfect panties for you and a size 6, 7, or even 8 is the way to go if you're over 6 feet tall like i am and weigh around 200 lbs.
61299	the hair falls out of this item and is very messy...not of good quality! also, it does not breathe well so, if you sweat easily beware it can be very, very uncomfortable. also, remember...it can scare little kids.in addition, it took quite a few weeks to receive a refund and we had to pay for return shipping which was a bummer. we do not recommend.
61347	had to pass onto a friend, he looked like the incredible hulk in his words, we bought the 6/7 and they fit my three year old, my tall three year old who wears a size 5.
61390	i have never felt comfortable carring a purse, they are always to big, to small, to long or to short.  i don't mind carring a backpack but sometimes they are just not practical.  this bag is the best of both worlds.  it is not a backpack so a little more upscale and yet it can be tossed over your shoulder and has the ease of one.tons of space and great compartments inside and out for keeping things organized.i purcased the medium size as i intended to use it when i went on vacation.  this bag fit all my needs.  easy to carry and not bulky.  it could be worn over my shoulder or extend the strap and i was able to sling it across so the zipper rested in front for those crowded areas were pick pockets are plentiful.i was able to carry: larger wallet, small digital camera, 1 guide book, 1 paperback novel, 2 glass cases, a water bottle, gloves, a small umbrella and a shawl for when it got cold on the way home.  all this and it did not seem heavy, clumsy or bulky...amazing...there was even space left over...amazing....and it wasn't like lugging around a sack...amazing.  like my trusty backpack and yet so much nicer to carry around and absolutley no back or shoulder pain.an added bonus, no one gave me the stink eye when i went into shops to browse as often happens if you carry a backpack.  i wish i had found this years ago.
61401	this was a gift for my wife. she has owned a similar ameribag for years, but it was not leather. it was some type of fabric that easily stained and impossible to clean. though she really liked it, she rarely used it as it just started to look too shabby from the stains and dirt that could not be removed.so, i got her this leather one, and she is ecstatic! quality is excellent and she loves the color. lots of handy pockets and compartments and plenty of room.like the title says; she's happy, i'm happy!
61421	the first time i opened the umbrella it pinched my finger. was ok after that but i was a little nervous! it is beautiful and my grandchildren are thrilled with the change from plain to flowers when wet.
61553	i love these hipsters. the fabric is smooth and thin but durable. they are great for everyday because they never show under my clothes. no vpl here. i'm an athlete and i do a lot of hiking, running, yoga, rafting, etc. these are my go to for every activity i do. my only wish is that i could buy a three pack of all black and not have to get the assorted colors.
61570	very nice corset....well made and great price! i do recomend if you like a little more room to order the next size bigger or the lace back will be far apart.this is a must have for jeans or suite...looks fantastic with both!thanks!dusty
61581	i almost ordered these exact slippers from footsmart for more money. the slippers arrived quickly and are very warm and comfortable.
61627	i wear this top to bed.  it is tight-fitting, does not turn or move while i asleep, stays tucked in, dries in a sec and is smooth to the touch.
61758	this costume is for a courtesan theme act of  mine and looks fabulous..fits snug..i would say true to size..i work out and do fitness stuff..so i had to order a large to fit my arms and shoulders....but my sister who is a size 2-4 normally fit right in hers...theres adjustments on the back via laces..but there is no stretch at all in the fabric..so i would say order a bit larger than what you would normally wear....they look fabulous and i have everyone asking where they can get them..
61777	this is really good quality material.  the things i didn't like about it is that there is a little too much material around the armpits and kind of rubs.  also, it goes down really far in the front and if your legs are *ahem* up, it rubs really uncomfortably on your thighs.  i would absolutely buy this brand again, but probably not this exact style.
61783	my only negative is that i wish there was more detailed instructions on how to use each tool.  i am really not very good at this stuff.  however, i did find some videos on youtube which were helpful.
61792	"these boots are exquisite.  i consider myself to be pretty fashion forward, so i bought these boots for wearing on a normal basis.  i don't have any cosutmes to wear them with, nor any weddings to attend.  i just loved the style of boot and really wanted a pair for myself.fit:- fabulous.  i wear an 8 in any heel lower than 3.5 inches, and these fit perfectly.  i also have a slightly wider foot than normal (thought i wouldn't consider it ""wide"") and i was afraid these would be narrow.  not at all!- the calf area is a little big.  i have lean, muscular legs (from living in my stilettos) so my legs are a little smaller around than most women.  these boots have room in the calf area, even when they are laced as tight as they can go.  they are still pretty form-fitting, though.  i still love them.style:- the lace goes all the way up the boot.  the boot goes up to mid calf.  then, there is this miraculous zipper on the inside of each boot that allows you to lace it up just once, then from that point forward- zip and you're done!  lovely.  and it doesnt distract from the elegance of the boot.  it all looks nicely put together.- the lace inlay is not see-through like i originally thought it was.  it is white lace over white material.  still beautiful though.- as much as i feared these boots would look a little ""witchy"" if worn with every day skirts and such, they really dont.  i even put them on with a mini skirt yesterday and some pearls, and the boots still looked fabulous.- color is slightly off-white.  i wouldn't say ivory, and i wouldn't say white.quality:- the material is a little low quality.  i'm not sure if these boots will hold up through any kind of rain, snow, etc.  but we're going to find out when i wear them as part of my shoe rotation this winter!  i'm concerned the material might start to peel after water has touched it.- the shoe feels sturdy and i'm not afraid it'll fall apart.shipping:- 5 out of 5.  each boot was in it's own sleeve of plastic, stuffed with packing to keep their shape, then boxed, wrapped in shipping plastic and labeled.  i received within 5 days after ordering."
61798	bag is nicely made but a little difficult to open. the zippers don't move very fluidly. lots of storage space but don't expect to put larger items in the side pockets. i didn't care for the type of hanger it has but it serves the purpose.
61901	i give this 4 stars because it is a great product for making larger sweaters or knits more packable. the description is spot on. you don't really need it for t-shirts or flat clothes.
61907	how did i ever travel without this before? it is such a handy thing to have for travelling. it hangs right around your neck where you need it, or tucks nicely into a purse. you can put money in the back zippered part, your passport and id, etc in the front, and you'll never go looking for your boarding pass again. it tucks right into the top and you can see it easily with the clear plastic sleeve. thumbs up for this!!!
62015	"the design of this dress is very pretty. it does run a bit large though. i'm 5'4"", 130lbs, size, 6, and the small/medium is still a little loose. from the pictures, i was not expecting the sleeves to flare out at the wrists, but they do, and they can get in the way when using your hands. overall, a good quality dress though."
62032	this was a huge surprise. i didn't expect much for the price. figured it would be something to wear once and after a wash it would fall to pieces. not so! i didn't like the the little bra and thong that came with it but i have plenty of other panties and cute bras to go along with it and cannot complain because it was priced well and made surprisingly well especially as priced. i am still shocked and pleased.
62167	"i'm a pear-shaped gal, 5'1"" and 150 lbs. i bought these dickie's women's flat front stretch twill pants in black size 12 petite. the fit is nearly perfect, just a little long but i'm quite short! the tag on the pants says ""slim fit"". they are slightly fitted in the thighs and flare out a bit on the lower leg, like the photo. i usually have big problems with the waist being too wide on pants since my waist is more of a size 8, but these were not too ""gappy"". they do ride a bit low, so watch out for plumber butt, but nearly all pants i find these days are like that.bottom line: these work for even short and curvy girls!"
62182	sized horribly. i fit a 13 from everyone else. this fits like a 10. quality is poor as well. frayed seams. loose stitches. not worth  what i paid even on a lightning deal. returning and shopping elsewhere.
62257	i have purchased several invicta time pieces from amazon over the past few years. with the exception of my invicta pro-diver automatic, this has to be the best made and appealing watch i have seen from invicta. the dial is large and meaty as shown in my photos. the numbers, hands and 12 dot all glow in the dark. this watch was priced at an attractive $49.99 with free 1 day shipping. i ordered it at 5:00pm on 11-10-08 and received it at 2:00pm on the 11th. not sure if this is an early black friday deal from amazon or a price typo; however, this watch is well worth the $49.99. i received an email from invicta. this is actually a 2009 model that is suppose to be released in march; however, amazon has it now. this is a very attractive price for this watch. based on invicta's msrp, the watch should actually be around $129.00, so the $49.99 is a steal. nice time piece for yourself and for a gift!!! this was the email i received from invicta:dear valued customerthis model is one of the next year models that are selling now.but we will not have it in our website probably until march next year.and when the watch is posted in our website it will say the same it says on amazon, because that is the info that we gave to them
62317	these are very dark tan in color.  i was hoping for more of a nude but i guess it says suntan.  this is more of a dark suntan.... think the color of someone who tans a lot.they are also a little long for me.  i  am short (5' 3&#34;) and these have to be rolled down at the top to take up some of the extra length.  not my favorite.
62374	(update: stopped working after a year..fyi)i got this jewelry cleaner in order to make liposomal vitamin c (making a fat soluble, more bio absorbable version of vitamin c with lecithin), so my comments are not regarding the jewelry cleaning ability.the idea is that the ultrasonic waves work to encapsulate the ascorbic acid crystals, running it for 30 minutes and stirring with a wooden spoon throughout the process. it must be effective because myself and everyone whose tried it has had spectacular results with the end product (liposomal c), including increased energy and mental focus (i believe it makes the components of the lecithin, choline, inositol, much more bio available too)i am giving four stars not five because i've only been using it a few weeks, so i can't attest to its longevity, and because it only runs for a few minutes at a time (please let me know if you know how to make it run longer) before you need to hit the restart button, and all that button pushing has to be wear and tear to the motor. also it is noisy as other reviewers have mentioned, but that is not such a big deal to me.i just saw this in a retail store for $49, so this is a good price too.
62378	i'm very happy with this jewelery cleaner.  it works great and the price was right.  i use it at least every week and my jewelry has never looked better.
62394	i was very disappointed in the product that was sent.  it was a cheap substitute - not even the same brand.fortunately, i had seen other reviewers talk about the bait and switch problem, so we caught the mistake right away.we contacted amazon & they said they would send us the correct machine...the one we ordered.we will be returning this cheap model tomorrow via ups.i will write an update when we get the correct machine.
62440	the only thing this machine had a bit of trouble cleaning was my aquamarine ring that hasn't been cleaned in 5 years.  that took 3 cycles to clean.  my diamond rings came out sparkly new.  my fiance used the machine to clean his darling coins and medals he acquired during his military service and was blown away by how sparkly new his coins and medals came out.i did not buy cleaning solutions.  i just used dish soap and warm water.i got this for $20 dollars.  i highly recommend it.
62460	"living in the beautiful pacific northwest, i am rained on just about daily. however, there is a difference between ""rain"" and ""vertical downpours"". so for the latter, i decided to get the best umbrella made. and that is shedrain windpro. made in portland, oregon, it does the job. no more shaky cheap umbrella. this baby is meant to last and last. it opens easily, and closes fast. i am confident that when i go out in the pouring rain, this umbrella will do its very best to keep me safe and dry."
62476	"i am 70 and my fantastic pecs from my 30's and 40' are no longer fantastic.  i've gained weight and felt they were breasts instead of pecs.  you older guys know what i mean.  i tried this compression tank.  it was a struggle the first time i put it on but have learned how to do it correctly now.  but strangely it seems to make my stomach look like i have a beer belly.  it does control the chest area pretty well but has accentuated my tummy.  it's most likely my old body telling me ""hey nobody's looking at you anyway"".  there are some pluses.  it does make you feel more firm all over.  it is nice on cold days keeping you warmer.  so if i were you i'd give it a try, as each person is built differently."
62482	my husband wanted something like this to workout in and wear to work under his clothes to keep his chest tight all day. its comfortable and it shipped quickly id say this is true to size but if you are ordering it more for compression then get one size smaller than what you are.
62519	"this purchase was for my second pair of clarion gtxs.  i bought a pair in 2006, and they've just now worn to the point where i need a new pair.  there was no question for me as the old ones faded: i had to get another pair of the same boot.my praise notwithstanding, this is definitely a pair of shoes you need to try on and really get to know before you purchase them.  i most strongly recommend that you find a retailer and try on these boots and keep them on for a good while before you decide to purchase.  now, if you want to come back to amazon.com and get them here, that's up to you.  that's what i did, having purchased my first pair way back when at rei.  i returned to rei for this latest purchase, and found they no longer carried them.  online they're available with many sellers, but i came back to amazon.com as this was where the best price was.  really.these are not soft, squishy tenny-boot hybrids where you can lope through the forest as you do your parkour or hash.  these are no-spit rigid hiking boots for off-trail, rocks, pitch, places where you need something that is going to hold up and will protect your feet while giving you good, solid, reliable contact. these are ""serious"" boots, and are engineered--and priced--accordingly.some folks have noted the fit and feel at the back of the boot.  the rise is not out of the ordinary, but the boot is rather stiff.  it is not for everyone.  this is another reason to try them on first.in six active years with this boot, not once did my feet get wet or cold.  in the cold weather they were unstoppable.  my feet did not get hot, not even in the summer.fit: these boots are a bit unique in fit.  for years i have been a very solid 12, and still buy in 12, but ended up buying these boots the first time in 11, and have had no problem at all with them.  no pain, blisters, ugly break-in period, none of that.  trying them on again for ths purchase, i noted again that 11 was the size to go with.  that isn't really to say that the boots run small.  i just strongly recommend you find a pair in a store and make sure that you are getting the right size for your feet, and what you're going to do with your feet and these boots.bottom line: i couldn't be happier with this boot, either my old pair or my new pair.  they are expensive, yeah, but are exceptionally sturdy and deliver on all claims of warmth, dryness and sturdiness.-----------------------------update, 9 december 2013:just back after a cold december camping weekend in nonstop rain, sleet, freezing rain and snow and mud, 48 hours out in very unpleasant conditions.  and not even the slightest hint of dampness in my boot, my feet warm and dry the entire time out.  my son, in his new vasques (another model) also was completely good to go all weekend long, dry and warm.  this is a great boot, and i'm a solidly loyal customer."
62554	these are exactly like those i used to buy in the mall -- not better, not worse -- in every way but price.some of these were duplicates but it didn't really matter.  these are just for everyday.  parts are going to get lost.  it's much nicer when they were roughly 50 cents for each rather than $10.  i liked getting a collection of twenty at once.  it's funny.
62603	"our buying habits have changed in the past several years. more people on a tight budget is part of the reason. brand names we have heard of for decades as being top of the line that have fallen in quality and now are riding on that once good name, is another reason.  that reason is why being able to read reviews has become a fundamental part of any purchase i make. in the past year i have had to replace my entire shoe wardrobe, and have been pleased with every ""review read"" choice i have made. but my purchase of these loafers was like cinderilla trying on the glass slipper! the moment i slipped my foot into these shoes, and then walked in them, i knew i had a whole another level of quality and comfort. they are a dream to wear. the size is dead bang on target...the look of the shoe screams ""i am quality, baby""! i was so thrilled with this gem of a find that i ordered three more pair of loafers in different colors and styles, and i will purchase more as spring an summer approach. the majority of the reviews i read convinced me the quality i was looking for i would find with bass, and they were right. there were some reviews that complained, saying bass was not what it once was. to them i reply, ""if bass was better than it is now, wearing them must have been an out of body experience""....i truly can not imagine how they could possibly be more fantastic then they are now. my ordered arrived in the morning before i had dressed for the day. i put them on and kept them on. my sister's comment was if i loved the way they looked and felt now, just imagine how great they'll look when i'm wearing something other than pajamas! you will really be happy with this purchase...more so than you'd expect! enjoy!"
62630	i had to get a collared shirt for work asap and this was the one i bought. i am not a normal xl shirt wearer but i thought i'd rather have a shirt that was too big than small. unfortunately with little time to spare i absolutely had to return this it was blatantly too small around the bust area and pulled.
62657	after purchasing a pair of mens for myself, my mom had to have these. the slippers have memory foam insoles, and a lot of lining in them to keep your feet warm and cozy during the winter. i found that both pairs don't make out feet sweat, but keeps them warm enough where no heat gets out of the slipper. the first time you wear them, some of the loose lining may come up, but once they are broken in, this goes away. they are the most comfortable brand of slipper we have ever owned. i would recommend ordering the closest size up if your unsure. they are tight and snug on your feet, but not too tight where your feet are strangled and constricted. my shoe size was a 12/13 so i ordered a 13 in mens and it fits perfectly snug. my mom was a 8/9, and the 9 is perfect on her foot. any size less would have been too tight. if your between sizes, i recommend going to the upper.overall, warmest slipper i have ever had, most comfortable, and this one is well worth &lt; $20 on amazon with prime. stores sell similar shoes for $30 or more.
62695	great quality belt but be careful about what size you get....i wear a large in shirts and pants and have about a 37 inch waist...i ordered a large belt and it was way too long, but i kept it to use for a different purpose and ordered a second one in medium which is still on its way to me.....i have no doubt that the medium will fit me, so just be careful...i dont remember them having a sizing chart for belts, so i didnt know which size would really fit me....i made the wrong decision on the large one, but i found a use for it and just kept it.
62701	"i've been a g-shock fan for a while, but after buying this watch, i am seriously rethinking my loyalties. for the same price or cheaper than an entry-level g-shock, the ironman shock gets you the same basic functionality (stopwatch, countdown timer, light, alarms, 200m wr) and then some (30-lap memory, improved band design, superior legibility, user-friendly guided settings).let's break those improvements down a bit:-the ironman shock has a 30-lap memory with its stopwatch, so you can time and review your laps or intervals rather than just your whole run/swim/bike. want to know if you took that hill faster than you usually do? the ironman shock will tell you, a standard g-shock will not.-the band includes a notch for the keeper to rest in, so the keeper will not slide around but will do its job and hold the extra strap in place.-unlike g-shocks, there is no excess visual flair (like redundant seconds counters) taking up space on the dial. the digits are large and legible, easy to read at a glance or from an angle.-with a g-shock, you either have to constantly refer to the user manual, use trial and error, or simply memorize the correct buttons to push in order to change the settings. the ironman shock guides you through any settings changes with blinking ""next,"" ""done,"" ""+"" and ""-"" markers to indicate which buttons you should push to do what. no more guesswork!in addition, the ironman shock is a more convenient size than most g-shocks. it's comparable in size to the dw5600 and significantly smaller than most of the other g-shock models so you can actually wear it with long sleeves or a coat in winter.no, the watch isn't solar-powered. it won't do your homework for you, either, even if you ask it very politely. but it's the best bang-for-your-buck sport watch out there. casio would do well to learn from the user-friendly features that this watch packs, or the g-shock may soon find itself dethroned.p.s. i got my ironman shock for $35 from wally world. good luck finding a g-shock that cheap."
62703	i may have been sent one that made it past quality control.. i am an avid fan of timex, but this one let me down.  within a workweek, two of the four decorative screws on the bezel fell off and the indiglo function began to work only when it felt like it. for the price you may be better off with an entry level g shock..being a timex guy that's a pain to type.  on the plus side it looked good and was comfy. hence i don't mind having to give it one star.  it has been returned to amazon and exchanged for the casio dw5600-e1.
62706	i can't believe that this is not a g shock!  it is a complete g shock homeage.  it feels like a g shock on my wrist.  but it is much more legible then a g, and i can count my laps with it in the pool.  i got it from wally world for $35.  yeah, a g shock might last longer, might have a mineral crystal instead of a plastic one, might look better longer.  whatever.  i will wear this non g with pride, and i will be able to count my laps.  i wish that it would record more laps than 30, but it can count up to a hundred, and i only do 70-80.  i like the resin face plate.  200 m water resistant means i can push the buttons all that i want under water.  i always wanted the casio 3 eyed monster, but i hated all of the wasted real estate.  this way i get a similar-styled watch without the 3 useless eyes. i will still wear my dw5600, but i see this watch getting more wrist time for a while.  the illumination only lights up the numbers, which is kind of a bummer, but i can still see the watch at night.  the flip-light night mode doesn't work, big deal.  band is a little stiff (kind of like g shocks) but it will loosen up after some more laps in the pool.  i still have to give it five stars for its price, legibility and added functionality over the casios.  i will wear it until it dies and then probably buy another one.  timex watches usually look more beat up quicker than g shocks, but this one is black, so it might work out.
62753	i bought these because my last boots began to leak early on in winter.i live in st. petersburg, russia so i needed boots that could handle cold and wet. with my old boots i could hardly ride a bus in the winter without feeling like my feet would freeze and fall off.these are amazing! when i first wore them they were a bit snug and the lining rubbed the inside of my foot. they became more fitted to my foot in a few days and i realized i hadn't pulled them tightly enough so that was fixed as well. since then i have had no complaints!on new year's eve i stood outside in the freezing cold for an hour without moving and my feet were perfectly warm. i did not think this was possible!they are much lighter than they look as well. the pull cord does get a bit ragged since it is suede but i don't mind that.i would recommend these boots to anyone! they are pretty and very warm and very comfortable. i wore them sightseeing this winter where i was on my feet all day in them and they were very comfy!love!update: i have had them for the second winter now and they are still wonderful and in perfect condition!
62772	the wig is a cheap wig, but for a cheap wig it looks very good. looks almost real. very effective for a costume.
62809	the tux can in very quickly - luckily because i ordered it a week before prom. son had two proms to go to and i got off cheaper buying this than renting a tux once and i needed to rent twice. had shoes and shirt already - only thing i had to buy was matching ties. polyester and not wool so it was not to heavy to wear in the summer in southern louisiana - son loved the tux. it looked great both at his prom and ex-girlfriend's pretentious catholic school's prom. no one noticed that is was not an expensive one or a rental. will definitely go here for younger son's future proms.
62866	it definitely holds up very well.not much to say, i mean it's a horsehair brush that applies polish to a shoe, etc. and it does its job quite nicely.
62870	i thought this brush did a great job of applying the polish and restoring my shoes to their former glory.
62895	i bought this for devil's costume to attend a new year's eve masquerade ball. for the price, i was very pleased with the dress. i'm 5'9&#34;, and the dress trails on the floor without shoes. i will definitely be wearing high heels, so that should put the hem at the perfect height - just grazing the floor. the slit is high enough to be sexy and daring, but not totally slutty. i bought a large, and was worried about looking like a stuffed sausage because costumes typically run smal, but the dress fits perfectly...not too tight, but clingy in all the right places. the fabric drapes wonderfully, and even though it is inexpensive i think it looks nice enough for the occasion. as other reviewers have said, the cups are pretty small. i'm a 36c - everything is covered that is supposed to be, but if you're much larger than me you may have some issues fitting the girls in those cups. even though there is an underwire (which was poking through the material on one side), the dress has very little support so i'll be wearing a strapless push-up. i agree also that the straps are pretty flimsy, but they do stay on my shoulders when i adjust them and shouldn't be a problem with the strapless bra underneath. in summary, i'd say it's a good buy if you're looking for something glamorous without spending a lot of money.
62901	i have big feet, flat feet, over-pronating feet and a larger build for a runner. i have always had issues with running, until i started using these. i have totally switched into a minimalist footwear person and it has changed my life. these shoes are my standbys. the vibram classics go on easy and are beyond comfy. i wear them running, walking, hiking and casually. they hold up great and make a huge impact on my foot health. my one suggestion is to find these in person before you buy them on amazon, just to make sure they will fit you. a lot of people cannot wear vibrams because your feet have to be just right for them.
63008	i know ck usually runs a little small, but even going up a size didn't work and i didn't want to waste my time ordering another. the 34 band is more like a 30 and a c cup wouldn't of fit in the dd. very unhappy because it is a good quality bra, the sizing is just too off to not buy in store.
63212	i love this petticoat.  i chose the black one.  i've seen some more luxurious-looking petticoats, but i preferred this because of the price.  it provided perfect poof under my swing-style dress.  the length was perfect. also, i am a us 2x and had no problem wearing this one-size petticoat.  all these features are great, but that's not what earned the 5-star rating.  it has a smooth underskirt layer which kept the prickly tulle away from my legs.  i wear hosiery and i was worried when i put it on that i would be fighting snags. nope, the smooth underskirt adds a layer of poof and protects your hosiery from snags.  i plan to go ahead and get a white or pink one.
63224	(i'm tall and wear a size 11/12 with a 26 inch waist) very happy to have such a great crinoline at such as low cost price. much more flouncy than imagined though be careful how you pull it on as all netting is delicate and can tear. if you want petticoats showing a bit or a lot then one thing to note is that this will not work with below knee length and above knee swing dresses (heartbreaker sweetie dress or hell bunny mayday dress for example) this works best with mini (not micro mini or costume micro mini) or mid thigh length dresses like unique vintage mini swing halter dress or friday on my mind dixie dress. if you just want a bell shape with no flounce showing then this will work with some longer dresses for a hoop skirt effect. waist will not be comfortable past about 36 inches but can still be worn by a bigger gal just be careful getting it on. unless you have a super tiny waist (20 to 24 inches) and want a dramatic effect there is enough volume to not need a second skirt. great deal for the quality!! will be buying all the colors and hoping they make more.
63236	"this is the shirt you would wear into the desert.  it is very light, quick drying and white.  you can wash this shirt in a sink and hang it to dry and it would be ready to wear in no time.  it fits a little tight and the arms are a little too short.  (xxl on a 6'3"" frame).  the white did not work for me because i got it too dirty doing water sports, but if you love walking in the heat, this shirt would be perfect."
63245	i usually settle with medium because i have broad neck and shoulders, but with exofficio i'm able to happily wear a small where the arms are the right length.  compared to standard fitting clothes i'd say exofficio runs big as rule of thumb, but for people that aren't petite they are great.they are thin without being see-through and have sort of cheese cloth-ish vents running down the sides wear a seam usually runs.  it is about an inch wide, if you look closely you can see it in the picture.  at first i thought you'd be able to see through it, but unless you are wearing a size that is too small and as a result it is skin tight- people shouldn't be able to see through the shirt.  long story short it is an athletic type shirt, but you could easily wear it around the office unless you work in a true professional setting it shouldn't be a problem.a lot of their button shirts are advertised as &#34;uv protection&#34; and &#34;bug repellent&#34;, i don't have any review on the authenticity to this.  i mean i've never gotten a sunburn while wearing a shirt... maybe it's different when you are fishing or out in the wild?  and the bug repellent?  no idea, i don't see how it'd last after you wash it; otherwise, wouldn't all of the clothes washed at the same time also benefit from the bug repellent technology?  anyways neither of these features are advertised for this particular shirt so this is just my 2 cents on the brand's advertising gimmicks.overall i love these shirts because they actually fit, shoulders, chest, and arm length; neck too.  they are also nice and comfy while retaining the look of a casual shirt.  the fit alone makes it worth the premium price, all the other stuff is just icing on the cake.just a heads up i've seen these products fluctuate a lot day to do as much as $25-$30 depending on the mood amazon is in.  sometimes the seller changes too which makes a difference in shipping times, especially if you are a prime member.i've bought 4 of exofficio shirts and a pair of their give-n-go boxers.  all of them have been outstanding and met my expectations which is worth mentioning considering their prices are pretty incredibly high.
63283	this is a initial impression review because i just unpacked this watch set the time/date and adjusted the links to fit my wrist.  i will write another review in a couple months time and add on to this.i like to wear different watches everyday and i like some color in my watches.  i own a lot of g-shocks and swatches.  i have never owned any fancy expensive watches.  i think i have never paid over 150 bucks for a watch.  just so when you read my review you can tell where i am coming from.  i know with all the watches i have bought i could of bought one really nice watch, but then i would be stuck wearing that one watch everyday.  plus i just want to look different than all the other people at work.right out of the box, the watch impressed me.  it looks and feels like it should of cost me a lot more than i paid for it.  i bought a invicta before and i wish i would of saved that money for an orient.  sure i don't know a lot about quality watches because of my g-shocks and swatches, but this watch does seem like very good quality.  i read a lot of reviews about entry level dive watches and i was very interested in getting the sieko orange monster and it only costs about sixty dollars more.  the thing that got me to decide on this watch over the sieko is this watch has the black bezel and it helps set the orange off really nicely.so far i am happy with my purchase and i will update my review in a couple months, if all goes well with this watch i believe i will pick up the blue faced version, because that one is very elegant looking to me.i picked up a16 pcs watch tool kitand used it to shorten the length very easily, i will use this also to change out the band from time to time, because i picked up the following bands to try out with it.22mm double tang modena italian rubber dive watch band fits luminoxseries: 3000 original navy seal dive series, etc.orange 22mm double tang modena italian rubber dive watch band fits luminoxseries: 3000 original navy seal dive series, etc.orange 22mm modena president / submariner style italian rubber watch band w/ deployant / deployment buckle / clasp22mm pvd james bond black / tan / orange - nylon nato ballistic military watch band strap g-10 fit's all!!
63303	"got these for my husband for christmas.  they are the only boots he ever wears.  i've been buying the same boots from amazon for years.  every year i buy him these same boots because he loves them.  they are sturdy, yet comfortable and really hold up.  he really gets alot of wear out of them, so they are a good deal for the money.  they keep their ""new"" look for a long time.  and the service is quick !  if they ever stop making these boots i don't know what he'll do.  they're a reliable old favorite of his."
63320	i love this bra. the cup shape is nice and flattering, and it has great support! the straps are comfortable, which is a precious commodity when you're a ddd. the band doesn't creep up your back, the side band doesn't dig into you, and the underwire isn't noticeable at all. it's a great bra all around! and it has just enough lining in it to preserve your modesty when you're cold. i'm definitely ordering another one.
63333	the timex &#34;easy reader&#34; has it all --indiglo (night viewing)clear, legible dialcontrasting black handssoft leather bandgold-tone finishfamous timex reliabilityit looks classy, and it reads easy -- what's not to like !??my order arrived promptly and in perfect condition.
63395	it is what it is and does what it does, no more, no less. solved a problem .. i needed a link removed. certainly no easy way to do it with standard home tools. no small town, local jewelry store, they have all gone out of business. found this inexpensive little tool that lets me do it myself. it works and i accomplished the task simply and easily. what more can i say?
63409	first the pin bent and when i tried to straighten it, it broke off. there were no other pins included in the packaging, although there's a really nice photo that shows extra pins. while fiddling with the device the handle came apart in two pieces. no instructions are included, although it's possible to google some good sites. buy something more dependable or go to the jeweler!
63464	my husband is so excited about these slippers.  i had earlier purchased a pair of foamtread's for myself and wanted to try them for him since he now has partial neuropathy of the feet and suffers pain.  i figured the memory foam inside would help some.he loves the fact that the velcro closures are not only in the arch area, but also around his heel.  he loves the cushiony feel of them.  he is very pleased.
63525	these socks are very pretty.  i love the fall colors.  they are very warm and for the price i was expecting the inside of the socks to be smooth...but there are threads from the embroidery that was catching on my toes as i tried to slip them on.
63540	really like these socks. interesting and attractive and unusual but average quality. will hand wash and air dry. well worth the effort.
63591	liked the color of this hat, buuuuuut,,,,,, once again not made with enough material. surprisingly the darker colors of this hat fits fine, but the lighter colors don't.  whats up with that ???? not good,,,,,,, this hat will only maybe fit a child with a small head. grrrrrrr :(
63640	this would have been a great purse if the beyond cheap shoulder strap was made out of leather instead of plastic.  it doesn't even truly match the color of the purse!  if they made the shoulder strap wider and out of matching leather then this would be a perfect purse.  plenty of room and wonderful pockets!!  for the price it still is a great buy.  just the right size and made fairly well (except for the shoulder strap)!!
63723	"what curdles my lunch more often than not, is that nobody seems to proofread their descriptions anymore.  did anyone catch the first statement?  ""100% leather"".  really?  cotton leather, no less.  that said, they are right about 100% cotton.  but the same make & model i got from kohl's was a blend of polyester and cotton.  and except for one reviewer, you have no idea what the width is.  i have many narrower than 1 1/2"" wide loops on some pants.  but i do like this size webbing as it isn't as wimpy as the military issue.  this one is also easier to slip a tape measure hook over the top of it because of it's beefiness.  you will get a very decent web belt in this one.  and the price here (at this time) is a deal."
63733	web belts are important purchases - much more so than people think: web belts will be with you possibly for the rest of your life, since there's just no way to kill one of these things. this is no (sneer) leather belt. so choose well, my friend, choose well.not mentioned in the product description is the belt's height (hopefully this has changed since our purchase, but if not, note that the belt height is two inches). two inches. solid, this one is; substantial. think of this belt the way one used to think about doctors, or banks, or cars, but can't anymore...
63795	after buying belts that looked like this columbia belt and finding that they were rubbish and of poor quality i added one of these baby's to my last order. they are very good. the material is strong with a good weave. the buckle is sturdy and  easily holds the belt fabric  when the pin is in place. truly, they look good, are easy to adjust, and for the price they are a terrific extra to add to your main order. i think this belt will give me good service for a long time. thank you to the people for the other reviews. these reviews help me decide on my purchases.
63884	within weeks of first using my new dockers braid belt, a couple of the braids broke and now hang loosely.  one broken braid is about 3 inches from the buckle end and the other is about half-way down the belt.  i do not recommend this belt.
63887	some of the reviews say that this belt runs small.  actually, it is spot on.  the normal procedure for the purchase of a belt is to order 2 sizes larger than your slack or pant size.  this is not a malfunction in the belt, it is just they way it has always been done.  if you normally where a size 34, then purchase a size 38 and your belt will fit in the middle hole...just right!  as to the belt, itself; it is very nice, especially for the price.
63931	i ordered two sizes larger than i needed as other reviews suggested.  the belt is a little too big for me and i wish i had ordered only one size bigger than my waist.  the belt is very stiff and the build quality is decent.  i'd purchase the belt again.  i've had it a few weeks and use it nearly every day.  it's holding up well.
63933	thos is just what i wanted!!! execellent finished, real leather, and fits like a glove. i was looking for a belt like this for the past 13 months and finally i got it!!!!!
63986	stay away from maroon. period. it is a dark magneta colour. it looks quite awful for its colour combination, almost look like cheaply made although the material feels quite good. please, just stay away from this colour. looks so cheap in the end.
64008	this is my fourth minnetonka purchase. as expected, the quality is superb, the fit is excellent, and the comfort is undeniable. i couldn't be happier with these slippers. they're perfect!
64054	this is almost as comfortable as a sports bra, but doesn't give you uni-boob.  it takes off 2-3 inches and is also not ugly, like so many other minimizer bras.  i love this brand and style, and will buy it again.  actually, this is the third one i've owned.
64091	these are well made and fit my husband great.  the only negative is there are no pockets other than that they're a very good value for what you pay.
64198	updated 11/9/2011..... still beautiful, wear everyday, solid never a loose or lost stone, and i still get complements on them all the time. will buy another pair for myself in case i lose 1 of these. they are my favorite non real diamond pair of earrings i own. they look so real!i got these for myself, and got complements on them right away. i am someone who does not change my earrings unless it is a special occasion, so these look like diamonds studs with out the price tag, and i am nervous i would lose my diamonds if i wore them on a day to day basis, and these are a great substitute. great size, not to big or small, maybe to large for a petite woman with small features, but will look nice on most. i am now ordering a pair for my mom as a gift!
64228	"i gave these earrings to my sister for her 28th birthday in august and she still gets compliments on them everywhere she goes! the photos truly do not do them justice, they are so gorgeous with a hint of antique to them. my sister decided to buy another piece from the ""100 facets collection"" because she loves them so much. they are so sparkly and are a completely believable size diamond!"
64304	seriously, i had 2 nightgowns that i could never find a replacement for. i wore them for about 15 years because nothing else was comfortable enough. now i found the shadowline gowns and i can throw away the rags (they were pretty much transparent by now). so far i have 3. after the first one (seafoam), i got a red, loved it too and then got peri (which is also beautiful). they run true-to-size, lightweight, dry quickly, not too delicate to be washed and dried in the machine, cool enough in summer and sufficiently warm enough this winter. non-restrictive, perfect length (i am 5'6 and they go to my ankles). i am so happy i found them. they arrived quickly by the way.
64342	"so, to preface, i'm on a quest to find a black leather pump that i can wear while i'm on my feet all day. i work in a bank, so i need to look professional, but i also need to be comfortable, because i don't want to be limping, or changing shoes, or downing pain meds because my bunions are burning, or just plain old thinking about my sore feet while at work. i have tried on about a dozen different brands and styles of pumps at this point.i'm teetering between giving this pump 4 or 5 stars. it gets 5+ stars for initial comfort, but i have only tried it on and haven't spent a day on my feet yet! regardless, finding a shoe that is even initially comfortable is very difficult for me. i wear a 9 1/2 in wides - the wide is to accommodate bunions - yet the back of my foot is more narrow, and i have high arches. so basically, i have fussy feet that are hard to dress.on top of that, i like to wear more stylish shoes, which is nearly impossible with the state of my feet. i'd love to wear 3-inch pointy toed pumps, but it's not in the cards. that's why i would want to take away a star or two, this shoe is really boring. a basic low-heeled leather pump. nothing excited, but better than some other ""comfortable, all-day"" pumps i've tried on recently that look like they are relics from the 90's. these pumps don't make me feel like a grandma, but they are most definitely not sexy or exciting.so, to summarize - yes, they are super duper comfortable, but they are also quite dull. they meet my expectations and i will keep them. thus ends my quest for low-heeled black leather pumps."
64366	i bought these for my husband, he is a 9 1/2 eee.  we listened to other reviewers and bought one size bigger then the next size up which was an 11 in our case.  it was way to big.  we are returning them for a size 10.  if you are a 1/2 size and a wide width, i would suggest only going up 1/2 a size, not 1 & 1/2.  the shoes are beautiful, will definitely get a replacement pair.  edit:  new pair came in and hubby is very happy, he loves how they fit and how warm they are.  the size 10 fit perfect.
64496	"i was hoping these would fit but didn't work that way. the child wears a size 2 shoe but these are even too short, as well as quite tight for her. so i guess she needs the wide size instead, although for regular shoes she is fine. sizing is a major problem when buying online.  the shoe is good quality and well made and easy to wear.  but the sizes run a bit small.why are these called ""adult slippers""?  as i know the adult size range it starts at either 5 or 6 us."
64519	stitching was horrid. zipper did not work at all. as a capezio patron for many years, i was quite simply shocked at the overall poor quality of this leotard.
64572	i am a 38c and my size fits me perfectly. it is super comfortable and supportive for all day wear, even when working out. if you follow the washing instructions (wash on delicate cycle and hang up to dry) and store it how you should it will last and last. they are always sold out of my size and preferred color in local stores, so thank god for amazon availability. i will be wearing this bra for the foreseeable future unless something changes.
64576	this bra has it all -- comfort and shaping and coverage.  plus it's completely invisible under clothes, even thin cotton t-shirts.  the lift comes from a pad at the bottom.  this bra does not have the kind of padding you find in a full scale push-up.  it has just enough to do the job, and creates a much more natural look than most push-ups do.
64606	i think name of this bra indicates that it is absolutely a function over form bra, so it's pretty much what i was expecting. it's comfortable&#8212;the straps are wide, the fabric isn't scratchy, and the four-hook back is very supportive. it fits very well and is true to size. there's a slight uniboob effect, but nothing to the extent of an ill-fitting sports bra. i wouldn't wear it under a thin blouse or dress, but other than that, it's pretty good.
64608	i bought 2 of these bras, i love them. i bought 5 more.  why waste my time always looking for a perfect bra.  well i found it, i am very top heavy and i actually have a lift now plus my shoulder straps don't hurt. i have paid a lot more for other bras that don't have support and comfort as this one. a great light bra, thank you playtex for the active lifestyle bra.
64624	it gives you choices of colors and  with the diffident colors the styles will change.  these are comfortable bras and at a great price.  i usually wear a 38c but found that in this name brand i have to step down a size.
64634	"i wanted a 34d bra with good support and lift, and i thought this one would work well for me, but it felt more like a chest-flattening ""binder"". maybe it was designed to eliminate ""bounce"" during volley ball games? i returned it and found my ideal bra: playtex 18 hour #4693 original comfort strap bra [http://www.amazon.com/playtex-womens-original-comfort-sailor/dp/b005xi5o14/ref=sr_1_1?s=apparel&ie=utf8&qid=1337578025&sr=1-1]"
64681	this is such an amazing hot (and convenient) product, i highly recommend it. the waist strap fits me to a t, and i am a 28-30 inch waist. it didn't dig into my skin as it gave a perfect stretch. the only part that didn't fit as well as the top lace part of the stocking entrance. the thigh high top would dig into my upper let a bit, but that's my fault since i'm too lazy to tone my legs. the nylon material didn't run until my 5th use, but i was rough on them. when i say these are convenient, i mean that the connected garter straps never detach or get stuck against dresses as full tights sometimes do. my boyfriend loves these as much as i do, and we both highly recommend this product for those in the market for decently priced stockings! :)
64682	kind of a novelty item. great for people who buy a bunch of crap so as to look like &#34;serious&#34; runner. my wife wanted one so i bought this it turned out to be more dandy than handy (inside joke) but i wouldn't really recommend it. but if you are set on this type of thing this one is warm and fits well machine washable and it should work for people with pony tails in cold weather like syberian carnival operators.
64711	i bought this as a gym/swim bag, and it's the perfect size for that.  very sturdy construction and quality materials, and it looks good too (i have the maroon bag).  i use the main compartment for clothes/toiletries, mesh side pocket for swim gear and anything wet, long side pocket for keys/wallet/misc., and the far side pocket for shoes/sandals.  the only problem i can see with this bag is that if your shoes/sandals are larger than a us men's size 9, they won't fit in the side pocket and you'd have to put them in the main compartment along with your clothes... yuck.  but otherwise, this is a great bag.edit: i'm upgrading to five stars because this bag is super durable!!  after 2 years of constant use and exposure to chlorinated water, it still looks new.  the design is excellent, and the construction is top notch.  highly recommend!!
64748	i bought these as a christmas gift for my wife, and she loves them. the outer leather shell seems fairly durable, yet supple and pliant...the cashmere lining inside is warm and wicks away moisture to keep your hands dry. very happy with this purchase.
64809	a little disappointed - ordered this belt in gold specifically because the buckle is also shown in gold and all the other gold belts i was looking at had silver buckles. but when i got it, the buckle is silver. it still looks nice when i wear it (though it's a little wider than i wanted, was hoping for a skinny belt but as i mentioned, most skinny belts had silver buckles and of course now that doesn't make any difference). i have worn it three times and the belt is starting to show buckle marks next to the hole i use. so i know i won't get much wear out of it before it looks worn out. but for the price, this was to be expected.
64812	i have been looking for plain, solid colored belts without all of the diamonds and studs that are out in stores. the ones i can find never seem to fit. this belt fits great and i intend on reordering several more in different colors. it arrived on time without any issues.
64823	this belt was just as i expected it to be. it seems like it will be a belt to last quite a while.
64846	sizing was a very significant concern for me as items tend to 'run' differently when measured as xl, 1x, 2x and so on. if you measure as amazon describes and note where the measurement begins and ends you will get a very accurate fit.
64870	don't remember buying this product but i think it was good, maybe on the thinner side if that's what you're looking for
64907	this is a fantastic bag.  it has a zipper inside that doesn't completely prevent you from reaching in to grab a cell phone - it's like a middle zip, allowing access to the ends (if that makes sense).  it has 2 additional small inner zippered compartments and an exterior zippered section.  i bought this for my pre-teen to use as an overnight bag.  even women's with size 6 tennis shoes and a change of clothing, the bag  can hold it all.  she loves it!  very stylish.
64982	very nice, perfect size, looks great, expensively than it is. i bought it as a gift but like it so much that i kept it for myself! shame on me... i'll get another one for my friend...
65003	"i ordered both colors and i am in love with these lounge sets.they are so soft, warm, and cuddly.  i just  love hanging out in them during these cold new england winter months and hate taking them off.  the top also looks nice worn separately with slacks or jeans and can easily be dressed up with a scarf or jewelry.  they launder beautifully with no shrinkage.  just as a guide to how sizes run:  i originally  ordered xl, as i am 5'4"" @ 170 lbs.  they were way too big.  i  returned them for large and the large is perfect.  the seller was great in accomodating the return, however they require the customer to pay s&h for returns, which i think was $4.95.  couldn't be happier with this purchase!"
65013	comfortable shoe, but as far as working out your lower half. i would say no. i have had these for over a year and there is no difference. they are extremely expensive
65047	this raybans are made in china. this fact has to be informed. they are not the same quality as the italians. great dissapointment!
65086	i bought the cinnamon colored wrap, and it is a very warm coppery brown. i was worried that the color might be too dark or too orangey, but it is neither. it is very much the way the color is pictured. this wrap can be elegant and classy for a night out or can be worn casually with everyday skirts or jeans. it is very versatile and flattering. the jacquard pattern is subtle but adds texture and depth. price can't be beat for the product. very pleased!
65144	it fit me with a little room left in the store.i got size 30&#34;w x 32&#34;l but i usually wear 29&#34;waist for most brands.and after washing it shrunk. so far, after 2 wash, it feels like i'm wearing a size 28&#34;w x 30&#34;l.it's a tight squeeze, i was hoping that it would loosen up and fit better,but it just gets tighter and tighter.basically buying 501 is a gamble, since you never know what size the jeans will shrink down to.
65154	i read the reviews before ordering them and based on that, ordered a size smaller than i'd usually wear, however, they are still quite a bit too big  of course, when i went to order them in a size 7, they were all $24 vs. the $14 i'd paid for the first pair.  too bad.
65207	for an 8 year olds first jewelery box, it was a very nice gift, she loved it very much, and has already filled it with all the jewelery she has ! the price was a little high, but not to high for a lenox product i guess ! thank you !
65269	got this as a gift for my son and he absolutely loves it. at first i thought it was going to be too large but its not. i have a large wrist and it just fits my wrist on the last notch. the strap is very firm so if you don't like that kind of thing take note of that. it secures itself well with a the strap ring that has a notch for the end of the strap to fit into. there are 5 buttons total the main black one is for &#34;indiglo&#34; the other are for mode and set functions. the compass works well and has adjustments for it as well. come with basic digital functions extra alarms, timers, chrono etc. shock resistant, dull od green in color nothing on this watch glows btw. feels like a very tough watch and im sure it will be tested by my son sooner than later :-) the dark screen is easy to read which is good i was worried about that. glad i got this rather than the &#34;other&#34; shock brand watch very pleased.
65273	iv'e had this for abotu a month. the band is so hard that if you have a slightly large wrist it's like wearing a handcuff. the light, is almost non-existant, and to top it all off the battery died in two weeks. during that time i wore it twice... the rest fo the tiem it was in a drawer!
65274	i am totally blown away with the quality of this watch. i did not expect it to be as well made as it is. the digital compass feature works spectacularly well for my needs (i have compared it to every compass i have in the house and it is spot on), and it is extremely simple to calibrate (the screen walks you through it). it keeps good time, and i don't think i will ever worry about wearing it in harsh environments. the only reason it didn't get 4 start is because i would like to see the digital display to be a bit brighter.
65275	this is a great watch.  there is a youtube video about it.  it is a big watch.  it is a tough watch and well suited for military use with the digital compass and hydration modes along with timers and 3 time zones.  it is not a dive watch but it is water resistant to 200 meters.  of course the timex indiglo is hard to beat.  if you want a reasonably priced watch with great features you have found it with the timex t49612.
65286	love the coat, however it is not the pretty color it potrays in the picture. in all actuality it is an ugly rust color..
65402	i bought this as a replacement for another similar champion shirt, so at first we were disappointed at the slight textured appearance of this shirt (instead of smooth and silky).  anyway, my husband kept it, likes it, and will probably get more.  the price is very good, quality is good, sizing is accurate, it wicks away moisture, does not shrink--very simple wash and dry, and does not wrinkle.  so, it's a big winner after all!  great for exercising and sports or just for a comfortable shirt to look casual but presentable (no carbs either!).
65449	bought this for my husband to wear at the beach - it helps protect him from burning since he hates to wear sunscreen.  it dries very fast and doesn't cling when it's wet - perfect for swimming in!it also protects his chest after hours on the body board...no more brush burns on his stomach!
65598	love the shirt fits well and i like the blue color. not sure what else to say other than its a good shirt as good as some of the major brands and for a lot less. way to go champion!!!
65680	all in one loafer.  like walking on a cloud, and with the cute shine and embossing they look more expensive too.  nice under slacks but also cute with skirts and tights.  i get lots of compliments on these with slacks at work
65801	though they look nice and do help on pronating ankles, the bottoms are so hard i find them hard to wear and tend to go for other things.  i would not suggest  these orthoheels (they are coming out with some that have a suede footbed and perhaps they would be better.  i would prefer birkenstock for somebody with a pronating ankle.  the orthaheels are just too darned hard on your foot, with all the best intentions!
65830	"having recently moved into a new home that had granite tile in the kitchen/dining/living room areas, i needed some kind of shoes to protect my feet and legs from standing on such a hard surface.  these shoes fit the bill nicely.  they are the first orthopedic shoes i've ever worn, but they won't be the last!  they provide great support in the arch, and cushion and support my feet, providing proper alignment of my legs/knees/hips so that the floors do not bother me.  i bought them in black, and i like the way they look.  the strip of black patent leather gives them a little pop.  still, they aren't exactly ""pretty"" shoes, so i deduct one star for that.  i normally wear a size 7, and that size fit me perfectly.  a warning, though:  do not expect them to be really comfy right out of the box.  they won't be.  you must break them in an hour or so at a time at first, but after a few days, they mold to your feet, and the straps across the top of your feet will no longer ""rub"" and make red marks.  i love them, and cannot do without them now."
65843	the contour does help with my plantar fasciitis to an extent, but the unyielding, hard plastic of the footbed starts to create pain of its own after an hour or so of wear. these sandals are rock hard and i can feel my heel hitting them. the arch is, perhaps, too high for my feet. it was very painful the first day, less so after several days wearing them, but never became comfortable or pain-free. i've downgraded these to wearing around outside the house in the garden and yard, but cannot wear them for extended walking on concrete or any other hard flooring.the upright between the toes is extremely harsh; blister-making.these are, for me, in the category of better than sandals with no support or contouring, but still not good.
65847	tell your friends...tell your family...tell the clerk at the grocery store.  these shoes are really great and so healthy for your feet.  (this is my third pair)
65930	these boots are very cute and really comfy, but run about 1/2 size too large. i still love them though!
65933	i love my new boots and get tons of compliments on them. i've always wanted a similiar pair of boots but was wary about ordering them online. i have wide feet and bigger muscular calves. so, i was prepared to mail them back upon arrival, knowing for sure they'd be too snug.  but they fit pefectly, with even a little wiggle room around my calves. i've worn these with jeans, skirts, and dresses and always get compliments on how cute they are. i tell everyone amazon.com and so affordable! i plan on putting many many miles in these shoes! :)
66081	i'll start by saying the first pair of leggings were great, so i ordered a second pair and got yoga pants that are at least six inches too long. do i want to mess with returns on an item this small?? no! i just won't order again.
66090	i bought these because as seen in the photo they sit higher on the waist. i love them. i am 5'5, 130lbs, and roughly a size 6. a medium was perfect. great quality material and seams.
66092	they are great but very high waist.  thin fabric. perfect for me as i needed white thin underpants. good buy.
66154	i was skeptical at first when i opened this up.  i hadn't looked very closely at the picture, and saw the little dangling thing that looked like a zipper pull and the seam down the front, so it looked like it opened up to get feet in and out easily, but i found out differently upon delivery.  no zipper, you have to shove your foot in and pull it all the way out.  i had expected it to be a problem since usually that means the boots feel loose if it's easy enough to slide in, or if the boot still fits snugly, that means it's a real pain getting feet in and out.this one is snug, but the foot goes in easily and comes out easily.  draw strings on top to help keep a lot of snow from falling in if you're outside playing in the white stuff, can snug it up on top of the foot if you need, and they are surprisingly comfortable.  feel very good and solid when walking around in them, and enough insulation to keep the feet from freezing.so far, these are the best snow boots i've found in 25 years of adulthood...
66247	i enjoyed having these for my vacation trip to see my sister.  they fit perfectly in a little cranny in my suitcase, not heavy or bulky, but made me feel like a princess when i put them in.  a really feminine ballet slipper in a pearl satin with a little bow and decorated with rhinestones.  so cute,
66278	first of all, these boots are adorable! i was apprehensive about the layer of faux fur around the top, but it works. second, these boots can hold their own! that's right, ladies, they're not just fashionable, they're durable and waterproof! i wore these boots every single moment i was outside on my trip to snowy northern michigan and tromped around in knee high snow without getting my socks wet or my feet cold. i trudged happily along icy sidewalks without feeling vulnerable to slipping or falling. i'm not saying you will not fall, always use caution, but i always felt very secure. these are comfy, effective, and cute!
66284	sorel makes a great snowboot, and these are no exception.  very comfortable and warm, completely snow/waterproof.  i walk a mile to work every day in boston weather and these have been amazing.i got the purple color for a little more flair than the usual neutral boots and i enjoy them,  the neon orange stripe was a little much for me, so i used a black sharpie to cover the orange and then they were perfect :)
66338	i bought these cute boots for gardening/yard work in an area with a lot of creepy crawlers. they are extremely comfortable, like my uggs. also great in the rain and muck. i ordered size 8 and my usual size is 7.5 m. perfect fit even with cotton sox. the color is very close to the photo, no complaints there. the value in these boots is outstanding and i highly recommend them.
66340	i love these.  they fit so well, the shape of it really hugs your feet.  the light green is so pretty and really brighten up a rainy day.  i also wear these to walk our dog through wet morning grass.  they're very slip-proof too, i'll post a picture of the soles.  the heel also has a little nub that sticks out which makes it easy for you to use one foot to step on it and take off your boot.i kinda have a hard time believing they were so inexpensive for the great quality.  it really makes me feel that this company cares about boots and wants people to have nice rain/gardening boots made in the usa.
66344	"i've had my pair of sloggers midsummer tallboot for almost a year now. i use them with my pants tucked in for exercising my german shepherd in a local field, at the beach and when i garden. i'd say on average i wear them about five times a week and they still look like new. after each wearing i simply hose off the grass, mud or sand and set them aside to dry. i normally wear an 8 1/2 but ordered the size 9 and my toes can wiggle and are comfortable. i found the insole quite comfortable as is, but in the winter i add another insole to add some extra warmth. sloggers is my go to ""outdoorsy"" brand now and i'm very happy with my purchase."
66397	i typically buy a 7.5 women's shoe, these fit snug in 8. i've had them since may and it is nov. so far so good. i love the way they fit.
66425	they're very nice, but i had to rate them in the middle because being a boot, i expected it to be a little wider than it is.  as it is, i'm not able to put my foot in them.  i have to give them away to someone with a smaller foot.  so, if you decide to buy it, buy it one or two sizes bigger than your normal shoe size.
66500	these boots are tight over the top of the foot and then big in the toe for an uncomfortable fit. not as cute in person as the photo.
66516	i wear 8 1/2 or 9 regular women's wide width. so i ordered a 10 in these. long enough,good toe room, but these just felt too snug when pulling them on, & are too tight across the instep. i exchanged for 11's- - still too tight,which is crazy, 11's in any other shoe or boot would be huge on me! i also wish the top opening was wider.i tend to think that boots should be sized to fit a bit oversized,but these are sized soo small! don't be afraid to order bigger than you think you need. the product description should say:not for wide feet.  :(pros: they look darling & are very nicely made - and i do think the footbed would be comfy/supportive.exchange/refund experience was easy. (these were the light green ones- sold and shipped by amazon as the seller)
66550	bought for my nephew with the whip and hat for a birthday.  it completes the look and wears well.  over a year old and has seen lots of use.  still fine.
66659	i had purchased a similar slip at a local store of this same brand, so that is why i purchased these online.  i'm glad i did.  the sizes are what i consider generous, and i could have actually ordered one smaller size down.  however, it still fits nicely and does fall below the knee as shown in the picture-which is exactly what i wanted.  i'm ready for my summer skirt collection!
66695	i have never owned a pair of andrew chritian briefs before. the fabric and cut of this style is great. it would be advisable to get a size larger thn usual as it will provide the room needed for comfort.they are a little more expensive than i am used to spending, but well worth the money.
66727	i bought this dress in the black and the white, size 1x. i don't think it's as obvious to potential buyers as it should be that evogue apparel's plus sizes for for juniors. i'm 43. a size 12 in jeans and a 38d. this dress fit perfectly. i also want to mention that it's lined so no need to wear a slip.  the lining is already a slip-like material (rayon?) so it hangs well.
66729	i was extremely excited to order & receive this dress....and massively disappointed when i received it.  the design of the dress is wonderful, i like the cut and everything. as most people have said the chest area is quite tight....but what was very disappointing is the material. the dress is very itchy, very hot, very uncomfortable. i decided to send it back because of the material it's made out of....would not recommend purchasing based on the dress material.
66758	these boots were great. they served the purpose for which they were intended. great for work and looked good too.
66773	ok, it's not sexy like the painted ones, or even textured like the diamond criss-cross ones, but this is my go-to shoe when i know i'll be on my feet for hours on end. clogs don't fit quite like other shoes: the heel is designed to be loose, so you'll feel your foot slip out a bit when you push off the toe box. it's designed to allow your foot to move normally while providing sold protection around your tender feet.
66794	"the woman in the photo must be seven feet tall. i'm 5'6"" and this was more than half way to my ankles. i wish i would have measured it before i packed it back up - there is no way the shortest length is 23 inches.the slip was well made, otherwise. i would have liked it had it been usable."
66815	as expected from the other reviews, these crocs are sized smaller than my previous crocs.  i  thought it would be fine because i'm a size 7 and that's what i purchased, rather than the usual of people having issues when they attempt to go down by half a size.  my pair of malindi crocs fit more comfortably.  looking at them side by side, it is clear that although they have similar profiles, the olivia is narrower and shorter.  as with another reviewer, i found that the opening caused issues for my little toe.  not sure why this is when the openings on my malindi and mary jane crocs were never an issue.  i will try the heat and stretch to see if i can get the fit to improve.
66896	it's just as it's described, warm, lightweight, breathable. it does everything i expect it to do at a low price, plus it fits well, and is versatile as to how it's worn.  money well spent.
66898	save your money get anything else. to short to cover your neck.stinks washing does not get the smell out i'll try to return but dont know if i will be able to since i washed it really bad.no i do not recommend
66900	this balaclava is the definition of junk.  it looks great in the photo, and the description sounds fantastic.  in reality?  it's thin material, not long enough to cover the neck (& i am a small/short woman) & has a ton of strings & plastic tabs for adjustment that don't even make sense and they hang in your face no matter what you do.  you can try all you want, but the plastic pieces just move around & don't actually make any adjustments to the fit.  it says the material is polar fleece, but it is thin like microfleece.  i'm trying to retun the item for a refund.  i can't believe i actually spend money on this!
66940	abolutely love these boots!! i got half a size bigger than i usually wear & they fit perfect. very comfy, would recommend.
66947	these are nice looking boots and they are comfortable but i just do not like that they are slippery.  i keep sliping on the floor with them, i wish the bottom was made out of a less slippery rubber like the rubber they use on sneaker bottoms.
66976	i have a pretty standard shaped foot and these did not fit at all. i could get my big toe and the next two in but the last two toes would not even come close to the toes of the shoe. i've heard great things about these so i will not say they are not comfortable just that they did not work for me.i bought a pair of merrell barefoot true glove that look more like regular shoes and they fit and feel great.
66983	title says it all- ended up wearing these in a situation early in the process of breaking myself into them where i couldn't change out when i need to, and i ended up with a tendon/foot cramp that was making me think stress fracture. the company includes guidelines on getting accustomed to these shoes, and i recommend listening to them about it. i'm not a super-heavy guy, either.ps- find a place where you can physically try these on before purchasing, or be prepared to do some back-and-forth mailing until you get the right ones. sizes run slightly different from model to model, and you can't count on their sizing chart to tell you what's going to be right for you.
67059	i didn't care for this slip because the top part was all lace which will show through a dress.  i was looking for more coverage and it was very baggy
67065	this can be worn under clothes or as bedroom attire. it is true to size large, at 150 lbs. and a c cup. it is not pricey and comfortable. stays on the shoulders nonetheless.
67102	i don't need to say much more - they do seem to wear quickly and the foam on the bottom is prone to holes and other abuse from objects, but they wear like slippers - what do you expect?
67109	most brands i wesr a 9 1/2 and sering as how this is a slip oon shoe i didnt want it to be to big.  its a tiny bit snug but i think it will stetch out the little big i need.  they are pretty comfortable considering there isn't much to it.  i wanted to see what all the fuss was about tbe shoe. :)
67128	its an okay bra for me.  there is little &#34;give&#34;, which holds everything in place well, but makes it a little uncomfortable.  if they'd at least make the edges of a soft material it would help.  something in the back of the strap pokes too.  not sure if its the tag or what.  i have a small rib cage but large bust, so its nice to find something with a 34 band in larger cup sizes.  that being said, if you have a larger bust, you also need a more substantial under-band so that all the lift is not coming from the straps.  seems to be well made though and breathes....even though it looks like it wouldn't.  arrived very quickly...my 15 year old son received the package and excitedly opened it, anticipating something electronic in an amazon box.  he was disappointed.
67153	i need extra support, but i find underwire bras to be universally uncomfortable.  i've had a professional fitting, so that's not the problem. this bra gives me the support i need, with good fit all around.  the 44dd i bought seems to fit true to size.
67154	i bought this style because of the soft shoulders. i don't like the smaller shoulder straps that dig into the shoulders and cause discomfort. this style will work very well!
67167	looks good. fits well.  will order another in a different color. comfortable and supportive for me with my ample bosom.yep the bra is okay but i forgot what happened last time i ordered thru these people.  i am now getting spam in my emails and catalogues i did not request.  this happened when i ordered something from them previously.  tracked down this seller thru the phone rep who helped me find out the source of all this garbage.  apparently, this seller ignore the amazon note that states providing my email and address is only for the purpose of sending the product.  will not buy from them again!!!!!!!
67207	the ad shows a false picture in case of lenght -is very much longer than in the picture: 42cm .purchased medium, leg openings are in flat position 30,5cm , both measures are wide variable by enormous ability to stretch .other features are like described, the material is thin. assorted colors are a gamble, i don't like green underwear and avoid the green one, and i'm not sure if a man serious womans can let show green underwear.the cut is very wide- and mean fabric and material , not alone the range of the gum .item was as addition to get (over 35$)free shipping with a 26 carhartt jean purchase.
67269	so many of the briefs on the market today are extremely over priced.  this product is an exception, yet the quality is still there, and the sizing is great, and they stand up to wear and washing.  it's a good buy.
67282	i love these boxer briefs, and i like the price. this is where i purchase all my underwear and socks.
67294	i loved these socks and they were so comfortable, but they didn't last a month.  they ended up with a huge hole in the bottom and then i had to toss them.  if you buy, you need to be careful with them and don't expect them to last a long time. however, i literally wore them out though and washed them alot.  to be fair, it could be my usage... but just be careful - may be best if you wear with slippers.  the company shipped very fast and i had no trouble with the seller.  i didn't reach out to them when they tore up because i didn't think it was worth it for what it was.
67362	i recomend. these ear rings are good quality and were very reasonably priced. they have a nice sparkle to them.
67363	not so sure about the quality of the product because of the size and the price but i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the stones when it finally arrived today.  i compared it to a swarovski stud earrings that i got for a friend and it shone as good as the swarovski counterpart .75 cttw for me is the perfect size.  the size i believe is not meant for those who wants big stud earrings.  the post is a little filmsy though and easily bends but it's a screwback so it's very secure when worn.  this was a gift from my husband that i personally selected and it's a good deal for it's current selling price.  you won't be disappointed!!!  i'm very happy with my gift. :)
67426	what a wonderful idea! i have always had issues with my thighs rubbing together when i wear skirts and in the summer it's a huge issue. these are the perfect solution! would highly recommend them. they're not the most attractive undergarment ever made, but they aren't as hideous as i thought they'd be.
67428	love this product.  it works like a slip but allows more movement, i.e. dancing!
67454	i have enjoyed this bra.  i am large busted and this gives me ample support without ample cleavage (if you know what i mean)  they sit in the right place, i can jump up and down, run around, dance, roll down grassy hills and they stay in place!  no wiggling out and having to excuse myself to readjust!  even though this bra has a seam in the middle of the cup it is not noticeable though clothing.  the only down side is that lace is a bit itchy when you are first breaking it in.  but well worth it.  not the bra for very low cut v-neck dresses or blouses, but most of us have that bra in our arsenal already.
67494	"below is the review that i wrote for the goddess rose banded underwire bra (didn't want to write it twice :-)).  same opinion about this bra except that is a softer bra and a tad less supportive. they are very similar; this is a great bra, too.""love this bra, it is definitely designed for large, heavy breasted women.  i think the band runs small.  i usually wear a 42g and need a 44g in this brand.  it supports beautifully and is comfortable.  i can wear it all day and don't want to yank it off as soon as i get home.  of course, not as comfortable as a non-wired, soft bra, but they don't give much support and in my experience, my breasts sag a little lower throughout the day until there is not much lift at all.  as large busted women know,it is so hard to find a bra that is comfortable and also supportive. in my experience, this is one of the best.  and...best of all, the wire lays next to my breast bone all day!  i have never worn an underwire that laid flat.  i always had some degree of the ""third boob.""  what a wonderful surprise, support without the wire poking out.  also, i am 5'1"" with a short waist and i do not have a problem with the side-boning poking under my arm.  one needs to pull excess breast tissue in front of the boning into the cup to help prevent this.  the side boning needs to lie as flat as possible.  if you have large, heavy breasts, you might be very happy with this one.  everyone is different, but it works for me."""
67576	i own way too many pairs of gloves.  i run in the early morning, even in sub-20 degree weather. from go glove through amazon, i bought these gloves, and companion mittens, recently and both are excellent.  the gloves are warm and dry in very low temps.  so far, i've run in temps down to 28.  the mittens, with liners, are awesome for early morning bike rides and walks.  both products shed the wind better than anything i've ever tried.  i may actually stop buying gloves.
67582	to small and tight for double d's, i am 42 inches around the chest over the breast and thin other wise, this stretched and the would have not held up and ripped most likely if worn, would probably be more suited to a more petite woman otherwise this is a very pretty piece and quality made
67590	i'm so happy with this purchase! these boots are so adorable, and comfortable. they definitely are a tad small, so order up if you are a half size-- or plan on wearing thick socks. these boots are just a little bit different than every other boot that's out there today, which is why i got them (who wants boring uggs, or similar knockoffs, anyway? not me!) and i couldn't be more pleased!
67612	shapeless, cheaply made, not at all flattering..... wore it once.....for only a few minutes ;o) and never again.  disappointed in this purchase.
67639	bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it.  great quality and great style.  also, customer service is very good!  definitely recommend.
67646	"i'm wearing my hat now, and it's fine.  a little itchy, but so was the one that i loved and lost.  i don't like that there are two seams, so i wear them turned to the side.  the inside is green felt which creates a ""dirty"" background as the sequins are glued onto a red mesh and the green seeps through, so to speak.  why don't they use red?  it feels and looks a little tight, but at least the band is lined with something soft, and not just the scratchy fabric back.  i wish the white band were fuzzier - it's flat, like in the photo.  the ball is a good size and not too large (sometimes they're so large they drag the hat off). all in all, it's fine, and the sequins make it cuter than average, but i'm still searching for that perfect hat.  i wouldn't be able to wear this for too long (itchy), and it's not appropriate to wear for warmth.  but it makes a cute first impression."
67707	these sock are worth every penny paid. i waffled for a long time before hitting the button to pay. the reviews helped my choice and they were right. gorgeous socks! i will wear them with my funtasma victorian boots and they are gorgeous together
67759	these are now my go-to shirt for casual wear. i have been wearing colored tees for many years. some hang like a tent, some are scratchy, some fit bad, but these are good.
67909	i am pretty impressed that i can buy three pairs of polarized sunglasses for this price. as other reviewers have noted, these glasses are very light, which might mean they are fragile, but they feel reasonably put together so far for me. other reviewers say the lenses themselves are too small, but i disagree - they are a great size. the lenses are also reasonably dark, and i tested the lenses and they are certainly polarized. all-in-all, i am happy with the purchase and if i needed more than three pairs of sunglasses i would buy more.
67930	soft n breathable good price very comfy. want to buy a few more now. you will not be upset if u are slender-large build.
67933	this is a nice light jacket for spring or fall. the material is a little too thin in my opinion which is why i subtracted a star. i know it is not supposed to be a heavy jacket, but still; the material is really thin. nice for a light covering though.
67938	the cut of these have changed. the fit is 100% for a male body builder. very broad shoulders and tapered waste. since its thin jersey material it's not super obvious on, but it's a bummer bc for the price and quality the fit isn't great on my boxier torso.
67940	i'm 165 6'1&#34; and this fits nicely. it works well for fall when you want something thin(it's very thin). definitely not for winter.
67950	"this is a very light hoodie, equal to, of even thinner than, a tee shirt. i'll probably mostly wear it around the house, in place of a sweatshirt.  most size ""large"" are comfortably loose on me but this is tight fitting. the cut is a little feminine, or maybe it's just european. it fills a gap in my wardrobe so i mostly like it."
67961	i ordered this for a wedding to be worn with a black suit. the price was right on these and liked the style from the picture. i got them the next day (prime member) and was really impressed with the quality. i had read some reviews that said they were tight and didn't breath well, but i wore them for roughly 10 hours straight the first time with no discomfort. only downside is that they look about 3 sizes bigger than they are b/c of the elongated toe box.
68052	i went into this purchase very nervous since reading the negative feedback. well first i have to say the shipper sent it lightening fast! i followed the directions(very easy) on how to adjust the belt. intially it was hard to find my size because the belt is not really flexible. but i finally got it together, tried it on, and was amazed! there is a intial plastic smell but mine went away after a day. i tried it with all my pants and was impressed-no belt buckle pooch! there has been posts about the adjuster. i guess it depends on what your size is,im a 16,  but mine hit right where my belt loop was so no pooching! this is such a good idea i wish i came up with it! im thinking of getting one in black.
68055	i purchased this item thinking that it would be a little more streamlined and not made of such hard plastic.i later found a similar product for my daughter at one third the cost and made of more flexible material which hides easier.
68080	my wife's new uggs are getting lots of use this winter and she wears them in the rain and snow.  this stuff really keeps them protected. remember to put two coats on before wearing them outside. these were used on black calf high uggs.
68098	the style is great- flat front, wrinkle free and durable. they are not &#34;slim straight&#34;! the width of the leg is the same from top to bottom. i actually have returned a few pair but had to keep the others that came later do to inconvenience. instead of saving money on these and the other 5 pair i purchased i have to have the them tailed/alterations to taper the legs from the knee to ankle.
68158	i gave this owl to a friend thinking i would order another but they have stopped production of this piece. i am happy because my friend was pleased and sad because i couldn't get another one.
68181	i am a dedicated walker.  i walk 3-5 miles every day in all seasons, so i wear out a pair of walking shoes every 9-12 months.  this model of new balance walker was comfortable from the first day - required no break in period, has no rough internal spots or fit issues.  lightweight, good traction and balanced just right for pronators and my tibial torsion.  i would purchase these again.  comparable to my 715s and much better than the 843.
68234	i bought this to wear as a pj top to match a bottom, it is a perfect fit, the sleeves are long which i like.  i haven't washed it yet and not sure how it will hold up, but for the price it is great.
68244	if you're buying this in an attempt to look super sexy for your partner, then i'd suggest buying something else. if you're just looking for a comfortable summer nightgown, i think you'll be happy with this purchase. the straps feel a bit flimsy and sometimes i worry they're going to break and the bottom does roll up on this nightgown but it's comfortable, it fits, and it was cheap so i'm happy.
68246	i am a size 10 and ordered the size large, but probably could have ordered a medium and it would have been more flattering. however, i am overall happy with the price and comfort for the price.
68264	purchased these for my son as he is very hard to fit and requires a very wide shoe.....fit great but, i was disappointed in how quickly they fell apart. for the price, the shoe did not last as long as other lower priced shoes made by new balance.
68397	"it is hard to find a good long tank top. this tank top is great one if you are looking for a solid tank top. it is durable and, it it's own way, it's way, it's stylish. i enjoy this top as much as thejess & jane tops for women-3/4 sleeve poly/span ruffle sublimation tops""paloma""(style#74-281). so if you are looking for a good tank top, this a good one to try on."
68399	i guess you get what you pay for but these tee shirts are the very worst i have ever purchased. they are so thin, very small for the size ordered and just plain cheap junk.  you get what you pay for i guess but this is really cheap clothing.
68402	nice looking. stone arrangement is beautiful. too heavy for everyday wear. came in a nice little bag with a sweet message and some candy. wow!
68484	they are thin and fit perfectly under my uniform. i am pleased with the price and will keep buying more as needed.
68498	i am an inch over six feet tall, skinny, and lank. i first ordered a large, which fit perfectly, but i was worried that it would shrink and then become a tad too short, so i order ones size up. i am glad i did, the length between the large and extra large is substantial, and if it does shrink, it will still fit perfectly. the material is mildly sheer, so you will need to layer, but it is light, super soft, and very pretty. it is fitted, but i like fitted tops. the greatest thing about this is that when i first put it on, the sleeves went past my wrists! for as tall i am, this has always been my biggest complaint when it comes to long sleeve anything for me. this shirt is a very pleasant surprise, as it is long bodied and long sleeved! one of the rare gems that will fit me exactly how i want them too without my feeling like i am some giantess in the land of small, lol. the colors are beautiful, the cut is perfect, the material is soft, i love the set-in seams, they are flattering to my figure. these are definitely for layering, however. i highly recommend ordering one size up to combat shrinking or to give extra length. you will not regret owning one of these shirts! i now have one of every color but white, and they all seem to be far higher quality than what the price suggests. if i find my large shrinks too much, i will update my review.
68506	i love this shirt dress thing, it goes to my mid thigh and it's really comfortable :) you might wanna wear something underneath cause it's a little translucent. it's great as a night gown too c:
68546	it is very cute, but the medium fit me like a large.  i then ordered it in sm, arrived just now, and it's perfect! still plenty of room to cross arms, since the back ventilation &#34;shawl&#34; is roomy--it does come down farther than most shirts like this, but seems more stylish.big plus: finally a roll-up sleeve that covers more like a 3/4 sleeve (for the m, just below the elbow for the s).  most hit above elbow and are not flattering!the &#34;fossil&#34; color is sort of like the old necco chocolate flavor wafer candy.  will not show dirt much.the &#34;button-down collar&#34; uses velcro so tips can be easily opened to lay spread out.there are two zippered pockets near the waist.  these will be fabulous for travel.  (ps i threw away one shirt--another brand--that had chest pockets.  unusable because they make you look lumpy, very unflattering, and if you tried to unbutton some top buttons, the mesh lining hung out like bad underwear.)and the &#34;columbia&#34; tag is velcro-ed so that it could hold a water tube or lip-balm.  love this shirt!
68560	i normally wear between a small and a medium.  the small fits me perfectly (i have a 34 inch bust).  it has zipper pockets - i really like having these.  the shirt has plastic snaps instead of buttons - i would prefer buttons but this is fine.  the shirt is tapered so i can get by with wearing it to work.  of the columbia shirts i have tried so far, the tamiami ii is the only style i like - mostly because of the fit.  i love this color!
68563	"you can't beat columbia for quality, innovation and wearability. these shirts have venting to let the heat out, spf 50 to keep you from sunburn, and an uncanny ability to dry almost instantly. lots of pockets, some with velcro closures. the pockets have drain holes! you can actually feel cooler wearing a light colored one with the sleeves down than being bare. amazing utility shirt for fishing, boating, kayaking or the beach, yet you can button them up, tuck them in and go to a nice place for dinner and it'll pass for a dress shirt. they wear like iron.they also make pants, some that convert into shorts, out of the same type of material. some even have swim trunk like ""undies"" in them.i'm very prone to sunburn and take medication that makes it worse. on top of that, i've had some precancerous spots on my skin that had to be removed. so, i have to be completely covered when i'm outside for any length of time. i also like to sail/kayak. baaad combo... however, with one of these shirts and a pair of the pants, i'm perfectly safe. moreover, i can be soaked to the skin and by the time i've got the yak and equipment packed up, i'm dry and ready to drive home. :-)i should explain that i'm reviewing the columbia line of clothing, both men's and women's. this particular shirt is my wife's. ;-) only thing is that they're wicked expensive. watch for closeouts and sales.my wife said to mention that the sizes by style differ wildly. watch the description of the cut (loose, form fit, etc.) and order accordingly."
68663	"they're definitely expensive for a rubber sandal. they have a slick marketing campaign that claims they'll tone your muscles as you walk, and a few wearers say they even reduce lower back pain. while some benefits apparently have been proven by laboratory tests, the prudent consumer will take these claims with a healthy dose of skepticism--""your mileage may vary."" they may not be styled to everyone's liking. most women can probably find a style and color to please them, but men are limited to just one style in two colors. but other considerations aside, fitflops are worth buying for one simple reason--they are unbelievably comfortable. you can wear them for hours and not even be aware that you have them on.if you read the other reviews, you'll find a lot of conflicting information about sizing, fit, quality, durability, etc. some reviewers say to size up; others say to size down. some say they notice a muscle toning effect; others say they don't. some say fitflops are well made and durable; others say they're junk and started falling apart immediately. i offer the following personal observations: 1) fitflops run slightly large, but not exceptionally so. if you're a half-size, i recommend sizing down. my wife normally wears a 6.5, but her size 6 walkstar fits her perfectly. 2) they are very well made, although i do wonder about the long-term durability of the very thin toe thong. the straps, sole and footbed all are made of high-quality materials, and are very well put together. 3) based on a his-and-hers sample of two pairs, they have no manufacturing defects. all in all, they seem to be of extremely high quality.if you're looking for a distinctive, lightweight, comfortable and (possibly) beneficial sandal, and don't mind paying a fairly steep price, i highly recommend that you give a pair of fitflops a try."
68729	i was looking for something that would keep my toiletries sorted and off the bathroom counter (where they end up on the floor)....this has a metal hook, like a shirt hangar, that hangs on the bathroom door hook, so its always right at hand, yet out of the way. has many pockets for your different toiletry items. zips up into a compact enough size that fits in most any size bag. only issue i have is that the zipper is a little hard to close on the corners of the bag. highly recommended travel item.
68777	i received the shoes as promised by the seller. i love these shoes. they are similar to sperry's but provide an alternative choice. everyone has sperry's, right?  a great buy.
68811	on first look, you would notice that its a fake. on the second day of wearing it, the sole chipped off. well what can you expect from a cheap product.
68815	fits like it was custom made for me.  it is knee length. the material is soft and has a little stretch.
68824	"i was told by exofficio that this shirt runs large.  i am a ""small"" large - if it runs large, generally it will be too big for me and i go down in size.  the medium in this shirt was far too small through the chest and arm so i kept the large.  i am slender/average through the chest but have larger shoulders.  i weigh #150 and am 5' 9"".  this shirt is very well designed, in many ways, but, after use, the sleeves were too short for me, even though i washed it in cool water and did not dry it in the dryer - it still shrank!! :(  i am returning the two that i bought.  if it fits you it will be great.  be careful though!  i have shirts by sportif that are similar - wonderfully designed.  i have mediums and they fit very well, even after washing.  exofficio said they will take the shirts back and give me a credit - that is very fair of them and i do appreciate the good customer service."
68858	i'm going on an extended trip abroad and i'm going to be staying in various types of places, so i decided to bring a pillow and a blanket. they weren't huge, but my suitcase was teeny so i was worried that i wouldn't have space for my clothes, much less souvenirs. if you fill the bag to capacity, you can't roll it to squeeze the air out, so be prepared to smush it aggressively. after i punched all the air out, i zipped it up and goodness gracious what a relief! 1, i hadn't destroyed the bag with my abuse and 2, its contents were easily a third of their original size. so, as long as you're not bringing just rocks, this is a great investment to shrink things down.
68966	i was looking for a small card holder that had the ability to hold lots of cards.  this is it, i have it holding at least 25 cards, drivers license, business cards, plastic cards, club cards etc.  it seems to be able to hold lots and lots if you don't use the coin purse part for money.  i love this easy access keeps the ones i use easy to get to and easy to find in my purse!  highly recommend this for people who need to find and carry cards they need to access quickly.
68992	harriton m985 vest is well made.  quality zippers on front pockets, material is heavier than expected....especially for the price. fit runs true to size.  great buy for the price.....
69055	this coat is as described in the ad. i am 5'10 weighing 160 lbs and the medium size fits me perfectly. i love it so much i am looking for the ladies version of it for my wife!
69086	i have several pairs of these backcountry shorts, and love them. i use them for hiking on vacation because they have roomy pockets and because they are crinkle material, if they get wadded up in a suitcase, no problem.  then, just about all summer i wear them at home. they are a little pricey, but they are worth it--every penny.
69108	i needed a skirt for travel so it needed to be wrinkle resistant and light weight. also, pockets were mandatory. this skirt is wonderful. it looks kind of like a hiker-girl skirt but it has the flare at the bottom and is really quite stylish. the length is nice if you travel because it's not too short for most countries and you don't look like a clueless american tourist. i am 5'5&#34;, 140-lb, and the size 6 fits very well in the waist. normally i wear an 8. the length is right at the knee. the fabric is really rich, but as one reviewer stated, it should do well in a hot and humid climate. dries quickly, and the zipper is fine to me-- as one reviewer said that it doesn't hold together exactly at the seam. i also bought the alki'i bella skirt in a size medium. love them both.
69125	i purchased this skirt to wear on casual fridays.  i was intrigued by the pockets and the a-line look of it. when i tried it on for the first time i was thrilled. i especially like the pockets, i love wearing skirts but often times miss having a spot to put things!i ended up ordering a 12, i typically wear anything from a 10-14 and am very curvy.  it is slightly loose in the waist and does hug my butt a little, but overall i am happy with how it looks, but for those of you out there who are very curvy like me, it will not fit both your hips/butt and your waist....but i think most of us are use to that by now.  i intend to take the waist in about and inch and then the fit will be just perfect.
69128	wow these are awesome. i can also wear them for exercising ( running, nordic skiing, gym) as well as just everyday office etc. so soft and comfy that i  forget i have them on - best kind to have. sized about right- maybe a tad bigger than they say.
69139	los zapatos tienen excelente acabado. por dentro son muy suaves. son de cuero y no tallan ni sacan ampollas. a pesar de ser clasicos y de verse grandes son livianos y al caminar se sienten suaves. no impactan la espalda. los recomiendo.nota: a los dos meses se empezaron a despegar en la parte del talon. me toc&oacute; mandarlos a coser y quedaron muy bien. no  es conveninete pasar por charcos de agua pues se despegan con facilidad.
69175	bought these for my husband and he loves them. i usually buy the reef brand as they seem to last him all summer and are comfortable throughout but wanted to get him something different. so far he likes these just as well. would buy again
69196	great shoes,  comfortable. stylish. young looking.  i and my daughter both like them.  will order more colors because we love them
69232	decent quality for the price, i ordered this for my wife and she is a size 12 and very curvy, it fit her great, and i believe it would fit someone quite a bit larger or smaller as well, it is very short on her (mid thigh, she is 5'6&#34;) however it would have quite bit more length on a slimmer person, still it's sexy and looks great.
69239	this was purchased because i have another fishnet dress which i really like.  the material of the dress is not the strongest, but it does have some great features - for instance it hides all the imperfections while giving the illusion of super sexy.  this makes it a nice choice for women that are harsh about their figures.  i am 6ft tall - size 16-18; the dress fit fine but was a wee bit short.  the g-string panties were a little more than dental floss.  the dress was purple and i worried about it looking cheap and tacky but the color was in fact very pretty. my husband liked it very very much...creating the desired effect i was after!
69279	"normally i'm faithfully a size 8.5 or 9 in sneakers, including normal versions of skechers.  i ordered a 9 but i could've and should've exchanged for a 9.5.  regardless of that issue, they're extremely comfortable and i'm hoping they'll give a little.edit added 08/31/09:  another thing that i have noticed with these sneakers is that i don't drag my heels, a bad habit i've always had.  i'm already looking into getting another pair so i can ""ruin"" one pair in the garden, the place i do the most walking around..."
69286	i like them they are real pretty and comfortable. i have a job where i stand in place a lot and the sole of these sneakers make it nice to stand all day. i'm not so sure about the shaping up thing thought. i wouldn't recommend these sneakers if you have a flat foot.
69310	exactly what i needed to clean and protect my uggs.  used on several pairs and still have plenty left.  great price too!
69317	these are great.  they have the stuff to pre-treat and clean.  every pair of ugg's should be married to this kit.
69335	i got this tie as a gift for myself and i love it. i have a collection of almost 100 ties, but i had to have this one since it matched a watch i ordered off of amazon. this tie can be used with a variety of color combinations. it's well made, and looks great with or without a suit.
69370	i purchased 2 of these, so i could spread a little gold out over my bracelet.  nowdays, it is impossible for me to afford real gold beads, and these beads give me the gold look, without the hefty price.they are not solid gold.  they are sterling coated in 14k gold.  the gold is a nice yellow gold, bright and shiny!i would recommend them to someone like me who wants a mix of silver and gold on their european type bracelets.
69389	i have never enjoyed wearing bras, in the 15 years that i have been wearing them. for most of my life i've worn sports bras, and even gone bra free. well now after two children i can barely go bra free in my house, and i still hate wearing bras. i absolutely cannot do underwire. this is the best wire free bra! i've found that a lot of wire free bras fold underneath the boobs, this is the only underwire bra, not resembling a training bra or sports bra that does not do that. it is so comfortable and holds my boobs up so nicely. the straps are not adjustable!! but it still works for me (and i'm 5'3). i bought 1 at t.j. maxx and just about lived in it, i'd wash it and wait til it was dry so i could put it back on. i found another one on sale in a department store and bought it. now i am on here buying my third because i really hate having to wear any bra but this one.
69397	i love the softness and comfort of this invisible bliss wire-free bra; i find it a little tight but am losing weight so that might help.
69418	my usual cup size is a dd. this bra fit very snug...and has a minimizing effect even though the description doesn't mention it.otherwise very comfy and nice. the side panels keep things front and center instead of sliding off to the sides.
69566	it's oakley...what more can i say?  great fit, clear vision and very sturdy and stylish. this is my second pair; the other lasted for 14 years, so it's well worth the money.  besides, these are polarized, which is very good for your eyes so it's well worth the cost.  nothing can screw up your eyes like cheapo lens.
69587	the picture shows a red hoodie, but the text called it &#34;royal blue.&#34; since either was acceptable i placed the order. royal blue came insteadthe hoodie fits well, and is comfortable and husband is happy.
69592	"it's a good fleece. not that thick, but still ok. it has long sleeves and that's a good thing. it's made in mexico and i don't know if that is a good or bad think, but i know i'm satisfied. ""please write at least 20 words describing your experience with this item. repeated words don't count."" amazon :)"
69604	this is a beautiful crucifix necklace and the chain is beautiful as well and is a longer length then most.  it looks more expensive then it is and i have personally decided to wear it only to mass on sundays or for special occasions.  highly recommend it for any one looking for a quality crucifix necklace at a very reasonable cost.
69615	i'm a 34d, and this did not work for me at all!  padding was too thick, and it is not full coverage.  i stuck out everywhere!  i would not classify this as a full-coverage bra.
69626	these fitflops are a cut above the original thanks to the new, more solid top band, and the microfiber lining. just like the original, they are so comfortable, you won't want to wear any other shoe this summer. i love fitflops so much that i have them in various colors now. do order a size down. this top strap is a little more snug, so you might want to be a little more conservative, especially if you have a high instep. i wear a 6 1/2, and went down to 6, which was perfect. ordinarily, the manufacturer would tell me to go all the way down to 5.get ready for the best walking experience of your life. these sandals really do work.
69814	"i have 1 in every color. these are so comfy & cute! a bit longer than typical bermuda shorts but shorter than capris. lightweight & breathable material doesn't bag out or shrink. plenty of pockets & ties at legs & waist for adjustability. prana quality. pricey but worth it.the fit is very accurate with typical sizing. and the fit is universal over all the colors.it would be 5 stars except these are sold description wise as being 15.5"" inseam. even at the biggest size, they are not this long. i wear a size 4 & that size has a 13"" inseam. i was slightly disappointed in the incorrect description prana has on these no matter where you buy them. on the sizing chart, they are listed correctly though. it is just the general description that is incorrect."
69815	i'm a curvy size 12 and these pants look great and are super comfortable.  they are cooler than capris and more versatile than shorts.  i was surprised to find that even with the pockets they are also quite flattering.  haven't had them long enough to address wear and tear, but i'm giving them a 5 for fit, comfort, and style.
69845	these things are so cool, and they actually stay on (if i'm wearing tight clothes). i have this backless dress that i can't wear a bra with and these were really effective in covering me up. plus, i barely notice they're even there.
69853	of this kind of product.  the others were only a couple dollars each.i thought maybe the better brand would work, but you can still see the outline of them with my wedding dress.
69855	since i'm a big chested woman, i don't like to wear padded bras as they don't fit well.  these are the perfect solution.  they adhere easily, stay on all day and are so comfortable i forget i'm wearing them.  even though my bra has no padding and my blouses are light weight, you can't see a line of any kind.  these are exactly what i hoped for in feeling 100% comfortable knowing if it gets cold, no one can tell. :-)  perfect product!
69969	with so much variance in sizes, it was nice to get a medium on a first try.  not a super large small, or a small large, but a medium medium.  snug but not tight, not overly long.  caution: dont judge size until you wash it.  it shortens up massively.  i love the fit of this shirt in medium (5-11, 165 athletic shoulders), the only drawback is that it is slightly thicker than the average shirt (and thus warmer).  a better shirt for fall/winter.  and yes, the neck plunges lower than the nauticas which make it look better if you open your collar.
70036	the hanes comfort soft briefs i got at walmart had a much too thin crotch. my junk would fall out of the sides. these are the opposite. there is much too much room in the front crotch so it's very unsupportive.they're also kind of ugly.i recommend these hilfigers:b005ofltjc
70139	ecco almost always hits it out of the park with good looking shoes that are comfortable and allow room for orthotics. they are stylish and lightweight. well made and durable.  this is my 3rd pair of ecco dress shoe and i also have 3 pairs of echo cross trainers.
70227	nipple show through?on a cold day - can be seen - more than expected.fabric?very stretchy.compression?yes but no support(lift). you'll be flatter but not lifted.bounce-o-meter?definite bounce.  men will love to watch this bra.running in it?not a chance and i'm only 34b.quality?high, as expected.sizing?medium fit me fine at 34 b - 125 pounds - small was impossibly small.comfortable?pretty much.as it appears?pretty much.keeping it?yeah, but don't think i'll order more.last wish?wish it came in skin tones so i could wear it as an everyday bra.it's good for that.advice?most will like it, some will love it. i thought it was just ok.how about me?you'll have to try it for yourself.
70276	not leather, but for the dollars spent, it did look good for a few wearings.  not a high quality belt.
70312	seriously fasting shipping ever! i pressed send and i nearly tripped on the package, maybe the distributor lives on my street?this is a gorgeous duffel bag and it looks even better in person, it looks expensive but it is so reasonable.
70339	these are the best things to have  in the fall/winter. i hate lugging around ear muffs but living in the windy city during the cold causes me really bad headaches when that wind hits my ears. i can easily just pop these on and when i go inside slip them in my pocket.
70349	i love these.  this is the second pair i've owned as i somehow lost the first.  i don't like having a band on top of my head as like traditional ear muffs and the behind the head kind slips off easily.  my hair is easily frizzed so i don't like wearing hats.  earbags are the perfect solution.
70364	i'm using these to wrap my extension cords (i'm a dj) so these things are perfect for what i use them for.  you could use them as a temporary belt or whatever needs to be wrapped.  perfect price point too.
70405	i have a hard time with my high arches and shoes that are big enough, wide toe bed and size 10 to 11 depending on the brand.. these slides feel so comforatble.
70448	as much as i hate to say it, especially after the money i spent, but i wish i'd chosen a different style.  these are great for plowing through snow without even so much as blinking an eye. i like that the tongue and shaft are all one piece and the adjustability of laces is a godsend for a chunky chick like me. the snaps that hold in the liner are obviously not very rugged and definitely not meant to pull the boot on, so i'm being careful with them.overall they're tolerable for a couple of hours at a time. but after a while, there is a very distinct and pretty uncomfortable rub on the back of my right leg where the leather buckles. i'm not sure if time and leather conditioner could possibly help but it's frustrating since i'd prefer to wear them without having to think through my day, where i'll be and how long i'll be on my feet.positives:absolutely weatherproof and very toasty insidegood lookingdurable constructiondrawbacks:the leather on the back of the heel and up to the calf buckles inward, making for an unbelievably uncomfortable rub, even through tucked in jeans and over heavy socksheavy, clunky, stiff so they make walking more awkwardno arch supportgrip is nothing special
70462	i have these in brown.  they are so comfortable.  i have tarsal tunnel syndrome and have had surgery that only half worked, and these shoes, amazingly, do not irritate the nerve in my foot.  my friend has some, and she said she had balance problems at first, but strangely, although my balance is awful, i actually feel more stable in these shoes.  i'm not sure why that is, but i sure am glad.  to me they feel more like walking barefoot than a lot of shoes, and that is how i walk best.i could tell after the first day that they seemed to be exercising my lower calves a bit, and my husband commented that i was standing up taller.  my friend says she can't tell a difference in her posture, but i have noticed - they obviously have helped mine.the shoes look very nice on.  the strap is velcro and it stays on very well.  i also have been wearing these out in my garden a bit, without thinking, and they've been easy to keep clean.  i got dirt and water on them the other day, but it brushed off and i can't even tell. whew.  they were high and i was scared i'd ruined them, but nope, they cleaned up great.my only complaint is that they are a bit hot.  i've been using foot spray to keep them from getting stinky, because the are rather hot to me and i don't think they'd look right with socks.i personally find them more comfortable than crocs.
70496	"i'm 5'3, 150, 38b. i have a round bum, curvy hips, a little belly (from having a baby), smaller chest and slightly broader shoulders. i ordered a medium, color black and it fits like a glove. this dress is a ""stretchy"" material with no lining. it clings and is sort of a spandexy feeling material, only in a flattering way. it doesn't seem to ride up when you're walking, but the top could probably slide down. the neckline has no grippy edge so you must rely on a good pushup bra to hold it up and enhance your chest and maybe even some double stick fashion tape to help keep it in place all evening. the rouching around the midsection is absolutely flattering to someone with some love handles and a little belly. however, below the waste and around your bum is pretty snug so be aware that a very lumpy bum will be noticeable. if you tug and pull at this dress to hard you will hear little threads tear within the rouching. be sure not to just yank on the dress when pulling it down. the length is pretty long, but you can easily pull it up a little around the rouching/belly to adjust the total length and make it shorter at the bottom. i don't see any need to have it hemmed even though i'm very short. the higher your heels the better though. pros: totally sexy, but not trashy, flatters an imperfect belly and hips, cons: there's a ""seam"" around the waist line where the rouching ends and the flowing bottom starts. this seam goes around your bum, depending how far down you pull the dress, so the seam bothers me, but it's definitely not a deal breaker! my husband is probably going to drool when he see's me in it for a black tie event we're attending in a few weeks."
70524	i used this to store a few papers so i assumed any cheap case would do the job as quality would not matter. i assumed it would last a very long time considering the case would be left untouched on a desk. apparently, the case broke without any physical contact!!!the latch actually snapped in half and flew off. the force from the spring actually broke the latch... this has got to be one of the cheapest things ever made. an object that breaks itself without contact... what a waste of money.
70554	i have always admired the baby lupah invicta watches because they looked very pretty and elegant.  i love the silver tilt of the softly rounded watch glass. unfortunately, it is one of those pretty but useless touches.  when you see a picture of it, the numbers are very clear; however while in use, the watch always has to be tilted one way or another to see the numbers.  this watch is good if you only want it to be pretty and you're going to look at your phone for the time anyway.it's not that big of a problem to tilt the watch to see the time since the watch is always traveling and you already have to bring it around to the front to see the watch face anyway.  that's the really annoying part about it.  most of the time i am wearing it, the actual watch face is on the outside of my wrist, where it is most likely to get banged up.  on the other hand, so to speak, no amount of banging has caused the watch to get scratched or to go off time.i have been wearing this watch since the day it arrived trying to make it be more flexible.  it has been everywhere during the past two months even to a 7-year-old's laser tag birthday party where it was covered with chocolate frosting and cake.  it has never become softer and more flexible.  the inside of the band is sort of sueded so it is more comfortable.  but then it has the ring of scratchy and annoying leather to catch the end of the band.because watch bands have never fit me, i have tended to like big dangly watches or stretchy bracelet watches.  my wrist is very small and bands are loose.  to put a new hole in it is to make it fit so closely that it cuts off circulation.  i have never been able to find the right in-between notch that will allow it to stay face up on my wrist and not cut off circulation or to be comfortably loose but not floating all over the place.of all of the invicta watches i have tried, this one is the most problematic.  well, actually, it's the only problematic one.
70576	i would recommend this watch to any one that has trouble seeing the numbers here they are easy to see, and is a nice watch.
70605	nice design, i liked it for the three weeks it held together. then the carry handle ripped right out of the mounting point. the leather at the mounting point was tissue-paper thin.i'm quite disappointed to have to return it.. it was bought on design, not price, so the poor quality is an annoyance, to say the least.
70608	this is a great bag for traveling.  i bought it for a cruise and it was able to hold everything i needed to take.  it is quite large, but not bulky.  i like that there are many different compartments to keep items sorted and easy to get to when needed.  the workmanship is excellent and you can really smell the leather.  the price was also great.  i will use this bag on a daily basis for work, as well.
70630	this is the perfect size for me. i wanted a small purse for travel that would fit in my large size carry on travel purse. (in addition to carry on luggage) once at my destination, i can be ready to go see the sights immediately, just pull the purse out of my larger bag. i have all of the essentials. love the multiple divided zip areas. phone, small camera, reading glasses, lip balm, tissues, medications, id's and cards (inside zip pocket) i do not use the card holders, i like my cards altogether in an rfid case. i added small split rings to the zipper pulls then connected them with a tiny carabiner, for additional security as it is my &#34;travel&#34; purse.
70640	i purchased this bag to be something to carry &#34;just the essentials&#34; it works very well for that. i am very satisfied with this bag and would consider purchasing a different color for other occasions.
70669	i ordered this to help my posture and give me support during horseback riding.  i am very happy with the product quality and fit.  i ordered a 36c (same size as my victoria secret body bra) and it fit well.
70671	this bra is amazingly comfortable. nothing scratchy or pokey. no weird lines showing through my shirt or anything. the only reason i am not giving it 5 stars is a matter of personal preference. i do wish it had less of a minimizing effect on my bust. but i know a lot of women with larger cup sizes like mine are all about minimizing as well. either way i think that every one who wants to improve their posture should try this out.
70686	good shorts for the price, good for working around the house and running to the grocery store.
70790	"i'm a 34d, and the 34 fit the top part fit me really well.  someone with smaller breasts might find that part too big. the product was well made, and the red fabric was very pretty.  however, i have wider hips and this was extremely unflattering, so for that reason i sent it back. also this might be problematic for someone who is tall with a longer torso if you want to put the stockings with it too.  i'm 5'9"" and it just did not come as far down on me as the model."
70796	very cheap, but they look nice. they are dainty- perfect for me as a woman wearing links. some men might find them a bit small.
70799	i like them and i was really excited about them because i thought this would be really cool. i kinda expected them to be a bit bigger because of the hour class part but they're kind of small. i still like them and i am giving them as a gift. they come in a beautiful pink box with a ribbon.
70818	nice idea, but the bra was very much too small.  i measured my band size with fabric measuring tape 3 times and my measure is not wrong, the band size was not what is said.
70847	i don't know how to review underwear. they hold everything in place and do it in style. i bought several pairs of these and wear them to the gym. no complaints.
70848	this luxury underwear line looks and feels real nice, and is true to size.  the only problem is, you cannot put them in the dryer.  they will shrink and suffocate your balls.  don't say i didn't warn you!!!  other than that, they are pretty decent.  i also like the way they make my junk look.  my girl can't keep her hands off me, when i wear them.
70895	we all are in allentow school inpa the s&h is enough for 1 shirt i donot want to order with this i will order esle where
70920	i love these. they are great for nipple coverage. (not recommended for sheer shirts or really really tight thin materialed shirts) i've used them many times, washed them many times as well. i wash with warm water and use my gentle cetiphel face wash and stills sticks beautifully. totally worth the money if you ask me. it may not work with everything, but works with most things. i will be purchasing another, but the one i have works so great, i got a little time.***** had this set since july 2010 and buying a new set june 2011, yes totally worth it!
70928	in bras, i typically wear a c or d/dd cup, depending on manufacturer/brand, and am thrilled that these work so well for me. this is all i ever wear now, with regard to an everyday bra, so am au naturale except when exercising. i love not having bra lines, and have plenty of support if needed when wearing them with sports tops (with built in bra) when i run. i'm training for a marathon, so also wanted something like nippies to keep from getting nipple burn related to incorrect clothing/ long mileage. i have never had the least bit of chafing or irritation related to the adhesive and wear them all day long under scrubs at work. that being said, i do notice a slight prominence related to their use and would not want to wear a tight-fitting, form hugging top with it since that would be noticeable. based on reading all of the reviews before finally purchasing and now with my own experience to offer, i'm thinking this is more commonly due to use of nippies on larger breasted women. i had worn dimrs for years (non-adhesive) inside my bra for &#34;nipple control&#34; and was happy with them, but these cover a wider area and seem to offer support as well as nice shaping to my breasts, partly due to the larger size. i could never go bra less unless i had a form fitting tank top over them. nippies with adhesive are freeing! i have purchased another box to have when these wear out, but after daily use for 1.5 mos., they are still going strong. i take care of them as directed. fantastic purchase!!
70941	like many of the other reviewers, i bought this bow tie for a doctor who costume. the quality is good and the product is durable. not too big, not too small. the color is exactly as shown: a rich burgundy. classy and stylish. it's great!
70962	i love these flip-flops sooo much.  this is my third pair because my puppy chewed through two others.  they fit so well (aren't too wide for my slightly narrow feet) and they are very comfortable.  they also feel a little dressier so i can wear them all day and also out to dinner with white jeans.
71022	i have difficulty finding sandals with good arch supports, that fit well and are very comfortable. the keen whisper sandal meets all the criteria for me. my orthopedic surgeon- rheumatologist commented on how much he liked them for supporting my feet and style!  not bad! i plan to buy more of this style in a variety of colors. no more grandma shoes for me! only keen! every time i wear them people stop and say how sharp they are, ask what the name brand is and where i purchased them.
71054	this is my third pair of keen whisper sandal's.  comfortable as always, wear them all summer long and into the fall and spring. i can't wear all keen shoes because i have a very narrow foot but these can really be adjusted and readjusted as needed.
71058	i have a very wide foot, and these shoes are great!  when they get dirty, throw in the washing machine (but not the dryer) and they come out looking like new.  the elastic lacing allows you to adjust and get a custom fit for your foot.  i wear both in the summer and winter (adding a color coordinated sock, so i don't look too much like a dork).  you can walk miles and miles in these and the support is fantastic.
71075	color is great and the fit is as expected.  only obstacle for me is the lack of arch support.  i have very high arches, so i need shoes with substantial arch support.  these shoes don't have that, but they're decent shoes regardless.  i just can't wear them for as long as i can wear my other shoes.
71105	i read another review and dismissed it, well they were right these shoes are sized about a half size bigger than your regular shoe size.  i first bought an 8 as that's what i wear and they were big..  i plan on a lot of walking in these this winter on both easter island and in the galapogus islands and floppy would be dangerous.  i repurchased in a size 71/2 ,a  little hard to put on but they feel like they were made for me, support, not tight but snug as in i could do many things and these would not slip off and with the tread on the bottom would be great for climbing around on rocks and walking beaches.  i will report back around christmas
71125	i just love keen sandals.  i no longer have foot pain and after a long day my feet feel refreshed.  i just bought a pair for my daughter, one for my husband and another pair for myself!
71144	i purchased these rain pants along with the jacket...they arrived in time for the outing and they fit great...kept me dry and comfortable...would highly recommend...
71145	there is an inner coin pocket but i would like side seam pockets but so far i'm happy with the pants and fit. we don't have snow much here so they are wind pants and maybe rain pants. well constructed. i got a large and it fit like a 12. i am mature, 132#, 5-4 if that gives you a clue.
71179	when i opened the package i was overwhelmed by the strange stench plus it was not what i was hoping for. the smell was so bad that my wife had to wash it twice. and still the smell was there.
71181	i love these scarves. they may not be the best quality out there, but i purchased them knowing that, and was very surprised when i opened them and found that they far exceeded my expectations. i am wearing one right now and it (or a different color) will be a part of my daily attire.
71187	i love these shorts.they are light weight and fit me very well.the material dries quickly and does not cling to your skin.the inseam is 6&#34;, which i prefer over knee length.overall......a great buy!!i bought 4 in various colors.
71268	size chart seemed to be off.  my daughter is 35 months and 28 lbs.  this was way too tight for her.
71311	i like keens, but not this style.  it was very wide and stiff and uncomfortable.  i returned the next day...
71339	i like these sunglasses very much. i am outside a lot, running, hiking, etc., and am pretty rough on sunglasses. bought a pair a few years ago that got broken in an auto accident, but that's all that was broken, and it was a fairly bad accident. i tried others that are sold in grocery or drug stores, but they do not hold up at all. so far, so good with these. worth the extra cost.
71341	the presentation of the product did not seem the best, the product did not bring even a protective case, much to be desired in that respect, i have received a polyethylene, would have to improve.
71351	for the price u cant ask for much, it looks cool, fits perfectly well for me. stylish & sturdy. cant ask for much.
71399	i bought this watch after shopping around for a new g shock. it looked cool online. i got it out of the box & hated it instantly. tmi (too much information).. there are fish, moon, temp, date & an analog clock that blocks most of the digital dispay. needless to say, i returned it within 15 mins. of owning it.
71423	easy to set.  very reasonably priced for a watch with five alarms.  this is the watch i depend on to get me up in the morning since my alarm clock broke.  also attractive with blue/purple accent color with the black.
71426	i do like invicta's watches, for they are on the larger size and tend to be statement fashion peices.  but this one is quite thick and almost clumsy when you wear it. the watch face is very thick and heavy, so it wants to roll down on your wrist.  i had to have the band made smaller so that a little tighter fit would stop it from rolling around my wrist.  but although i like the square face, i was suprised at how deep or thick the face of the watch was.  a little awkward when you are wearing it.  but for the sale price, i am happy with another invicta to add to my collection.  they tend to be rugged, daily wear type of watches for me.
71442	the watch was smaller than expected.according to the reviews i expected it to be gigantic.it perfect,really,in size.the bracelet was huge,big enough to slide completely over my hand closed.so i had to have 5 links removed.i had an incredibly hard time finding anyone who would touch this watch.everyone refused to size it.i finally,on a second attempt,got jared's to do it for me.i highly suggest not sizing to exact size.for one its very heavy.it will make the watch feel tighter as the weight pulls on it.plus with the design of the clasp,you must be able to get fingers under the band to unclasp it.the trick is to pull the clasp sides up and away from the wrist and latch.put a thumb on top,a finger under and pull away.the diamond are pretty much non exsistant,that wasnt an exageration by far.there are 16 teeny .005-.0025 diamonds that only total about .04 carats.they are very difficult to see even when looking for them and should have been left off.and the border in which they are set is darker,like sterling silver with aged patina.i do like it and surely think its worth the price.it looks good and i think once i add a link back ill be good to go.i havent taken the time to set the date yet because everything else was set,so im not sure about the ease of it.oh,and it took forever to receive...
71525	the vendor is excellent. received this belt soon after placing the order. have been wearing it regularly, replacing other belts in my closet. i like the width. i like the material. size is right.  the price is right. could have easily gone 5*. i recommend the belt and the vendor. thank you.
71541	this shoe was described as very comfortable but for my feet they were not.i think at this point its more a matter of my feet only tolerating a wedge. i had to return.but they are a cute shoe.
71607	this sock is so tight. i ordered a medium for my kids who wear a youth size 3 shoe. they are 6 yrs old. this size should be plenty big, but it's so tight you can barely get their feet in them, plus they are super tight around the ankles and this can't be comfortable. my children are all average size on the growth charts, so i know it's not their issue, it's the socks.  i expect after they are washed (c'mon who washes socks in cold water as the maker instructs?) these will fit toddlers.  they are also not seamless.  the seams are smooth and tighter than say, hanes, but still there.again, these look and feel really nice, but what's the point if they don't fit and you can't bleach em and wash em on hot?
71655	i purchased these around the first of february. the looked and fit well. well around the end of march, i made a boo boo and spilled some motor oil on the whole toe front of one of the shoes. i cleaned them the best i could blotting out as much oil as i could and then i put both shoes in the washing machine. i did not expect the stain to come out but was hoping for the best. well when the shoes dried i found that the shoe without the oil looked fine, but the other shoe with the oil was dark on the toe (which i expected) but the rest of it took on a whitish color and the stitching came loose in a spot near the ankle. now i expected the dark area on the toe but one whitish shoe and on brown shoe was not going to look right.i called nb and told them i realized the oil was my fault but the white discoloration and stitching problem was something else entirely and was there something i could do. they told me they did not recommend washing them (though i have for years) i was surprised when they asked me to return the shoes and they sent out a replacement for me. i am used to paying a little more for the nb brand, and will keep on supporting them as long as their customer service is as good as i discovered they were.
71664	i bought these for my daughter.  they came quickly and fit her perfectly.  she loves pink, so these were a great buy.
71738	why this thing has a 4.5 star rating is beyond me. it's junk. i've used all kinds of money clips and wallets over the years. this particular one isn't on the bottom of my list, but it's close. go with the ralph lauren polo leather card / cash holder. they cost 50 bucks, and they're worth every cent as they last for years. whatever you do, do yourself a favor and don't buy this &#34;smart money clip&#34;.
71770	i read almost every review before purchasing these fantastic boots. they are exactly what i hoped for. i purchased my exact size and they fit perfectly. i have larger calves for my size, so i am always a little hesitant in ordering taller boots. no worries, these tevas have plenty of room.  they have no insallation, they're stylish but not purchased for warm winter boots. these tevas are very well made and my docs now have a competitor in long lasting. i went with the standard shipping and received them much sooner than expected. however, i wasn't very happy they were just left on my porch. over all i am super satisfied with my purchase.
71792	the strap on this watch is too long for my wrist.  it's not like i am fragil or thin boned so i don't understand why they have to make watches with a strap that could fit around my calf.
71802	i returned it because it was way too large for a lady.  of course it is a men's watch, but i thought i would give it a try.  too big.
71817	i purchased this exact watch 3 years ago and it was still working perfectly (not even a new battery!) until i lost it on vacation, so i am back for another one. i am a teacher so i need a easy to read digital watch that still looked somewhat professional.  this was one of the few watches that is small and simple looking.  a background light would be nice but for the price and size, it's not a deal breaker for me since in 3 years i have maybe only wished i had it a handful of times.  my watch took a lot of beating (being banged into desks, used in the shower and while working out) and barely had a scratch on it. it has an alarm, can beep on the hour (if set), and a timer. i liked that i could start the timer, flip back to the clock, and the timer would keep running.  i highly recommend this watch if you need something that is simple, no-frills, yet attractive.
71847	this bra fits me perfectly!  it functions as the perfect t-shirt bra, with no visible lines.  and yet it has a little lace for added interest and beauty.  i absolutely love it and bought this brand/style in 4 different colors.  in fact, i will probably buy even more!
71854	i got these along with three hanes beefy-ts (with pockets). i wore one of the fruit of the looms xls today, washed it this afternoon, and now i have a medium! these are certainly not pre-shrunk like the hanes, and the question is whether i should have gotten an xxl, but one can never be sure what size it will end up as.we're donating two pair to charity, and i just ordered three more hanes. what we saved by buying these disappeared in the wash. i should have known.
71866	i was just looking for some t shirts to wear around the house, but i found that these t shirts are of decent quality so i wear them just about any place i go!( depending). but yea, they fit pretty good and seem to be holding up pretty good so far. for the price, i recommend these!
71894	i have worn leather money belts for years, but they tend to be stiff and uncomfortable. this one fits well, stays on tight, looks good, and is more flexible and comfortable for 19 hour plane flights. fours stacks of bills will fit in lengthwise, with 6 or 7 bills in each stack (depends on the paper thickness) folding into 3rds along the bill length. like all belts it takes a bit of finesse to get the bills in and zip it shut, but not very hard to do. since the belt itself is flexible it can then be &#34;molded&#34; around your waist for a near invisible fit, unlike leather belts. very well made as expected from pacsafe. overall the best money belt i have ever purchased! recommended!use only for large bills you will not need very often. like all money belts, getting money out as needed is not the easiest thing to do. after all, it is a belt, not a wallet!
71918	"i have this kipling alvar crossbody in a metallic blue with black trim & a black cotton/web shoulder strap.  the measurements as shown in the description are correct - 0.5d x 11w x 9.5h inches - so make sure to measure to see if the purse suits your needs. if you overfill this purse, it will look like a big fat lump.the interior will hold a big wallet, thin checkbook and some writing utensils.  the front zipper pockets are best for small, flat things like notes, thin checkbook, business cards, and/or a pen.the purse itself is a nice, casual looking purse (the shoulder strap makes the purse fit squarely in the casual description) that can be used as an everyday purse.  it has a ""different"" enough look to make it stand out and look trendy but still subdued enough to go with a wide wardrobe."
71947	"this fits me well.  i wear a 3x tall, mainly because i have a 56"" chest and i'm just shy of 6'2"" tall. that size fits perfectly.  it is soft to the touch, although somewhat thin. it is more of a moderately cold jacket. i would not recommend relying on it in below 0 weather.the zipper seems to be in good shape so far. it was the first thing i messed with after reading reviews of some people getting stuck with a broken, or poorly installed zipper.  mine seems just fine, at least so far.the two pockets on the sides also have zippers which i was suprised in a good way about.  i typically like to keep my wallet in my jacket pocket, and a zipper will help reassure me that it hasn't fallen out.overall for 35 dollars i would recommend one of these if you need a light jacket.  i would warn against getting a darker color if you have any long haired animals; it'll collect lots of hair and you'll look like a yeti."
71953	i actually loved the shoes; however, the size (6) runs small so i wanted to return and exchange them for a half size larger.  i found out the only returns you can get from this company is a refund.  no exchanges. that's why a 2-star rating.  it's more for the company than the shoes.  i was very disappointed.  of course, i could re-order them i suppose but don't think i will.
72013	it looks little bulky, also i read reviews there were said it is little bigger than true size, but it was not.  so if you going to buy this shoes you must follow your size.
72064	works great for a gym bag. holds one set of clothing, shoes and socks. not too big and bulky like my adidas bag. just right for me.
72068	this is the perfect size for the gym or the pool. i hate lugging around huge bags! i am not disappointed at all.
72069	i've had this bag for years.  i take it to the gym and smash it in lockers.  i take it fishing or to the beach and toss it around.  for such a low price, this is one great bag.  and, it still looks almost new.
72112	i love this bra!  it is very well made and comfortable to wear.  it supports my back, as well as eliminating my midriff bulges.  the styling is very sexy.  overall, i will buy another.  rago rocks!
72147	these items came with one of the earpieces is already bent out crooked, the lenses are hazy even after trying to clean them, and i feel like i might break them just putting them on my face.
72155	i would have to go up one or 2 sizes to get the band to fit.  i was quite disappointed.  i had ordered other brands the same time and this one was the worst for fit.  the bra was as described, but the band is way too small.  don't know how they measure, but it sure isn't my measurement.
72193	for the price you can't go wrong. comfortable with just the right amount of padding. good buy if you're looking for all day wear in comfort.
72251	"i bought these same shoes else where (only place that would put them on sale for less than 99.00).cons: they are pricey for stay at home mom, but got them finally on sale. have had 4 weeks. wear daily around house and errands. power walk 4-6 days a week (outside and on a treadmill). daughter likes to take shortcut through woods on walks an these shoes are not good on uneven ground. i can't walk fast then because twisting an ankle in woods would be very easy (i know their not meant for over terran hiking). once to more stable ground they're great.after first week, the right shoe feels like something is adding pressure in a line on the sole (metatarsal part of foot). it starts to really hurt an burn after 30 of power walking. i've not read any other complaints about this. my assumption is that where the soles are glued together someone got a little heavy with the glue line or something. it feels like i'm walking with a shoe lace stuck under my foot. could be just this pair of shoes defect.size was bit small. my normal is 7 1/2 to 8 in tennis shoes. the 8 was touching my toes just enough that i knew for power walking they'd hurt. got the 8 1/2 even though they feel slighty to big, but i like to wear 2 pair of socks to prevent blisters. put with this also the heal slips some because they don't fit my heel as good.pros: works muscles not usually used. they have helped defined my calf muscles (not something i really needed more of, but muscle is muscle an burns more calories). unless your in shape, i wouldn't recommend doing lots of walking in them right off. i can feel it in my glutes an thighs, but not as much.i have a herniated disc so the extra shock cushioning is very nice.they do add spring to your step. it does feel better than shoes i've used with gel or air cushioning.the extra 2"" of height. i wear my long jeans over them an you don't even notice that they're a platform shoe.very comfortable to wear all day, especially for hospital or clinic (cement) floors.over all, i'm seriously thinking of saving for another pair."
72285	bought these a while ago for the mrs - she hated them.  made her feel uneven and ended up returning them during the recall thing.
72313	i ordered the blue in m size and it fits perfectly, looks elegant and sexy. the size runs small, so be sure to order one size up to be in the safe side
72342	maybe this was the first keens product? disappointingly thin, soft, unstable sole. okay i know they are called floppies, but being keens i expected amore substantial sole. maybe its my aversion to spraining an ankle, but these did not have the support i expected. so sad.i need some new keens!
72388	i bought this belt for my husband. it looked good, but it came without directions. neither one of us could figure out how to open or close the belt, so i returned it for a refund.
72407	these bras fit on the last set of hooks, so if i should lose weight (miracles happen every day), i can keep wearing them. they have good side coverage and are for light to medium levels of exercise. i'm a fast walker, so they will work well for me. i find the top of the bra between my breasts sticks out a bit when i sit, but i am extremely short waisted, so this is not uncommon. i find them to be extremely comfortable for summer, as there is no real padding on them. something to consider if one is in an air conditioned room. the majority of the support comes from the infrastructure of the bra, but i don't find the extra underwire to be a bad thing in this instance. sometimes, underwire is uncomfortable, but not this time.
72466	1. shipped pretty quickly2. colour has a little more grey than i expected but that's okay3. the built in bra was a little smaller compared to other tanks with built in bras that i've bought4. very comfortable and the straps don't dig into your skin like other tanks do! (i say this because i'm a bit busty)5. overall i would buy from the seller again
72492	says x large, but is not fits funny under the arms not real happy with it guess i will give it away
72505	some time ago i have sworn that i will only use solar-powered watches that synchronize time with atomic clocks. initially only quite expensive and 'stylish' models were available, but wearing a timepiece worth several hundred bucks while doing work around the house makes you constantly worried that you scratch precious thing.this watch is under $100 and has all the benefits of its more expensive 'brothers':- solar powered quite efficiently - with normal daily exposure to light i'm always at the 'max charge' level (of course living in sunny nevada helps here).- time synchronization with the 5 radio transmitters all over the world (usa, england, germany, japan*2). i frequently travel to visit family in europe, so usa and england/germany transmitter sync is important to me. many watches in the us only sync with usa transmitter or usa and japan; the latest models just started supporting new china transmitters; this one is the perfect balance for me.- time signal reception is excellent in nevada, bot inside the buildings and outside. from my previous experiences it should mean good reception throughout the west coast and (maybe!) some problems inside solid-construction buildings in new england and florida.- unlike some cheap models of watches and clocks, this one reads daylight savings time data straight from the radio signal, so it 'springs ahead' and 'falls back' at the correct dates. some older clocks have hard-coded dst transition dates and are confused after the recent dst changes in the usa.- i love 'auto el' feature: the watch turns on electro-luminescent backlight for two seconds when it is dark and the wearer positions hand appropriately. perfect for the movies, night flights and similar situations.- i usually prefer metal bands, but resin band in this model is surprisingly good quality and wears ok.- button operation seems to be reliable so far.- the glass is scratch resistant and placed recessed in the metal panel - so far i managed to keep it clear, which is unusual for me.amazon had the best price for this item, better than fry's and casio website. the watch arrived on time and in good shape.
72560	ordered this for my husband for valentine's day as he had been looking for a great pair of tac pants. he loves these. he had several other pairs, but has made mention that none of the others compare to these. the most notable features are the quality material and the diamond gusseted crotch. he goes hiking often and has fallen but the pants have never ripped. his other pants also have gusseted crotches, but the diamond gusset on these ones allow for a larger range of motion.amazon's delivery time on this product was incorrect. i contacted the seller to change the color of these pants before they even received the order from amazon. they changed the color for me immediately and i received them in two days - muuuuuch faster than expected.overall i highly recommend the pants and this seller for future tactical gear purchases.
72563	i'm going to el salvador this summer.  and will be hiking around the hills and mountains, looking at coffee plants.  i was looking for a pair of pants that looks good (check- i like the style of these pants.  there are lots of pockets but that is not the main thing you notice), that are cut for larger guys (check- i weigh over 230 pounds and do p90x.  i have big legs.  buying these online made me a little nervous.  i have very little luck picking pants off the shelf and having the first pair fit.  usually my legs are to tight.  others who have complained about the baggy fit, gave me hope that these would work for me.  and they fit great) and are water proof as i will be out in the rain and pushing through a lot of undergrowth (check- i poured water on these, and it just rolled right off.  then i made a depression in the material and poured 1/3 cup of water in the depression.  i let it sit for about 45 minutes.  poured the water off, and the fabric was totally dry.  score).  overall i am very impressed.  but- just know that these are cut a little large in the legs, with that in mind you cannot go wrong.
72568	if we were only talking function, these pants would win hands down over all other tactical pants (with two exceptions - i'll get there). positioning is great, zippers are perfect, mostly well thought out design.  if was going back overseas, these would be in my bag.problem is, they fit horribly.  you'll see a few reviews about the mc hammer effect, and the &#34;load in the pants&#34; effect.  yeah, it's true.  i get having some extra room - you want that.  but this is ridiculous.  and it appears to only be in the seat.  the legs, though roomy, are appropriately so.  the seat?  dear god.the other issue is the size/gusset of the front cell phone/mag pockets.  there small (i.e., iphone 5 with case won't fit).  and if they are going to be that small, they need to be gusseted.  they are not.it is disappointing because they could be knock it out of the park good.  instead, i'll have to leave them on the bench.
72573	junk!  i know that's a strong stance.  but i've now worn them for the 3rd time (read, they have been washed 3 times) and they are already falling apart.  i pulled them from the dryer to find the snap missing off the waist tab.  and i went to slide my phone into the right hand magazine pocket to find that the threading had come out of one side of the pocket, causing my phone to hit the deck.  i'm not happy, not even a little bit.  also, a comment of general fit and finish before the degradation.  the elastic loops in the cargo pocket are ill placed, and the velcro squares in the rear pockets make you do the but scratch dance to get anything out of them.  anyway.  i'm going back to carhartt double fronts for my work and tactical wear needs.
72591	wow, what a great fit, very comfortable.  i have so much trouble finding my size and this shoe was no exception.  i wear a 12 1/2 aa but had to buy the 13 aa.  no problem with a little extra room, it is so close to a prefect fit.  i would recommend these shoes to anyone interested in a great fitting dress shoe of great quality.
72593	good fit good length durable sole and everything thrown in. got the wrong size...need to get at least a 14 and it might still be small liove the factory recrafting
72602	i've became a allen edmonds shoe brand fan over the summer 2012.i admire the high quality ,reputation,built,design etc.in fact this my first allen edmonds pair of shoes,and then bought a larchmont wing tip,and a kenwood(i donate that shoes to the hurricane sandy victims) i then bought a pair of walden penny loafers.now i will be getting my favorite shoe the fifth avenue oxfords,and that completes my collection. this shoe didn't take long to break in,it fits comfortable.great shoe for what it is besides the  style of the shoe.highly recommend!!!
72622	"my leather mini-backpack arrived today and i have to agree with the previous comments, this is a nice quality product for an excellent price. i'm the type of person who is forever looking for the perfect bag, as my closet corner full of rejects will attest. :)i have rheumatoid arthritis and carrying a regular purse in my hand is out of the question; even carrying it on one shoulder or cross-wise across my chest hurts my neck and shoulder after a while. i've been looking for a nice-looking back-pack style that'll distribute weight to both shoulders, has a ""low profile"" (in other words, it won't knock things off shelves every time i turn around), isn't too big or too small, has enough pockets, and doesn't have that annoying flap. (not picky much, am i?)this bag looks like it's going to work really well for me. love the adjustable straps and all the roomy pockets. there is room in the main compartment for anything i might feel like carrying, including my mini-netbook or ebook reader. i like the back-side pocket for my wallet, which keeps it securely against my body. i can grab my phone out of the side pocket without taking the whole bag off my shoulders.nice product, good value. i think i'll be carrying this one for a long time!"
72640	i am pleasantly surprised by the colors of the pendants, which more or less match the product image (although in sunlight, my citrine pendant appears more golden yellow than the orange-yellow in the product image, and the blue topaz is more of a watery sky blue, but not so pale that you can't tell it is a blue topaz). some of the other reviewers mentioned the pendants being bigger than they expected, so i included some measurements for all five pendants. the width is measured for the widest point.garnet: 18x5mm; stone alone: 9x5mmcitrine: 18x6mm; stone alone: 8x6mmamethyst: 16x8mm; stone alone: 8mmblue topaz: 17x6mm; stone alone: 9x6mmperidot: 17x7mm; stone alone: 7mmall except the peridot appear flawless to the eye, and even the wisp of inclusion in the peridot pendant is barely visible in sunlight (the color is a bit darker than shown in the product image, a brilliant apple green).  i got them for under 8 dollars per pendant, but even at full price, the quality of the pendants makes purchasing this set worth it.
72677	great value for the price.  soft.  nice scarf.my only complaint is that the 'companion scarf' (the free gift) is the exact same color as the one ordered.  i thought, from reading some of the reviews, that it would be patterned or different in some way.  nope.  same color.  same scarf.  maybe just a little different weight, but hardly noticeable.  so really you are getting 2 exact same scarves for the one price.i bought a dozen scarves to give out as gifts for coworkers and ended up mixing and matching their scarves so everyone got 2 different colors.  really, can't beat the price.:-)
72700	i love my new rothco camo shirt:.it fits perfectlytagless 'tags'comfortable materialchicks dig 'em!makes me wanna say,:&#34;i'll be back&#34;
72745	these are the socks to include in care packages that you send to soldiers in afganistan. the words of my grandson's thank you note say it all;  &#34;but most of all the greatest gift was those socks! these things are great out here. they keep my feet dry and cool. plus they're really thin for boot socks with makes it even better because they don't turn into sponges. the part that surprised me the most is that they're tan! not only are they in reg's but its not a dark color that soaks up heat. i've got to say i've been more than satisfied with them. funny thing is i've been looking for the right kind of boot socks for a long time. the army issues these green cotton ones that last only a few weeks and get just bheg. i cant find the heart to say it. then the store brands are always thick, with just gets to hot for the feet. i could just go on and on. thanks so much&#34;
72753	good sock it worked as expected, i used it for a orc because there is always water and it did great on the feet, and it keep a lot of the water out and it wasnt that wet, i would recommend them, they are thick in my opinion, but they should fit on regular walking or running shoes.5 stars great product, would recommend it.
72767	i don't need much support and that wasn't the problem with this bra... it's so sheer that you might as well be wearing nothing.  it doesn't fit well either and going up or down in size wouldn't make any difference.  i bought two and both of them are on their way back to amazon.
72875	used two of them on our trip to italy.  left one in the taxi from the airport in florence on the first day.  was able to retrieve it on the ride back to the airport at the end of the week.  was very happy with the straps.
72914	kudos to the inventor of this gadget! i have a really good rolling suitcase - theeagle creek travel gear tarmac 25 wheeled travel bag, and i usually carry a matching tote bag that has a back panel that slips over the rolling suitcase handle so i can manage both bags with one hand.but sometimes i'm not carrying a bag with a slip panel, and need a way to balance the smaller bag on top of my tarmac 25 so i can roll them along together, instead of having to carry the smaller bag.this gadget makes that possible. the instructions for using it are printed right on the back of it, so i was able to figure out how to fasten it to my rolling bag. and to figure it out again, the next time i used it, because i forgot in the interim.  i wouldn't mind the cords on this thing being just a little longer, but it's really sufficient for even large tote bags, as far as i can tell.i was going to get some regular hardware store bungee cords with hooks at the ends, to try lashing a bag to the top of my rolling bag, but i'm glad i found this gadget before resorting to that. it's small enough to slip into  the top outer pocket of my rolling bag, taking up almost no space, when not in use.
72944	i thought these would have a pocket inside so that i could slide in a business card or extra information.not so.  there is just a cloth flap for you to write your info on.  no pocket.
72966	should be fine - haven't used them yet, but i like how they are packaged.  i've loved woolite for years!
72978	i liked these.  for the price they do everything i need them to do.  the color makes them stand out and all the information is on the inside yet can be seen from outside.
73033	after seeing how much i enjoyed my pair of women's shape ups, my husband decided he wanted a pair of the men's.  we both have worn skechers in the past and wanted to try this design for its proclaimed exercise benefits.  these shoes are well constructed and are a great looking men's design.  adjustment to the rocker action took about one day of mindful practice.  the super-cushy souls are the greatest and the added benefit of specific muscle workouts took a few days to adjust to.  yes, you can feel which muscles are being awakened with these shoes, but this too becomes routine in a short while.  overall, this was a great purchase and would recommend these (most) comfortable shoes to others.
73049	i have three pairs of these boots in different colors.  i like the fit.  they are comfortable and keep my feet warm and cozy in our northwest rainy weather.  they are also nice looking.  i'm a fan!
73052	"i like the quality of this camisole.  it does run a bit small, so i recommend ordering a generous size.  the fabric and construction are good and it is comfortable to wear.  update:  after a few months, it still looks wonderful, washes and wears well.  so i ordered another in lavender, this time in extra large.  beautiful color, the shelf bra covers well enough to wear the lighter color.  and the extra large is a perfect fit (5'5"" with long waist).  definitely recommend the product, but order at least one size up."
73107	i already had this leotard in two other colors, and i love the style, fit and cotton material.bought the navy when i saw it on amazon for a good price.  very satisfied.
73119	i bought this to layer under high-waisted skirts or pants and lace tops. i ordered a medium that fits well - i probably could have gone with a small, but i didn't want to risk awkward underwear lines. i'm 5'3&#34; 130lbs and the length of the medium is good, the shelf-bra fits well, and the waist is tight enough to layer well.
73186	i needed some basic black short shorts for pole dance fitness class and these worked out perfectly.  they cover exactly what needs to be covered, but are short enough to be functional for pole dance and also flattering.  i found the shorts ran true to size.  i used the size chart & ordered a small & they fit perfectly.  i'm very happy with this purchase and bought a second pair!
73194	these are really great........ have been trying to find them again to purchase more!  want more in white, hope to find them!
73258	i love the idea of crocs without all the holes with fleece liners for cold weather, however the sizing on these is very different from most crocs.  the length is shorter, but the width is much wider (and i usually prefer a wide shoe).  otherwise, these are great.
73278	"the only pair of shoes that i have been unable to wear in years. the toe box is very shallow, creating pressure on the top of your toes. since the eva material is elastic and returns to original shape, this does not ""break in"". also, the liner is made with long, straight fibers, not looped which means that they compress and lose insulating qualities quickly. one of the few products where the original is of lower design quality than the cheap knock-offs."
73420	i wanted a 'goldilocks' backpack.  one that was not too big and not too small,, this one is just right!
73494	i thought this watch was beautiful on the website. well, it's even lovelier in person. the watch band comes a bit large, but that's a good thing. i hate when i buy a women's watch and the band is so small as if every woman is supposed to be petite with tiny wrists. michael kors takes that into consideration and leaves a little extra. if you don't know how, or aren't about to risk messing up a stunningly beautiful watch, like i am, you could always take the watch to the jewelers to have the wristband resized.again, this is a simply gorgeous watch. of course, as the band is white, you'll have to find a way to clean it 'cuz it will get a bit dirty. but, most jewelers carry all sorts of cleaning agents for fine watches. as soon as i get my watch to the mall for adjusting i'm going to grab a cleaner because i plan to get plenty of wear out of this beauty.oh, and it's definitely an authentic michael kors. no fake like some sellers on amazon. i matched my watch to the one in macy's and they were exact. the only difference is that i got such a deal at amazon and macy's watches were the original price of $225. love my watch and will be buying lots more michael kors!
73597	i dont like the super control and thats what you get when ordering your size, could have gone up to xx-l and would have been fine and more like med control, other than that..nice shapewear. i wear a 10-12 and ordered the xl
73636	although i got mine to wear for halloween, it could easily be worn under something for a dressy occasion.  it is very comfortable and well made.
73649	i found this to be a bit uncomfortable.  when sitting, the bottom seems to roll up and not stay in its place.  it really sucks you in though.  i am not a big person, but wanted something to look slimmer in my jeans.  this did the trick, but i could only wear it for a couple of hours, then needed to take it off.
73683	my boyfriend got me this bracelet for my birthday and it is the best gift i have ever received. i wear it every single day, and can't help but be encouraged by it. at each glance, i am constantly reminded of the complex love jesus has for us, and how we should be striving to love others this way as well. i highly recommend anything that stirs thoughts such as these on a daily basis :)
73732	really impressed with this, when purchasing as not seeing had feared it would look cheap and light weight but my lady loves it and is a good quality item that was delivered quickly.
73739	an excellent gift for a friend that will soon be moving away.  nicely made and packaged.  simple and elegeant and nicely priced.
73763	i love dockers briefs and i like to wear trunks also so i thought i would give these a try and i'm glad i did.  admittedly they felt a little weird at first, like they were 95% lycra and 5% cotton, instead of the opposite.  however, after a couple of washes they've changed to feeling and looking more like cotton.  they're an excellent fit, with a firm but giving elasticity around the legs, a very comfortable pouch, and a wide, soft waistband.  they look great too, my girlfriend loves them, and the color choices are decent.*notes:1. if you are buying these for someone else; they are not boxer briefs, they are trunks, which are shorter (in-between a brief and a boxer brief).2. they are also 'stretch' trunks, so there is a small amount of lycra/spandex type material in them, so they will feel a little different at first.3. they have no fly.
73775	i have bought several pairs of sunglasses trying to find the right mix of fit and design after vision correction through cataract surgery. i thought a pair of oakley scalpel sunglasses would end my search but had vision problems due to the lens.decided to give these a try based upon other reviews and i think this will be the end of my search! they're stylish, extremely lightweight and comfortable, and no vision distortion.just wish i'd waited due to the price drop between last week when i ordered and this week.
73802	i am a farmer and wear these boots 24/7 365 and they are great.. they have been through every type of weather and terrain and they have held up awesome.. very comfortable and little break in time.. highly recommend..
73841	i love dansko clogs and have no complaints about the comfort or durability of the shoes but i picked the brown tooled pattern and i expected it to stay on the shoe. they are not tooled but are stamped and the pattern and color was laid over the top. that would have been ok if the leather underneath had been brown but it was a creamy color that did nothing for the look of the shoe. i have had to try several types of shoe polish-- the kind in the flat tin just buffed off. liquid worked a little better but have to dab it on and reapply often. i would not have bought this pattern if i had known how they would wear.
73850	"ugh. stupid me for thinking i might find an everyday shoe just as comfortable as the dansko ""professional"" but with a sleeker look. maybe such a shoe exists, but the ""solstice"" is not it. yes, it's narrower than the ubiquitous ""professional"" style clog, and the heel looks a little higher (although dansko's measurements say they're exactly the same so it must just be styling). but the material the solstice sole uses is entirely different, which makes the insole different, which makes the whole shoe different... i tried them on in my bedroom while sorting summer/winter clothes for about an hour. not walking around, just standing. on a rug. and it only took an hour before my feet were in more pain than i could have imagined possible. the soles of my feet actually hurt, horribly, from ball to arch to heel. the shoe itself fit fine, was not too tight anywhere. so it had to be the heavier/harder material solstice uses for its soles. dansko makes several models that are identical to the solstice but for minor aesthetic detail, so i'd look carefully at the soles and avoid all versions of this style. from reviews it seems that some people prefer a harder sole, perhaps more to help with back problems/alignment. but for foot comfort, these are awful. and fwiw, they're not cute either. they do look less like you're a chef in a restaurant kitchen than the ""professionals"", but they just look different, not better."
73868	i had to return these shoes, i was very dissapointed at the quality of what dansko was supposed to represent. the 'old' dansko's i had (2yr old), were exactly the same size, but they had arch support & were not tight around the ankles & too big in the toe area.i wore them for 1 day & 2 weeks later i still have a sprain/strain in my ankle from walking the way that these shoes placed my foot in the wrong place.i thought that dansko shoes were superior orthopedic shoes for people who have problems & need more arch support.  also the quality of the leather is pitted & creases easily. around the ankle it is made of a terry cloth fabric, very prone to getting dirty & worn out quickly. wanted them to work, tried inserts, still very bad. returned them. still have no shoes for work.
73873	i love these shoes!  they seem a little pricey for my budget but i can smell the leather and you can tell that these are very high quality materials and how they are made.  i normally wear a size 10 but bought the size 41 and the fit is good.  i wore knee high hose with them & can tell socks would make the fit too tight.  i have a wide foot at the bone up from my toes and that was the only sore part of my foot after wearing them all day at my desk job & then grocery shopping for half an hour afterwards.  they look really nice with my brown slacks that are dressy/casual for work.  the heel says like 2 1/4&#34; (i think) but i measured it from the floor to the top of the heel & it was really 3&#34;, since i'm tall that concerned me but no problem.  the arch support is what i needed and the cushiony inside since i have plantar facsitious (sp?).  they are very comfortable, i think my wide foot will fit better once they stretch out alittle.  i would buy them again too :)
73913	this is a great cap.  kangol makes to quality hats to begin with, but the bamboo material adds &#34;breathability&#34; that you are not going to get out of wool or other man-made fabrics.  wear it with the cap in the front or the cap in the back, either way is a sharp look.  there is no excess material to make it look like a beanie or paperboy cap.  it is a sleek look--the new cap for the new millenium!
73920	looked at a bunch of skorts to wear to disneyworld and decided on these.....came sooner than expected and they fit great!  it is extremely comfortable and looks great on!  my hubby loves them and thinks they look &#34;sexy&#34; on me!  they are the perfect length, falling about mid thigh.  the material is better than i expected.  i bought a large expecting it to shrink a little.  i'm 5'2&#34; 155lbs.  if you're on the fence about purchasing i suggest you go for it....you won't regret it!
73932	lovely skirt. very sturdy and well-constructed while still being fun and cute. as the others said, be careful when bending down. i wore mine with patterned tights and got lots of compliments.
73992	fits nicely.  i wear a medium in most clothes, and this fits.  lot's of give: if you normally wear a large or xlarge, i think this dress would still fit well.  dress hugs curves and flatters breasts; however, material is a bit scratchy.  perhaps that's unavoidable considering how the dress is made, the design of the dress and the material that the dress is made out of (feels a bit like nylon).  i ordered in white to maybe wear as a long shirt with a white cami underneath.  i'm thinking of ordering pink next.
74021	i don't know if there are two versions of the nike cortez because i had a pair when i was younger and i loved them. but these shoes kill my feet when worn for more than an hour. this is a terrible shoe!!!!! spend a little bit more and get one that doesn't give you blisters.
74024	good pants well made they run a little long though.  i wear a 32 in length because you can't find a 31and the 32 is never too long in any other brand of pants however the 32 in this brand was too long fit more like a 34 so if you're in between sizes like me go with the size down not the size up.
74092	this gown material is terrible, after one wash it created lent balls all over it, after while i threw it in the trash, because i just did not feel it was worth spending shipping and handling sending it back, i would never order a gown from this company. poor material!!
74102	tired of sleeping is ratty old tank tops i decided i needed some real sleepwear.  why i don't already have any is a mystery to me, i guess i've neglected to buy myself any pajamas in the past 20 years, only lounge wear.  anyway, after reading the great reviews of this gown i decided to order the purple for myself.  it was an excellent decision.  this gown is fantastic!  i plan to buy more colors and create a sleepwear collection for myself.  i deserve it, after all!
74109	i have worn these gowns for years and love them.  they have gotten more and more expensive so this is a great price.  if you want a cotton gown these are not for you but if like the feel of nylon, these gowns are really confortable.
74116	got this as a present for my mom. she said that the fit was good and well the product arrived on time no complaints.
74132	i am very impressed with the look of these chains for the price. they look great when worn at the same time as they layer perfectly. look great with or without charms. my only complaint is the packaging. they arrived in a bag loose with no cardboard separater and were a tangled knot that took me about 30 minutes to unravel.
74147	"they are all of good quality it seems. i love box chains they are much harder to break than regular chains and these were all a good length. i actually gave the 16"" to my daughter her favorite locket chain had broken (it was not a box chain) i am thinking that this one will last longer and with her being eleven 16"" is good for her. i like the 20"" the best but believe it or not but the 30"" looks good with some of my darker dressier shirts and dresses :) i am happy great product for a great price!"
74169	my co-worker, valerie received the chain and did not like it due to the misleading size.  the chain appears to be much larger on the screen.
74254	my feet sweat twice as much with these so-called &#34;moisture control&#34; socks.  i am returning these along with a few other pairs i ordered.  i won't even bother trying on the others since they are dockers as well and also claiming to have &#34;moisture control&#34;.  they're also really big fyi (long, go real far up your leg)
74284	it is funny how sometimes the best hat is the hat you actually have on you! that is what the best selling point of this hat is since you can roll it up and throw it into any bag or purse. my wife loves this hat and takes it everywhere. it also looks quite fashionable but now whenever we are out in the sun she just takes it out. the only downside to the hat is that there is no string for putting under your chin so wind easily blows this hat off. that is a minor inconvenience considering you can take this hat anywhere and it provides such great sun protection!
74433	i've been losing allot of weight and was tired of buying new pants every couple of weeks.  these worked great for holding up my pants.  worse them underneath my shirt over my under shirt.  no longer needed to pull my pants up every day.the clamps to adjust the length never seem to fully work, they have to be readjusted 2-3 times a day.one of the clamps in the front came undone and had to be super glued back.before i got undershirts when it was against my skin, i would sweat and it ended up giving me a rash in the back.
74441	actually bought it as a halloween costume piece.  the clasp could be better.  to bite down fully, the hinge end must clear the band material, but not a trouble, if known.
74443	my dad has tried many brands of suspenders.  he says these are the best.  definitely worth paying extra for vs other brands.
74448	very good suspenders. the belt clips work good and are heavy enough to last. i specially like the rear single belt clips. it is easy to remove the rear clips for a potty break and reattach when done...the only problem is that the length is a bit short for big guys. another three inches would be nice.... the elastic is good quality and comfortable under the shirt.
74465	the boots look great and are very comfortable.  the only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the smooth sole.  i pray they dont turn out to be slippery on wet roads.
74498	color is as expected. nice quality. i bought it specifically for the month of october because of its color but can wear it any other month fall/winter. prompt delivery and package undamaged.
74516	i've got a generous bosom and i'm 52--i need support. i own many wacoal bras, some panache, anita, elomi, etc.i recently got this style in the ivory, and it's amazing. the prettiest bra i've got that still keeps me uplifted and supported and is comfortable. but dang, if this ain't one gorgeous, femnine, seductive bra. girly and functional. win-win.it's really expensive, and i didn't get it here at amazon, but this bra gets a total thumbs up from me. now, i want it in black and whatever other color i can. i'm normally a 38ddd or 36dddd, and in this style, i got a 36f, cause i plan to lose a bit more weight. it fit even in the smaller band size. i probably could have gone one cup size up to g as a consequence..but it's doing fine. if you're a ddd, get the f.carefully measure and notice the size differences from us sizing. this bra takes european sizing. so, d = d. dd=e. ddd=f. dddd=g. you can easily find the sizing chart for us vs. euro online by searching.enjoy this beauty!
74518	so i got my bra size as 36d uk but the band was uncomfortable, a bit snug but i could feel every wire. it's beautifully made but the cups were huge on me. i have that small cup with flat boob top (ski slope) and bigger under bust and wide rib cage. so it's always tight on my ribs but so much space where my boobs go. wish i had boobs like the picture. i'm returning it. even if it fit, the material and wire was uncomfortable in the middle. i'm realizing more and more that girls like me need to get half bras because although the bra fits my under bood, by the time the bra reaches the top over my boob, it's wrinkly and has so much space. shallow boobs. this would be adorable for those with much bust up top but i still couldn't recommend it because the wire in the middle hurt like hell and dug in after only having it on for a couple minutes. it left a red mark between my boobs.
74539	as with most clarks, these boots are quite comfortable, but required a breaking in period for me. once they strechted out a little, they became much more comfortable. i love the style of the boot, with the dressy, slightly shiny leather and the detail on the side. the heal height a little low for me, but perfect for walking around downtown in. i love these boots and wear them all the time in the winter (especially with leggings/tights and a dress/skirt).
74542	i bought these boots while i was pregnant, needing a boot with a wider calf that would accommodate my swollen calves and ankles in the fall and winter. the heel was perfect height - not tall, but just enough when you are used to wearing a bit of a heel and like the added height. they withstood a winter in nyc salt and snow and still look and feel great 2 yrs later. the best part is the laced gusset which runs down the outside of the shaft. the lace is actually elastic which offers some much appreciated give in the width. there is also the usual elastic insert on the inside upper shaft. now that i am back to normal weight, but still have larger calves, the boots are still great with dresses, under pants or even over jeans (thanks to the elastic lace gusset they stretched but kept their shape). i have never seen knee boots with the stretch on the outside (without looking like elastic) which makes them so much more versatile. the leather feels smooth and soft, but is tough and keeps its looks, withstanding nicks and peels. the brown is a nice deep chocolate brown. the rubber sole is great on even icy snow and has yet to wear down. i love that i can travel with one pair of shoes/boots that go with anything, anywhere! did i mention how much i love these boots?!
74570	this hat is perfect for me. it is well made and quite elegant worn with a maxi dress. and it does what it is expected to do protect me well from the sun.i am a size medium head and the fit is good.
74624	i have been looking for a new favorite cotton thong since gap stopped making their low (but not super low) cut thongs, and these are great!  they have just enough fabric to hold them up without showing above my pants.
74646	"i read the reviews on this style of fitflop and even though i had a pair of the original walkstars in a size 10, i ordered a size 9. well, it was too small. the tags advise you to take 20-30 brisk steps in the sandal and if your heel slides off the back of the sandal or to the right or left at all, you need to go up a size. all of these sandals seem to be made for long toes, as the length in front of my toes is almost as long in the size 9 as my size 10's. i am therefore exchanging the 9's for 10s, as the 9's are too small. i do have wide feet although i can wear normal width shoes with no problems, so i don't know if that's why they are more true to size for me. it might be a good idea to find them in a store first and walk around the store in them a bit and then order them here - as they are usually cheaper on amazon with more colors and free shipping.as far as the fit part goes, i don't really know yet, i ordered them based on reviews from people who have back and leg problems and have reported no pain when using these sandals. as a person with sciatica and almost no cartilage in my arthritic left knee, these are so comfortable i can walk three times as far with no pain as is any other of my supposedly ""comfortable shoes"". if you care about the fit part, they may work, but if you are looking for comfortable shoes because of back or knee problems, i could not recommend these sandals highly enough!"
74667	since i'm a dd cup, i usually wear underwire bras for their support. i need side-support, even with the proper cup size. underwire bras in the proper cup size still poke into my sides, but most wire-free bras don't provide the breast support that an underwire does. this bra delivers the side-smoothing and the support that i've been looking for.it's so comfortable! i'd always heard of women who 'forget they're wearing a bra' or who don't fling theirs off the instant they walk through the front door. i thought they were things of myth, until the first day i wore this bra. this is everything i've been looking for. i'm ordering one in every color now!
74686	i was so excited to get these shoes for christmas.  i wore them during my regular walking routine (3 miles/5 days/week).  after the first week, my back felt like it had a pinched nerve - alot of pain.  my chiropractor made an adjustment and i was better in a couple of days.  put the shoes back on, walked, started my daily routine with shoes on.  i noticed my pain was coming back - i took the shoes off - back pain subsided in couple of hours.  i have not put the shoes back on and i have not had anymore back pain since going about regular and exercise routine with my regular walking shoes.  i also noticed if wore the easytones for extended time in the day my toes would get numb.
74692	"let's face it, there are no miracle cures for our flabby muscle tone, but if a shoe can help, i'm all for it.  personally, i love sneakers and i dislike wearing shoes.  i am an on the go mom, but i do sit at my computer way too much! i bought these with high hopes and i love them!day 1:  first impression was that they were a comfy walking shoe....but i didn't really feel anything different.day 2:  hmm...my legs are a little sore...this is all good!!! i love that feeling!day 3:  i did a bit more walking than usual and this morning, i can feel it in my muscles!i have to add as a side note, these shoes also make me stand up straighter!buy with confidence and give the product a chance! again, there are no miracle cures, but so far, i love them and would love another pair!!update:now that several months have passed, i feel the need to update my review with additional information.  this sneaker did not ""wear well"" at all.  i began experience knee and hip pain. i couldn't understand why.  i switched out of these and went back to regular sneakers and all was fine. by looking at the shoe, you can see the wear and how i have been walking uneaven for several weeks now! huge disappointment!"
74696	if you want a watch winder that is for women's watch like size this is the winder for you.  non of my watches could fit into this winder.  i wear big watches 50 mm etc but it is your typical men's watch and it was not even a close fit.  if you have small dainty watches this is the winder for you, if you have an actual real men's watch this winder is worthless.
74699	like many other people here have suggested, your watch needs to be wound before placing it in the winder.anyone who is knocking the watch winder because it's ugly is clearly an idiot. you can't complain about how something is cheap and plastic when you bought the item because it is cheap and plastic. that's a complaint with your wallet, not the winder. the winder works perfectly for almost all of my higher end watches, which is good considering my big bang has trouble winding in a $300 orbita.the only problem with the winder is that any watch over 6 oz. is too heavy for the plastic clips that hold the watch in place. as it spins, the watch will jostle around making a very annoying knocking sound. now its not a loud noise, but it is noticeable in a quiet space like my walk in closet. i'm only in there for a few minutes at a time which is why i gave it a 4-star rating. if, however, you plan on putting this in a space you frequent and you have some heavier pieces, then i would strongly suggest you increase your budget stronger winder.i think the reason no one has caught on to this flaw is because most people buying a $40 winder aren't putting a watch in them that are made of enough material to weigh over 6 oz. well i have, and let me tell you anything made of precious metal, has a lot of diamonds, or a really large solid case will knock around in this winder. if you have a run of the mill rolex, tag, or omega you would be fine. otherwise, get something that is made of wood...
74703	wanted an inexpensive winder for my invicta pro diver's. both watch's will only wind in the counter clockwise direction. this winder filled that requirement. it makes a little noise when running but nothing that will keep you awake.
74820	i got this to hold a larger pendant, and it works great. wish it was a little shorter, but for the price it is well worth it!!
74845	this is absolutely beautiful!  i got it as a gift for my sister and opened it up and oh my word it is really really pretty.  hefty without being bulky, the perfect size for a large pendant, it's just truly beautiful.the clasp is more an ordinary clasp like for a regular chain - i don't know if that's normal for silver omega chains i thought it would be something more secure like for pearls or the gold omega i have.  but it doesn't detract from the beauty of the piece.as a gift or an essential part of your own jewelry collection this is a beautiful rendering of a basic piece.
74904	i like these.  nice enough to last several months of hard use, cheap enough to not mind replacing them.  they could be a bit thicker though.
74912	my husband likes tube socks that go almost to the knee so they tend to &#34;stay up&#34; better.he seems to like them and they are holding up to being worn in rotation of usage.we will probably purchase them again. the price was comparable.
74923	i purchased these for my sister for christmas. they are so beautiful i bought  another for her (and a pair of matching earrings for me!) and kept the first one for myself. the pearls have a nice lustre, are quite large and are irregular. none of them match. to me that means i can wear them with more things. clasp is  easy to use and so far secure. and when it turns around on your neck the clasp is decorative. great price.
74928	look like the picture. fit like socks. function as socks. theyre socks. lol if it means anything i will be ordering another pair so i have more socks. lmao
74950	i wanted a sock with extra reinforcement on the toes, and these do that. they're really soft too. my only complaint is that they were thicker than i thought they were going to be, so my sneakers fit a bit tighter than usual. i haven't had a problem with them on my long walks, but it's just something to keep in mind. if i were to buy them again, i think i would go for another size to reduce the thickness.
74973	although these socks initially seem to be decent, they are not durable at all. after just one wear, i can see holes starting to appear. i guess you get what you pay for. i would not recommend these.
74998	these are thick, warm, sturdy socks, and at about $1 per pair, a good bargain.  i recommend them if you want warm, thick socks, but they're not for summertime wear.
75065	these shoes were sized small.  i needed to go up a full size larger to get them to fit me.  no other shoes have i ever had were sized so incorrectly.  these had to be tried on before purchase.
75070	this watch is awesome.  it tells the time and does a bunch of other stuff that you can read about in other reviews.  the face scratches a bit easier than i would have hoped but it was under $25 so i can't really complain.  when this one gets too scratched to read i can just buy another one.  i expect it will last at least another year or two and by then the battery might be gone and it's time for a new watch anyway.  i could replace the battery, but at this price it's just easier to get a whole new watch.  it looks really good too.  i get a lot of compliments on the watch.
75124	this scarf is beautiful, the color is true to the picture and is super soft.  the only disappointment would be that the tassels on the ends are all flat and misshapen from packaging.  plus there were a few small but hardly noticeable snags on the middle of the scarf.  i will buy another color eventually but hopefully quality is a little better next time.
75169	i bought these for the beach and snorkeling when i realized i needed to save my skin from the sun.  they were cool enough to wear on the beach during the day with the sea breeze. they are wonderful for snorkeling.  the fabric is designed for wear in swimming pools or salt water--just be sure to follow the washing and rinsing instructions.  this is another great coolibar product.
75235	i don't know if i received a bad pair of boots but they looked great and seemed very well made but when i put them on my foot hit something in the boot so i had to return them.
75285	i tried a similar pair of kamik boots on my toddler at a local store in the same size (i think they were the waterbug variety) and then ordered these assuming they would fit him.  wrong!  i literally couldn't even get his foot into these.  i pulled out the inner liner to see exactly how they weren't fitting, and they were extremely narrow.  i was really disappointed because they are obviously well-made and super-warm boots.  for reference, he wears about a 7 or 7.5 in most shoes, and i ordered these in an 8.
75351	i got these for my friend who can only wear mbts, making her, like many,  so upset with the initial owners going out of business.  seeing, hearing,  all the complaints about far lower quality shoes coming from the new owners, while  seeing the original mbts dissappear from everywhere but, and including, amazon, inspired this expensive, urgent, (as most women will agree),  xmas present from me.  she works so hard on her feet all day, and night as the caregiver for her mom too, really are necessities for her,  especially wearing a size 11!  hard enough to even find shoes in this size, let alone those one needs truly.it surely was worth the expense seeing her face when she opened them, got her the kisumu 2's as well, perfect fits of course,  much relief by her.  i had ordered 4 other pair also, mbts we think of the new company, which just weren't the same quality, support, as these &#34;sport' models, (at less than half the price of these naturally with amazon's fabulous sale).so no big surprise that these fit her, foot insurance i say,  though in  'my&#34; desperate search for her before all were gone, (unles these models will be produced  the same way by the new owners, seems very profitable), we found a really good replacement shoe we want all with her same issues to know, (we also bought with amazon's too tempting sale).  these are the &#34;ryn&#34; brand,  which my friend likes as well as the mbts!!  more in fact as they are very cute, modern,  with the &#34;air jordaan' bubble in the 2&#34; thick rocker soles!!  and,  as we expect these days in our search also for the &#34;ryns&#34;, nobody had any in stock though they, (walking,  sports, specialty stores), advertised them in their  store brochures, ads, (in a size 11 even more rare)!so, it was &#34;amazon the the rescue&#34;,  again with these new &#34;mbts', the fashionable 'ryns', (for men and women) are here,  and we need to support them to keep them in business, growing, we urge everyone to try them.  for less than half the price of mbts too!  check them out here.  we never would have known of them though she had seen thm advetised, if amazon hadn't wisely placed them on site, at the end of the mbt  selection!!  and can be found under &#34;ryn&#34; we know now.  perhaps the best of this binge of buying is that is was only possible with amazon's necessary now for me, &#34;prime&#34; membership, free shipping,  returns, allowing us to try on the ultra personal, life necessity, shoes, no more having to keep shoes, otther items, just because don't want to paay shipping back on lower end stuff  we all get stuck keeping, weighing the cost of returns to the price of the item,  with such a variable product like shoes.  gone are the days of just going to the mall or neighborhood shoe store,  force to buy what they had on hand.  as my firend had no idea that amazon sells shoes!  the biggest shoe store in the world for good or ill!
75353	what can be said about mbt...i've been wearing these shoes for years now. i replace them every 6 months as the tread goes.the best investement for sore feet, low back problems and shin splints.love love these shoes
75379	"i had purchased dickies scrub tops in the past and was pleased with the quality. when i needed new scrub tops i went online (not amazon!) and ordered a different brand - it was described as a mens scrub top but turned out to be fitted and designed more for a woman. so i got onto amazon and checked out the dickies. i am wearing it as i type. it is well made, plenty of pockets, and after a wash the fabric feels comfortable and soft. it has pleats on the back near the shoulders to allow for ease of movement. like most scrubs, the sizes tend to run larger than for other clothes. i wear a large size t-shirt, but always get medium scrub tops (i am 5'10"", 180lbs). this seems to be of a higher quality than the basic one pocket bargain scrub tops, but i think it was worth it."
75404	true to size. i'm a size 37.5 and xs fits nicely, no extra material running under my feet even after running around.
75407	my husband loves these socks and swears by them.  he never gets blisters any more.  he ordered the extra large (he wears a size 12.5) and they fit him perfectly.
75485	belt sizing is correct. it is exactly what i wanted - an easy-care black belt without the trimmings that i can wear with anything -- casual or dressy.
75492	"i purchased this belt to wear my ""hippy"" jeans - notice i didn't say ""hippie""! i'm female and even though it's a men's belt, the size (34) and style are perfect as just a basic brown belt. after a few weeks of wear, it's softened up a bit and isn't quite as stiff as it was on day-1. good value for the money."
75507	not true to size. i purchased two different sizes and had to return both. was really looks forward to these fitting.
75611	i ordered this as a birthday gift for a young girl who was turning 11. when it arrived i was quite impressed with the quality of the piece. the butterfly is a decent size, being even a little larger pendant than i anticipated it would be. the colors were marbled much like the photo online, only the one i received had a more purple and blue tone. while it doesn't really show a persons mood, it does change colors with different temperatures. the necklace length is a little adjustable, as the clasp can be hooked onto one of several little links at the end of the cord like necklace. the colors and design are so cute, i am ordering one for my own 11 year old daughter and one for myself to wear this summer!
75633	it does say small, and they were.  i bought them for my daughter butafter seeing how small they are, gave them to a grand child under 12.good quality.  probably my fault for not really investigating the size.fast shipment.
75691	these earrings are about the size of a 50 cent piece. they are very nice for the price. not too big, and not too small. they are a little on the thin side though. i typically like a thicker hoop, but these were for my 11 year old daughter and she prefers the thinner hoops. since these were on sale and i paid less than $15 for them, is was a good purchase and i recommend them at that price point. i didn't notice any flaws on them, they close securely and are polished nicely.
75737	i love wearing these light weight, shiny earrings.  they are just the right size, comfortable and bright, and great for everyday wear. that said, i gave them 4 stars rather than 5 because they do not have the feel of sterling silver. rather they feel more like a synthetic.  which is fine, especially considering their inexpensive price, but just not quite what i expected.
75754	these are very cute to look at and the price was right, but no matter how much i squeeze the hook at the top, they tend to fall out very easily so i don't wear them.  too bad.
75823	this robe is perfect for a big man. i bought a xxl sized robe and i am 6'3&#34;, 215 lbs,  i have room to spare in the robe and i love it.  what is really good about this robe is it is made of 100% cotton terry cloth!. that means it absorbs moisture and it breathes. the fabric is thick too much like your best bath towel. it's great for temperatures in the sixties. however i need a lighter weight robe for seventy and up. the hood is great for when you want to take a nap. it's big, covers your whole head and blocks light just right. i nap in it often.  all in all this is a real good buy.
75828	the robe was very heavy, but not soft at all. i didn't wan't to see if fabric softener would work for the price i paid.
75831	the style, size and length are great. for the price, i expected the material to be slightly more plush, softer or more luxurious. the material is heavy but it feels rough like cheap bath towel. i do like the ankle length and the hood is nice. it is heavy but i don't find it that warm to wear.
75844	i'm 5'8 and the length brushes the top of my feet. i ordered a large - enough room to be comfortable (i'm not a 'stick girl') but not too large. the sleeve length it perfect when cuffed and un-cuffed will allow you to slide your hands up and keep the fingers warm when you laze around on cold days.
75869	i love hermoines time turner! being the huge harry potter fan i am i had to get this. the hour glass is said to be fragile so even though i wear it almost everyday and it still hasn't broken, i even fell asleep with it on a few times but i don't recommend that unless your ok with it breaking but its so cute. when you do wear it around a lot the gold on the chain fades off so its no longer a pure gold look but a silver-gold (this is in a period of weeks not days), kinda disappointing but thats ok. i only wish the chain was longer but no biggy its still super cute!! the engravings are easy to read and it spins! just like in the movie!! xd (did i mention i'm a huge harry potter fan?) i recommend this to any die heart hp fans.  even though it has a few glitches i totally recommend this product to anyone thinking of buying it. its definitely worth it!! so cute! :)
75871	as a replica, this is a very attractive item.  it looks like hermoine's time turner; it spins; and there is the inscription on the sides.drawbacks:1) it's very fragile.  holding it in your hand, you can tell that it's not something that'll withstand rough play. the glass/plastic in the center is very thin.  it's something you'll keep in its box, not actually use.2) the chain: it's ridiculously short.  it's made of a cheap-quality metal.  it doesn't have a normal clasp but instead has the rough hole + pin link.  worst of all, the chain isn't connected through the timeturner through a normal round clasp; it's permanently attached on both sides of the timeturner so you can't even buy a better quality replacement chain for it.overall opinion: despite the nice look of it, the timeturner is absurdly priced.  the quality of the product i received did not match the pricetag.
75950	these will be useful, which is why i ordered them, but the are much flimsier than gold toe socks from even 2 yeara ago. would be more disappointed but globalism is about the lcd not the best quality for the best value.
75956	"mmm!  if you're especially tall, they may not be long enough for you, as i had to work incredibly hard to get these up to my waist!  i'm also quite ""voluptuous"", so perhaps that had a hand in it as well.  i'm a size 16 and 5'11.5.  they look great, and good quality, too.  i absolutely love we love colors!"
75961	i love these slippers!  i've never had a pair so comfortable or attractive.  i generally wear an 8 1/2 w shoe, and this 8-9 sized pair are a tad hard to get on, but five stars nonetheless.  i was surprised to feel some arch support when i first wore these.  my husband loves them and i'm searching for a pair for him for christmas.  i would buy these again (and probably will) and would recommend them to anyone.  just great.  thank you!
76007	i bought this in white for my informal wedding reception at home. i like it but it has issues.the good:-it is cute-it has many ways to wear it that are fairly easy to figure out. (if you can't get a certain look right, try turning the dress around)-it is cool and light for summer-it is great and stretchy, and i imagine it would be super comfy as a maternity dressthe bad:-it is very thin. i have other jersey fabric dresses that are not this thin. in white, it is see through. i had to wear a slip which didn't make it lay right.- it stretches out while you are wearing it. i had to tighten it at least 3 times because as i wore it it became looser. but washing it brought it back to original tightness.i think i could sew the same thing in a different fabric and it would look a lot better. overall, for the price it isn't bad, but it isn't awesome either. i might buy more of these when i get pregnant because it can go from non-maternity, to maternity, to post maternity. i could also see using these as swimsuit covers.
76014	every woman should have this dress. i have received so many compliments. you can wear it so many ways.  one of my friends liked it so much she went out and bought one too.
76039	smaller than i thought and no wire in the rim of the hat. it was advertised has having wire in the rim and also able to shape it. not true at all. it's small enough thou that the rim stays up. very nice color and true to the pictures.
76053	worked fine during our time in the tropical sun and will do very well once the gardening season starts.  wish they offered the hat in a true small size.
76073	these boots are a great deal and very comfortable. believe the reviews and order a size smaller than the shoe size you typically wear.
76074	these are great boots.  warm and comfortable, just as good as the more expensive brands in my opinion.  i think they run pretty true to size, so i would order your usual size.  my daughter wears a size 4 - 5 in shoes and we purchased the size 5, fits perfectly.
76093	i loved these so much right out of the box that i've already ordered the slippers, the maddie loafers and a pair of active inserts for my riding boots. they are stiff and not the soft, cushy pillows i'd hoped for but who cares!!! my feet stopped hurting and i didn't even have to wrap them last night when i slept. fabulous! so glad i found them.
76145	i needed a short to carry my iphone in my pocket on long walks. this shirt works fine for what i want it to do. have looked at buying more, but the color/size selection is hit or miss.
76207	buying bras online is a bit of an adventure.  buying a strapless is even more scary.  i tried this one on the advice of my daughter and ordered two sizes.  with amazon's free return on clothing, i was able to return easily if they didn't work.  the bra is a good design and stays up well thanks to the grippy strips on both edges of the band.  i kept the one that fit best and returned the other.  the price was also great.  a surprising success story!
76310	one of them had most of the fringe turned up. the other shoe a little. preventable. i dont know the cure. would have given higher rating with nice fringe.
76314	"i just got these today so i can't comment on the comfort of extended wear, but as of now i have no complaints. they're super soft and feel amazing, like all minnetonka shoes i've owned. i'm so impressed with this brand's quality for their price. my chestnut kilty's are my go-to shoe for every day wear (i've had them for almost 2 years and wore them a lot) and i wanted a mocassin i could wear with big, warm socks. their sizing is a little weird. i typically wear a size 8.5-9.0 in shoes, but i have the minnetonka kilty's in a size 8.0 and another pair of minnetonka flats in an 8.5. their mocassin boots run very large, so i ordered these in a size 8.0 and they are a bit tight but will work (they should stretch just a little). one shoe also seemed to fit much tighter than the other, but the laces are operable so i just loosened it up some and now it feels much better. my only issue is deciding if i like them in black or if i'd rather get them in chestnut!as far as people being concerned about the fringe ""turning up,"" that's what real leather does! i think a little turn-up doesn't affect the look of this shoe because the fringe is short, but there are also ways of correcting this if it bothers you (google: how to straighten suede fringe)."
76319	i have had this bag for almost  2 years now and have had zero problems. no it's not a huge bag. i needed something to hold a few extra clothes, my phone, and a few bike tools when i go riding.zippers works fine and it hold my gear. it also stays on my back nice and doesn't move around when adjusted properly.nice bag that fits great vs a larger regular backpack size.
76350	these shoes were just what i was looking for to replace my white tennies to wear with jeans.  they are true to size (7 1/2 n) and when they arrived, i put them on and wore them to the store.  so comfortable.  toe box was nice and roomy and the heel doesn't rub up and down.  very pleased.
76374	this item surprised me, the quality is exceptional and our 3 yr old grandson is crazy about it.i am very glad i purchased it.
76421	this purchase was the first purchase for me from playtex.  this bra is so comfortable, no pinching in the back, no shoulder strap slips, and the comfort is unbelievable.  i could run in this bra with total comfort and support.  i will never wear any other bra...it's the best!  love the colors, too!
76431	i like this bra it fits well with good support it is hard to find good bras for large breast especially if you are not full figured i would buy more of this bra
76520	eew. i was really hopeful with this bra, i am pregnant and wanted something comfortable to support my growing chest. like other reviewers, i found the underwire to be horribly uncomfortable and dig in. but the worst part about this bra is it makes my boobs look like they point out to the sides and look really far apart, somewhat reminiscent of a bad madonna costume from the 80's. skip it.
76523	i love this bra!!  i have had issues with either the cup being a weord shape so my breasts do not fill them properly and there are pockets, or i cannot find a 44c.  this bra is great, fits great, puts my boobs where they need to be and i fill out the cup completely so no tucks or wrinkles when wearing a t-shirt.  i will buy more.
76544	i cannot remember where i bought my bra, but it is much less expensive here at amazon so i am ordering three more.  it is the most comfortable bra that i have ever owned.  i have fallen asleep on the couch and in the morning, i still do not know that i have it on my body! and i thought that playtex bras were only for old ladies!  lol
76552	love the bra itself but it is not true to size. i wear all playtex bras and this one runs a little small.
76566	i wear this bra as much as possible, and i'm so glad that i started writing review on amazon, today! i had forgotten where i had purchased it! now i can order more of these bras.
76574	"a lot of wire free bras stop at c cups, at least by the bra makers for so-called ""average figures"" such as warners.  this bra fits well, it is very comfortable and is modest (full coverage).  i think there's enough of a padding to this bra so that those concealing petals aren't needed.  i could really care less about this latest bra gimmick.  the petals are placed high in the cup ... another reminder that i'm not as perky as i used to be.  the main flaw with this bra is the straps:  they are flimsy stretch straps and very short.  i am petite and they are almost fully extended.  really, this is just an average bra but i am giving it 4 stars because it comes in my cup size -- so happy to not have to wear a wire every day!"
76581	thanks to this bra i can say goodbye to underwires forever! until i bought this bra i always wore underwires...until i got fed up with them. i have a small bust (b cup) so i don't need a lot of support but i do need shaping & most of the wirefree bras i tried in the past either had no shape themselves or flattened me out with their odd construction.this bra is like having underwires in my bra but without the any dreaded underwires. it tends to bend/fold at the sides (has no side boning whatsoever) so there isn't good support there, but it doesn't show bumps through fabric unless it's a very tight tshirt & there's no hardware to pinch or bruise delicate skin areas.it's not heavily padded but it's made of thin contoured foam that adds shape & fullness to a less-than-full bust & completely prevents nipple show-thru (this bra would work just as well without the added petal concealers you see inside the cups). the straps are very elastic (moves with your body) & adjustable from the front for easy access.nude is the best color for no show-thru under white fabrics. super-comfortable, easy to wash & care for, durable, & discreetly bust-enhancing, this is my favorite bra to wear most days. it's comfortable enough to sleep in (though i don't)!
76593	this is just what we needed for my son to keep his bible in.  he takes it with him every sunday to awana class.  good quality material and the zipper works well too.
76681	bought these for my 72yr . old mother _ she loves them! no more back pain, hip pain....  she wears them all the time!!!!
76696	"i have some cool turquoise sandals and was browsing the net, looking for a matching purse. i had no intention of buying a zebra print, but when i saw this one, i had to have it! even though the description says blue, it looked more turquoise to me, so i took a chance on it because i love the cheerful style and the shape.new blue large vicky zebra print faux leather satchel bag handbag pursearrived last week and i am more pleased than i dreamed i would be: the trim is turquoise--just a shade brighter than the shoes--so my gamble paid off. (it wasn't much of a gamble, since i could also carry this bag with black shoes. :-) but what really surprised and delighted me more than anything is the way it hangs--in cute little puckers that are hard to describe--and the material is something i've never seen before. it's faux leather, but has a rubbery texture that's quite pleasant to the touch and will be very easy to keep clean.all in all, it's a very attractive bag with a top zip closure, silver-tone hardware that complements the turquoise, just the right amount of interior pockets, and at 16w x 11h it has plenty of room for all my ""girly"" things, including my water bottle. all that and the price is right! what a bargain...as you can tell, i love, love, love my purse!reviewed by betty dravis, august 15, 2010author of ""dream reachers"" (with chase von) and other books"
76704	very nice.  i bought them for warmth...former ballet dancer and just love them for winter.  good choice all the way around.
76710	this is my second purchase from this company.  they are great. items received are exactly as described, fast shipping, packaged well.  good communication from seller when needed (that was my previous  purchase from them). will buy from them again.i would also like to add these warmers, both the short ones and the 28 inch ones, will stretch well to accommodate body part, then return to original shape once taken off.  in other words, they hold their shape well.
76811	the glasses i received do not look  like the picture. they are super cheap looking and the frames are almost see through. they are also narrower than standard wayfarers, so if you have a larger head or a wide face they will not look good on you.
76861	i bought this as a replacement for my husbands lost wedding ring and didnt want to spend much since this was the third time he'd lost one.  it came in a cute little box and is beautiful!  it looks like it costs much more and is classy but eye-catching.  my husband said it is very comfortable and true to size and he's already gotten many compliments.
76878	this ring is even better looking in person .. looking forward to doing more business. very fast shipping. i am very please this is the best product that i have ordered.
76942	i wish i had known that the product runs large, i would have bought at least one size smaller. it is beautiful and i wish my husband could wear it. i would have sent it back to get a different size but i gave it to my husband for christmas and it was my fault for picking too large a size.
76945	god bless the most beautiful creatures that are becoming increasingly artistic and more substantial in the future of this technology!
76968	i bought this ring for my fiance as a symbol of our commitment and i was very pleased with the ring upon arrival. it was too big for his ring finger, but he didn't want to return it and just decided to wear it on his middle finger. the tungsten is very sturdy and doesn't scratch and i bought this ring intended for durable wear and tear. it lasted about a full year but the carbide tarnished heavily and the design is barely noticeable now. i can't complain too much because of the great price and customer service. i just recommend knowing how to properly clean this kind of ring, or just getting a ring completely made of tungsten because it is a wonderful metal.
76972	i've been married for about a year and a half.  my original wedding band is a flat gold 5mm band.  i saw this ring and for $50 i just couldn't resist giving it a try.  i've liked it from the first day i wore it.  it is larger and much heavier than my original, but it has beveled edges so it wasn't uncomfortable even the first day i wore it.  (although if you are in the usa and remember february of 2010... take it off if you go outside to shovel snow... left me quite a callus after a few days of shoveling.)  it has so far proven very resilient, being tungsten carbide it seems to be very resistant to scratching.  overall i am very happy with the purchase.
76973	my husband waited many years to replace his 38 year old wedding band with a comfort band. he loves the look and feel of this ring. it's very smooth inside. pleased with our purchase.
77001	the beauty and detail and shininess of this ring can't even be described.  its so mirror-like that i'm going to need to use a microfiber cloth to keep the fingerprints off it.  the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars was that the top edges aren't rounded off or beveled at all.  its like the metal was just cut down the side with a laser, and its very sharp; not something that i'm looking for in a quality piece of jewelry.  however; if i were to get something even remotely similar to this in a jewelry store, i'd be paying 3 to 4 times as much at the least (let's be honest here; i'd be paying over $200 where i got this for $29.99 plus $6 shipping.)  the sharp edge is only enough to keep me from giving it 5 stars, but not enough to even remotely say i'm unhappy with the ring.  its almost perfect, and fit to size exactly.  good job metal masters!
77025	these shoes are pretty comfortable, but if you wear them without socks or some sort of stocking, they make your feet sweat and make squeeky sounds when you walk (foot rubs against the sole).  they are very cute, though.
77044	i bought one of these rings about a year ago. i loved how dainty and sparkly it looked while being made of literal steel to hold up to the many demands i place on it as a nurse. i bought the ring to wear to work instead of my wedding rings to avoid losing stones and carrying microorganisms in grooves. the one ring alone was sufficiently sparkly, but i wanted more width on my finger since i'm used to it from my wedding rings.a couple months after wearing the one stainless steel sparkle ring, which i loved by itself, i ordered another ring in the same size to stack on top of the first. together they are the same width as my wedding rings, so i feel that bulk and get tons of bling!this is the ultimate nursing ring!!! this ring is as tough as steel, and the sparkle doesn't ever fade. it cleans up well, the fit is so comfortable, the look is unbelievably classy, and the price is very reasonable. this ring can go anywhere, from working in the hospital to fancy dinners and weddings. i wear my stacked rings constantly.a couple things to note: these rings are not a bright color like sterling silver; it is slightly darker but is still quite bright. i really like the color of the rings because it is unique. the rings did feel a little rough at first, but in a couple weeks of wear they smoothed out.i am constantly complimented on these rings and get expressions of disbelief when i tell people what these rings are made of and how much they cost me. you will not regret this purchase.
77057	"this is a nice little ring, just doesn't have a ""wow"" quality about it.  i wish it sparkled more, but it's nicer than a plain silver band.  seems durable, and certainly understated if that's what i am in the mood for when choosing what jewelry to wear.  not sorry i purchased it, just don't love it."
77078	these pants were for my bf, who is a little over six feet tall and wears 33x36 pants.  these fit fine around the waist after being washed once--they do shrink--but are a couple inches too long.  had to hem up every pair.  he wears them doing sterilization in hospitals, lots of harsh chemicals.  they held up nicely and only were retired when they collected too many bleach spots.
77130	i was a little leary when i ordered this pill organizer.  i actually thought the zip lock pouches would have been a bit too small.  but, they are definitely large enough for all my meds and vitamins for morning and evening.  i like the fact that you can just pull the individual pouches out of the organizer and take them with you when you're out shopping, site seeing or simply going out to dinner and not having the need to take the entire organizer.  i don't see anyway to improve this product as it meets my needs just as it is.
77140	i must start by saying that this kimono is beautiful and it is a high quality robe.  i'm 5'5 and weight115 to 120 lbs and this robe is way too big on me.  i will keep it only because it is to much trouble forme to return it.  i will need to have it altered so that i can wear it on a cruise for pajama night, afterall i must say it is beautiful. i only wish that it came is different sizes so that i can buy more.
77203	i ordered this hoping to wear it to a costume party, they told me it had been shipped and they even provided a tracking number-however two days later i received an email stating that it was out of stock.  i am very disappointed as this looked so beautiful and i now have no costume and might not even be attending the halloween party anymore because of this.
77354	i love this shirt. it's kind of form fitting but not tight. in the pictures the sleeves look like cap sleeves and i was nervous about that but took the chance after someone's review said the sleeves were a bit longer. that's true. it just feels like kind of short short sleeves but not at all like cap sleeves.
77364	this is a nice blouse, but it is somewhat small and rides up over your boobs. it will not look like the picture shown.  is also over priced.
77480	i've had this for over 2 years. it was always a little crooked and wobbly but the real problem is that it's tarnishing my earrings. the colors and brightness of metals are dimming and the brightness of some stones are clouding. i'm going to try a black one maybe the paint finish wont do the same damage as the copper one does.
77495	definitely homemade, but i kind of like that about it. except for the fact that it stands crooked, of course; i had to put stuff under the legs to straighten it out. also it was much fatter and stubbier than i thought, it looks tall and thin in the picture, but is rounder and still tall. but i love it, once i put all my jewelry on it it looked gorgeous.and it spins! but it is very big, remember that.
77497	this is a gift.  my ....&#34;family&#34; member.... will love it.  shipped well packaged and delivery was quick. not exactly something i needed for myself though.i personally think it is ugly, but i am male and dont wear earings...
77501	i purchased this as a gift and it is really cute, appears to be well made and is more compact than i had pictured - but that is a good thing!  i think the person we are giving this to will really like this as she has tons of earrings and was looking for some way to organize them.
77527	i dinged it one star because of the time it took to figure out how to set the moon and tide.  i had to search reviews of this product to figure it out.
77558	sometimes it was a hassle to pull out a phone to check the time (especially while doing something), so i decided to purchase a rugged but stylish watch.  took about 15 minutes to become familiar with options.  i will be using this watch to keep time when riding motorcycle or at gun range.  i love it!
77575	this watch is great, but the package arrived much the worse for wear.  the watch itself was not damaged, but the item was a gift so i was embarrassed to see the box was in such terrible condition.
77620	first, the singlet is backwards on the picture shown, it's made to wear the other way around, and i wear my bra over it.  but i bet there will be times i want to wear it backwards, we'll see (it'd probably smash my boobs too much though).it whittled my waistline down and toned up my thighs and buns, without bra lines from the back view.i'd say the only real problem is the size of the flap in the crotch.  it should be larger to avoid having to take the singlet off entirely.  i will figure something out, perhaps some velcro, and a bit of sewing, or maybe just cut it off entirely.i like it well enough i just put another one in my shopping cart.
77626	i do not like the idea of bring your own bra! but the choices are getting smaller with respect to full body briefers. i purchased this in xl and i must admit it is not bad. i do prefer a full,  with bra,  briefer but this a great fall back.
77649	after five kids i needed a lot of support.  i tried this one on at kohls and loved it.  i ordered it from amazon because the price was a little better.  the support is great because it smooths you out from under your arm down and firmly supports your back, waist and stomach.  having the option of wearing your own bra is so great and makes wearing a girdle like this more comfortable.  the two things that i don't like about this girdle are the straps and the crotch.  the straps are narrow and after while dig into your shoulders and really hurt.  the straps should be a little wider since the girdle supports your whole torso.  the other thing is the crotch is great because it unfastens for convenience but it hooks right under your butt and makes going to the bathroom a pain.  i almost wet myself the first time i wore it trying to unhook it.  if it fastened closer to the front that would make this girdle a winner.
77857	very nice size, weight and craftsmanship make this an excellent gift.  the chain is a bit dainty, but fine for a woman.  there is an abundance of celtic/garnet jewelry in amazon, so it was simple to match this with a bracelet and earrings.  my girlfriend loved the set, which appears to be more expensive than it is.
77869	it's a nice pendant, however it it dirty and blackish in some areas. i'm gonna have to wash it myself to make it look like the picture. i am afraid to wear it because of the cheap chain it comes with. i get rashes if i don't wear silver and it defeats the purpose of purchasing a silver pendant if the chain is not silver also. it is not worth the $20 i spent on it. they should lower the price and take away the chain.
77877	fast shipping and the item is beautiful. you can't beat the price for this platinum overlay sterling silver cubic zirconia heart shaped and round bridal ring set. in addition, no one will expect that this set is not real.
77924	these are lovely and sizable earrings. the sapphires are dark, the gold plate is bright. they are big enough to be noticed. i really like the design. it packs a punch, for twenty something. you betcha.
77934	it was a present for my sis, and she loves fleur de lis.  she thought it would make a beautiful pendant as well.
77939	i realize there is an &#34;obesity epidemic&#34; in this country . . . but give me a break. these sweatpants are ridiculously huge. i read the reviews about how they would need to be hemmed, yes. but what about all of the extra material everywhere else? i'm 6'1&#34;, 185 lbs, with a 34&#34; inseam, and these pants fit me like my dad's pants did when i was 11 years old. the &#34;large&#34; size, which i ordered, would comfortably fit a man who is 6'5&#34;, 300 lbs.
77942	"fast delivery and excellent packaging.  item as described.  the problem is that they are too long.  i am about 5'5"" and the large is really long.  my daughter is taller than me so i will just give them to her.  i am going to buy another pair but i am going to purchase a medium instead of large."
77985	these are great. i will be using them to cosplay characters who wear glasses. the price was great too. i recommend them.
78018	these tops have been very good quality and fitted very well. my son wore them the 1st 3 months.washing didnt create any discolouration or shrinking. however, they should be washed in gentle cycles and dried on low heat else holes can appear on them.
78048	nice pants for work. i have to go to drug court and need to look nice but travel with a guide dog. these pants are not hair magnets.  the fit is a bit snug but they are comfortable and neat looking.
78069	"this micro umbrella by totes is compact for putting in your backpack or purse. when deployed, it is as big as a full-sized umbrella. i've had my totes micro umbrella for a few years and it's held up to strong winds and heavy rain. it may not be the the spring-loaded kind that opens up automatically with the press of a button, but it folds up very compact (approximately 8-3/4"" in length and 5-1/2"" in diameter). the craftsmanship is superb, from the stitching on the velcro strap and the canopy, to the skeletal frame and the telescoping handle - the quality is simply top-notch. the micro umbrella is, in sum, practical, well-made, durable, and *compact*. i'm extremely pleased with it. definitely recommended!"
78077	i purchased this item as i have small booties that i put on my dog's front paws before we walk due to her age and deteriorating paw pads and was recommended by my vet. however when the canvas top gets wet it soaked into her paw area and she would slip and then eventually throw off the bootie. i purchased this product to prevent the canvas from soaking in water, after twice coating her booties we went for a walk and they soaked in water just as before. a failed product in my eyes and a waste of money
78093	i love these earrings! i was so surprised to see these because i had a very low expectation when it comes to cubic zirconia products but these are amazing! it looks real and the facets it has aids with the shine, sparkle, & fire. i only gave it 4 stars because of the color...it is much lighter than pictured but i still love it; as long as you are ok with pale yellow then you're ok. the earrings are big for small/petite women but like myself, i don't mind it.
78094	you are not going to fool anyone into thinking these are real because of their size and brilliant color, but they are still absolutely gorgeous and worth every penny. they are shown perhaps one shade brighter yellow than they are in real life, however i would still consider them a bright canary yellow color. the backs fit well and they sit great on my ears which are a bit small. i do think i changed the earring backs to the circular clear plastic disks to make the earrings not droop because of their size.
78139	this solution worked well for me. i was able to line the inside of my oversized rings easily. i applied up to three layers using the nozzle to guide the gel over the lower area of the ring. one thing that was hard for me to understand was the instruction to keep the ring vertical for 24 hours after application of the gel. the gel is stiff enough for you to place the ring upside down resting on its top without having it run down the sides. so, i placed the ring with the stone side down on a soft cloth to protect the stone, which kept the ring in a vertical position. this let the get set and dry. i have not had any problems with the gel slipping off the ring. it works very well, and another side benefit is that the gel adheres a bit to your skin, so the ring doesn't twist around your finger either.
78151	ever since i got a pair for my husband in '07, i've been impressed with these shoes. i had a pair of classics but with the versitility of the ksos, i decided to upgrade. the color is fantastic- a turquoise blue & grey cammo & the fit is amazing! with delivery to my door in under 3 days, i couldn't be happier.
78461	seriously, these are that comfortable.  the only thing i wish they had are pockets, but i'm okay with wearing these because of the comfort.  by the way, i am 5'6&#34; and these are the perfect length to wear with flats or a very slight heel.
78480	a variety of colors at a very reasonable price. once i washed the bandanas they were very soft and comfortable.
78562	i love the ginger mary jane shoes made by croc.  i believe this style is discontinued and that is a shame.  though my foot is fairly wide, these adjust for a wider foot and still fit the medium foot.  (it might run loose on a narrow foot.)  i've nearly worn my first pair out, so when i saw these on amazon, i snapped them up.  i have other croc dressier shoes, but these are by far my favorites.
78601	i have purchase other similar looking pendants and this is on is just perfect. whereas other pendants are too big and some really tiny this one seems to be a perfect balance. the dragon is not so big that it's bulky and it just seems to sparkle. the only problem is the cord, which seems to be a bit too long and a little flimsy. however, that isn't something that would deter me from buying the pendant again since it is easy to replace the cord.
78604	i ordered these in red and blue.  they are very soft and i like that they can go over your knee or scrunched down.  bought these to wear with tights, leggins, skinny jeans.
78642	i love these robes. my fianc&eacute; bought me one and i bought him one for christmas. they are the coziest, best fitting, and comfortable robe ever. great for right out of the shower, and were perfect christmas morning!
78697	bought three of these....women's terry cloth bathrobe - ecovaganza (l/xl) - bamboo terry cloth plush robe for women - christmas gifts ideas presents women mom wife girlfriend xmas holiday gifts ideas 2011 - women's terry 0050 l/xl.....had a three girl spa day...myself my daughter and daughter in law!....i gave 4 stars because i feel they run a little small!~
78727	incredibly uncomfortable if you've ever worn a steve madden (the parent line) shoe. don't be tempted by the price or think that you're getting the same product just bc madden's in the name. you can get a sexy, patent leather, round toe in a higher quality, longer lasting, much more comfortable shoe from the steve madden line. i have a pair myself, which i love. the only reason i tried these is that i mistakenly thought the 7's i bought from steve madden ran too large, bc they slip off the back of my heel when i wear them when hose. so i tried this shoe in both a 7 and a 6 1/2. now i'm figuring out that while i wear a size 7 sneaker, i need a wider but smaller size for dress styles.bottom line. i'm not really a fan. these, unfortunately, had to go back.
78728	very cute and stylish shoe. can be worn with dress or slacks. true to size. just what i was looking for...not too much of a heel but perfect heel size wide enough that you can actually walk in them!
78735	i have other madden girl shoes, and was looking for something that was still a little stylish, but easy on my feet. these shoes fit very well and the heel is tall enough for pants/jeans, but low enough that you can wear all day without feeling the leg fatigue that higher heels can cause.
78937	it's a nice piece of jewlery. however, the chain is so small i dont know how it didnt beak while in transit. the writing it's self is so small that i (20/20 vision) had a extremely hard time reading it becuase of the size and how it is engraved looping around the heart. also the clamp is very small and very hard to pull back. all in all its a nice looking almost impossible to put on or read piece of fake jewlery.
78987	"aside from being a beautiful cover-up...this product is the perfect material for your beach bag! it's 100% rayon, so it's sheer, and airy, but also-it doesn't wrinkle! i'm sick of pulling my cotton cover-ups out of my beach bag and having to walk around looking like i've slept in them for 3 days! this is a lovely, sexy piece...it's got stitching detail in all the right places, and a couple sparkles thrown in too. like any other, ""cover up"" piece, you can't expect it to hold up like a custom-tailored piece of alexander mcqueen couture, but it's definitely worth $30."
79089	bought these with a 20% off coupon. they were too small, even though order the same size i always wear. the coupon was one-time use only and not replaceable so i end up buying a competing brand at sam's club where regular price was about the same as these.
79120	these dockers pants are fantastic!! fit well and feel good wearing all day. the best part is just throw them into the wash and you could wear them out of the dryer. well, i run my iron quickly on them, and they look awesome.
79244	i was interested in this sort of a heel when mbt first came out, but decided to wait and see if the price would come down.  i was thankful to see skechers, a brand that i trust.  ordered two pair, white for work (i am a nurse) and the black for casual wear.  they are cushioney, great for long walks and a great buy!
79313	i ordered the purple version and it was not as pretty as the picture portrayed.  the front was very scratched up with several hairline scratches that were noticeable in bright light.  the chain is thin and short - i bought a more substantial one since this was a gift.  i give it 3 stars because it's a great concept and others seemed to like it more than i did.
79374	cozy and comfortable pants for lounging. the xl ran a little tall for me at 6'3&#34;, but are still a good fit. fabric is soft and stretchable. would recommend.
79410	i ordered 2 pairs.  one came with no button hole.  it had the metal clasp, the button, but no hole not even the sticking for the hole.  the second pair came with no metal clasp and with the button on the wrong side.  since i had them i decided to try them on.  now, i own 2 pairs of these exact pants that about 10 years old.  both d3 pants were too tight through the seat and thigh.  i had to laugh.  it couldn't get much worse.  i checked the labels and they were labeled correctly as d3.
79523	nice bag alot of pockets but very heavy i also didnt care for the tag that stated it was made from materials that cause cancer had i known in advance i would not have purchased
79582	i was done going through another pair of expensive sun glasses as they would quickly get scratched up or lost. i read some reviews and opted for a couple pairs of these. i have a small head and these fit perfectly. the nose guard is not tight and they hug my face and keep the light out when i am driving.
79599	i just received the earrings yesterday. love them! just enough sparkle and sophistication to add to any outfit. they are quite small though. for some reason i expected them to be bigger (and yes, i know there are measurements listed). but overall i really do like them. we'll see how they hold up over time.
79652	i usually wear an xxl shirt, but this shirt fits me like a curtain. it's the right length as far as longwise, but xxl means really, really overweight. the fabric is awesome, cool, and comfortable.
79672	i have 3 of these  little belts.  they are great for closing the gap of your pants, particularly in the back area, and vanish underneath any shirt.  no bulky belt buckle to ruin clean lines of a silhouette.  i found this particular brand to be better than the similar invisibelt, as this is softer and more maleable.  the invisibelt is very stiff plastic and was actually cutting into my skin at times.  this brand is much more comfortable.
79710	my niece loved this piece and she says it will remind of that we are always protecting her and making sure that she has things that we consider will keep her safe.
79724	bought this as a surprise gift for christmas.  bracelet matched wedding perfectly.  he appreciated the link's different style than a traditional link bracelet or id bracelet.  bracelet is high polished for a clean, shiny look.
79726	i really like them. they feel nice and everything, but i got the wrong color. i had thought i ordered black, but i guess i accidentally ordered white. i will be buying them again in black this time.
79797	i got this for my husband. he needed a sun hat but i didn't want to get him one of those canvas fisherman hats, and i needed something crushable (i.e. not a straw hat) because he's hard on things. my husband is an attractive guy but this transformed him into a total dork. in his words, &#34;it's the worst kind of hat, because it looks like it could be cool but it's just not quite there. you'd be better off just going for a nerdy hat and making it look cool.&#34; he asked me to return it. so there you have it.
79799	i think this is a very cool looking hat. i like the look and material. mine is a bit too big but not enough to send back. i was between a medium and large and went with large. medium probably would be better but it will do.
79820	i bought this hat to replace an old and dead hat for a camping trip in the canyonlands of utah.  it's a great hat!  like some others have said... the sizes run huge!  i have a big noggin, so i ordered the extra-large... it was too big.  they were great about replacing it with the next size down which fits me perfectly.pros:- easily shapable- crushable!- stylish- keeps the sun of face, eyes, and neckcons:- sizes run large- in hot weather your head will be hotter.dorfman-pacific weathered cotton outback hat with chin cord
79881	was so happy to get these boots, i had been looking at them for some time.  i enjoy wearing them
79915	these are very comfy but not the prettiest.  i did not buy them for their looks tho so that is ok
79916	i give it 4 stars though because they are so comfortable especially after a long night at work on my feet. i work in a restaurant
79943	"the only reason i gave this four stars instead of 5 is personal preference. i prefer a little longer leg length in my shorts. otherwise these fit perfectly and don't ride up into ""wedgieville"" after a while which says a lot about how well they are made. the waistband is very comfortable. the pouch holds up well giving security without sacrficing comfort."
79958	this bra i very comfortable. it has enough support to suit my needs. i washed it on the delicate cycle and let it air dry.
80035	this worked great as a coverup and is pretty, material is thin and breathable so if it gets wet it dries pretty quickly.however i was hoping that it might work well as a dress and it doesn't because it is saggy in the front and falls open easily as well as droops pretty low in the back.but i love how it's easy to put on and crosses over, different but pretty!
80087	i love this ring.  it is perfect for every day casual wear.  i am now shopping for my next piece of jewelry.
80208	i love the styling of these pumps. they look great with dress slacks or skirts for work. i am quite pleased with them.
80255	i bought two pairs in smaller sizes.  i read other reviews that said ballet shoes should be sized about two sizes below what you normally wear.  i did that and the shoes was definitely too small.  thanks to amazon's free returns i ordered a larger size which was also too small.  i finally just ordered a pair in my normal size and they fit great.  they're comfortable and perform exactly as they should.  at least as far as this brand/model goes - order your normal size and you should be good.
80263	these ballet shoes are not comfortable. i got them just to wear around the house... for lightweight summer slippers. seriously i could not imagine dancing in them. now, perhaps in ballet class you are supposed to be in pain-- i don't know. the length of the slipper was fine and true to size. it is the toe box area that just kills my feet. i do not have wide feet at all, i have to cinch up the strings pretty tightly to get them to stay on. i'm trying to break them in by wearing them a little at a time but i'm not sure i can handle it. so, bottom line-- if you are a dancer and slippers are supposed to hurt your feet, then these are probably exactly what you are expecting. otherwise, i cannot recommend them.
80301	i followed recommendations from others who reviewed this product before me and ordered one size bigger. i didn't regret my decision. those shoes fit perfectly and they are very comfortable. definitely well worth the money and a great purchase for someone who just started.
80318	these were probably about my 15th or 20th pair of capezios, but they were my first t-straps and my first online shoe purchase. i was a little worried that the leather on the toe box would be soft and prone to wrinkling like their footlights but not at all. the leather is smooth and firm. they are true to capezio's sizing, so if you fit a 7 in any other capizio you'll fit a 7 in these. my high insteps don't affect the line of the shoe at all. the soles are the same as the footlights, scored across the toe and ball with nailed heels. when these wear out, i will be happily buying another pair. these are my new favorite formal dance shoes.
80330	"i returned these shoes as they were not comfortable. i tried them for zumba, and there is no cushion and they slip on and are not adjustable.  i got some capezio dance sneakers called ""fierce"" from amazon.com, and they are much better. they lace up and actually have some cushioning, other than in the center which has nothing but is tight fighting for support."
80336	let's clarify something, i'd bought the size l because i'd read a lot of review and the said that the costume was too small, well in my case i'd bought the: super mario brothers, deluxe mario costume, large, and it is relly, really big, i had to pay a taylor to reduce the size of the costume..... putting all that aside i must said: it's a great experience, my son adores this costume, this has it all: hat; gloves, mustache and inflatable belly, he wore them all, ... if your son loves mario what are you waiting for? buy it!!! i can't really describe with words how much he loves to wears this costume, i higly recomendend the costume, very good made and quality!!! also i must said: amazom has the best price, good for them!!!!
80415	i have four self winding (also known as automatic)wrist watches and i have two double diplomat watch winders that i purchased from amazon. they work particularly well to keep the time and other functions working, and somewhat accurate when i choose to wear one of the four. normally i may have to reset the watch by a few minutes depending how long it has been on the diplomat and not worn. but, this is a far cry easier than having to reset each function on each of the watches. i set the timers, on the two diplomats, to run one hour and rest for three hours and i can forget them until i'm ready to choose to wear one or another according to the event i'll be attending. i love watches and all of my watches are what i refer to as affordable...nothing extravagant or expensive.... i have been very happy with the diplomat watch winders to keep me ready to put on any one of my automatic watches at anytime.sms
80421	omg cute, cute, cute, this skirt is so cute i love it.  i even pulled it up like a tube top and wore it like a summer dress.  i got alot of compliments.  and my shipping was so so about a week and a half.;@  but the skirt is really cute.:)
80426	i am 5'8&#34; and the length was perfect.  i bought this skirt in black and white for a girls trip to mexico.  my girlfriends and i took turns wearing them.  we all loved both of them so much.  they are slightly sheer so be prepared for that, but they look great!
80467	they are nicely made slippers.  i wear normally a street shoe size 8 and ordered 8m and too large.  they were slipping off my feet.  i think a 7m would have been too small.  perhaps putting in an insert or wearing socks would work.  i didn't want to do that.  i am returning them.
80594	like the other boots in this range.with the passage of time, the part that connects the cell becomes looser and the charging process becomes increasingly poor.
80619	very cute shoes. comfortable and fit as expected. will look cute with cropped dress pants for the office. yay shoes.
80693	i have not worn it cause technically i am not supposed to have it til saturday.  i only bought this ring because the engraved ring i ordered will not even ship until after our 25th anniversary renewal.  so i needed something nice looking but cheap since i bought a ring.  the box it came in is so awesome.  it looks nicer than the diamond ring we bought 13 years ago.  it is so shiny.  i do not know how it will hold up with lots of wear but so far i love it.  can't wait to wear it.
80694	this ring was very beautiful and sparkly and i so love the design. however, the center stone was smaller than i thought it would be, so i gave it to my aunt and she loves it. center stone is probably 3/4 carat in diamond equivalent.
80695	if your young and starting to think of marriage, start it out right. forget a diamond you'll worry about. put the money toward a house or a car and get this ring. cute, elegant, believable as a diamond and a nice unexpected elegance to the design.i recommend it highly. :o)
80703	this is really a nice piece of jewelery it fits well and shines like a real diamond very very nice
80708	i brought a size 5 for my wife and she loves it!she thought it was real until i stopped her from taking it to the jeweler to have it cleaned.this is a great started ring for those on a budget.best way to clean this ring and to keep it shiny is with a mild soap and peroxide mix.i would recommend this ring set to others.
80830	first quality!needed wide slippers, and this was the best choice.the rubber sole is ideal if you have to go outside to pick the newspaper, plus it does not wear out due to friction in carpeted indoor areas.a little stiff at first, but very comfortable after a few days.
80868	just a note, size up when you order these. i love teva sandals and went by the pair i have and these were too small!!! i sent them back for the 8 and they were perfect. they are so comfortable!!!
80902	i have been buying these shoes for about 8 or 9 years now and every pair i have had from eastland has been great quality and comfortable.  until the open road design i just got and had to send back.  these are very attractive.  however the elastic inserts that i always look for in there shoes were worthless in this particular style because there is stitching around the strap and buckle that renders the elastic useless.  they do not stretch at all to fit over your foot while trying to put them on.  the top of the shoe is quite high, which is very attractive but you need some give in order to slip them on and there is no give.  i could barely get one shoe on and that without a sock,  the other i could not get on at all.  very disappointing.  so back they go.
80921	i would recommend these shoes to anybody. they are wonderful for walking.you will feel the difference as soon as you take the first step.don't let the price be a factor in your decision, they are worth every dime. you can't put a price on comfort.try them, you will love them like i do.sincerely, ida eardley
80926	these shoes are very comfortable, and look nice (they make your feet look smaller, that's good),  but lately my knees are a little sore; ican't say with certainty it's the shoes.  i will stop wearing them and see if there's relief, if not, i might have to admit that i might be getting older.
80970	"it's kind of cheap but what else could i expect for what i paid for it.  my boss was retiring from the army and bought a boat for he and his family to enjoy.  so for the informal part of his farewell we went with a boating theme.  this was one of many ""gag"" gifts we got for him.  like i said, it served the purpose and with my amazon prime membership, i got it in 2 days, love the prime."
80979	not a bad shoe, the decorative details are painted on but the insole comes out for wifes orthotic brace so she wears them and they look nice.
81004	i use this asics long sleeve athletic shirt for running.  this shirt is nice and soft but i feel that the fabric is a little too thin.  the plus side of being thin is that it is extremely lightweight.  the size runs a little big.  i have a 41 inch chest and weigh 180 lbs, the large was way too big for me.  i normally get workout shirts in a size large but i think i might have been better off getting this one in a medium.  a word of warning, do not let velcro touch this shirt!  it will damage the shirt.  i threw my weightlifting gloves inside my gym bag and the velcro damage to my shirt.  nothing bad but just thought i'd mention it.pros:lightweightgood moisture controlcons:size runs big.  get one size under your normal shirt size.a little too thin
81048	cute color scheme and cute monkey design. fits as expected. seems to run true to size and is well made for the price.
81100	very pretty, bought this to wear over a dress and it was perfect. was a cool evening. needed just a little something for warmth.
81116	but....i am not a 44d, i am a 38d and had to go through several of these and return a lot of them before i got the right one, so beware, they do run small, and still with 44d you still get the muffin bottom, i ended up going on ebay and getting one that goes down to my waist and i don't have that going on with that one, it ended up costing me more, but in the end was way worth it.
81166	my husband wears these for work in the field (construction). they hold up okay for the price. he can usually get about a year out of a pair before holes in the knees develop.  he is pretty hard on his work clothes. this color for some reason runs a size smaller than the lighter brown and tan ones.  he wears a 34 x 32 in these and 32 x 32 in the other colors.
81171	great costume for the price. pretty thick white fabric, sturdy straps. pretty flattering. i am 5'6&#34; 130 lbs and a m was a little big (but they were out of s. would have gotten a s). pretty long, slight train in the back.fyi you can't wear a bra or undies with this without it being very visible. there is just a 2&#34; strap that ties in the back. very sexy but hard to wear for busty girls. i wore a bikini top and nude boyshorts and it was perfect!
81185	well, they stick with body heat. this means that you can successfully wear these with thin bras and fitting tight shirts without. however, they can and will fall off if worn under a loose shirt. if you do not wear a bra and your fitted/tight shirt isn't thick enough, you'll get the 'large areola' issue- the outline of the concealers are noticeable. i feel like i'm doing a lot better letting my chest grow naturally without being constricted by padded bras, but no- i can't just wear a baby tee with no bra and get away with it.
81219	thick, durable, good-looking band.  corners and edges on the buckle are smooth, stitching is tight, an excellent value.  doesn't come with pins though, so you should remember to order some of those along with it.  makes me wish i'd replaced my old one years ago.
81238	i compare this jacket to others i have owned. they have all done an admirable job of protecting the wearer from rain, even downpours, without complication. this one is no exception. it tends to run larger in the body. pockets are where you expect them and closures work pretty well. this is the first jacket i've owned with venting. it seems to help keep me more comfortable during warmer temps.
81254	these (and the no wedgies ones) are the best underwear i have owned.  they do not pinch or ride up.  i bought a bunch and then threw out my others.  these are a winner!
81356	i bought these for my 10 year old granddaughter for a christmas present. she has an older pair that i bought for her just like these, only with the white stripe. i thought she liked them because of their looks, but she told me it was because they feel so comfortable.
81452	very lovely and easy to change out colors. the earrings just snap closed-very easy. purple and aurora boreale are my favorite colors of these and i often wear two together on the hoops. the drops are big enough so you can see them with my hair down, and they seem sturdy and not too delicate so they should last. nice value too.
81461	these are a replacement for another pair of asics that i wore out. these shoes are great, even though the insole comes out unlike other versions. i was able to wear these on a long walk without pain or discomfort. the break in period was very short & they are comfortable as the others i have. one word of caution is that i would not run in these. they do not feel like my running versions, but are great for walking. i love the asics line, and will continue buying their shoes. this is another great pair.
81510	great poncho!  arrived just in time  we had a downpour yesterday and i had to run outside for a little yard cleanup that i hadn't quite finished.  kept me dry and comfy.  this one is going to go in the car, will be ordering another one for home.  love the lightness, but it still feels sturdy not like a plastic bag.  great poncho, great price.
81554	i have purchased several pool-sport slides trying to find a pair that can get soaked and then dry quickly. these are the best so far. others have spongy material that takes hours to dry out. otherwise they are not special and overpriced for a hunk of asian-made rubber.
81576	cute hat and very warm!  excellent purchase for the price!  carhartt makes a great winter hat and the pink color is very girly.
81618	these are inexpensive and shipped quickly. and since i got twice as much for a quarter of the price, i have to say that it was worth it. great for inexpensive giveaways at my party.
81622	i ordered these to use in a play i directed - good thing there were a lot. the paint came off and the strings broke very easily. not the best, but worked for a few minutes onstage
81627	excellent product, the sherpa liner is makes the vest a keeper. recommend purchase for anyone who likes wearing a vest.
81673	gets kind of tangly with everything, and messy- but so are all synthetic wigs, i guess.it's nice for the purpose.
81694	i have been using these speedo swimsuits for almost a year and, for the most part, i have been fairly happy with the quality. i swim 4-5 times a week anywhere from 70-90 laps in either a fresh water pool or a regular chlorine pool at the fitness center. three pairs of these suits have held up well for a year, till they gradually started shredding at the seams only recently. given the extensive use, i have absolutely no problem with the wear, glad they lasted a year.as other folks have mentioned, you definitely want to order a size up. i am a 31 waist and ordered a 34, perfect fit around the waist and above the knee. thank you to the previous reviewers for this tip. the stitching is of good quality in that it doesn't dig into the skin. it's comfortable to wear and looks decent. i spin it dry after each use and also make sure to throw it in the wash after each wear, and then hang dry. do not put these in the dryer because that will cause the fabric to shred after a few washes.the reason i give this 4 stars is because the material is not exactly top quality. i mean it feels somewhat like a compression short, but then not really. the fabric is just a tad thick to be good quality jammer material. as a result, the fit around the crotch area is not a hundred percent perfect, it bunches up just a little bit to require adjusting each time you stop in the middle of laps, or get out of the pool. it's just a little loose, and this is not because of the fit but because of the material.i thought of trying something different this time and orderedtyr men's starship jammer swim suit. i have been using this one for a little over a month now and the difference in quality is significantly noticeable! the tyr suit fabric is of much better quality. as a result, it feels truly like a compression suit. the string going through at the waist is also more flat, making it much more comfortable to wear and keeping a leaner look. because the material is thinner, it dries much quicker as well. it has a second lining around the crotch area which actually makes it more comfortable to wear, and it doesn't bunch up like the speedo. and the best part is that it was for $35 or so, cheaper than the speedo! already ordered two more pairs of the tyr, and will be sticking with them for the time being.
81763	my hubby is fairly hard on his work clothes.  they wear out quick, and often, we spend the extra in hopes that they last and provide comfort longer. he's on his feet for 12 hour shifts, so this is vital. when i first bought these socks, over a year ago, i was skeptical.  they're cheaper than a lot of the other brands per pair, and they're not from a major player like dickie's or other workwear names.  but i'm so glad we tried them.after a year, these socks are still going.  they haven't flattened out, worn thin, or gotten so funk-ified that they can't be used (like other socks did).  they still offer good cushion for his steel toed boots, and he has never complained about the comfort lacking.in fact, the only reason i bought another bag recently?  all the other brands of work socks are pretty much rags.  now, these are the only ones in the drawer. give them a try, they may surprise you, too!
81821	i've been using these sunglasses for several months in san diego sunlight. i wear prescription glasses for driving and another pair for reading on the patio. these will fit over normal-sized glasses by way of the upper recessed rim. the only suggestion to the manufacturer i have is that they place some type of clip in the center, behind the frame -- so we can clip the hd vision sunglasses to the underlying pair of prescription glasses. there is some shifting of the seated pairs of glasses when moving around vigorously. these are not for sporting activity, water-skiing or mountain climbing. they hang low on your face without an underlying, [normal sized] set of glasses underneath to lift up the bridge on your nose. these are for walking, sitting and driving (with your glasses on underneath them) and they do that very well. i gave a set of these to an elderly couple i know recently. they are amazed how pleasant it is to take a walk in the sun and still be able to wear their prescription glasses - for the first time in their lives.
81833	love the style, love its materials made, it came exactly fit, feels good & comfy, running for half an hour & it comforts my feet well.
81847	really attractive cluster of rainbow colored crystals although the stones are a bit larger in size than i imagined. couldn't use the chain; it's cheap and detracts from the crystal. too much trouble to send this back so i put this on a better quality chain with some sparkle to it as well and it's turned out to be quite nice. also worthy of noting: just as another reviewer reported, there's a mysterious and distracting 'extra ring' at the top of the cluster that droops over the crystals.  has no purpose so i simply cut it off with wire cutters. it has turned out to be something really nice for my granddaughter but only because i took the time to make it so, i frankly wouldn't invest in this again had i seen it in a store; too much trouble to make it work out.
81927	am a long-legged tall gal who has put on quite a few pounds. these tights fit beautifully, stay in place, and after several washings in cold water and wearings are pill and pull free. nice purchase.
81931	these boots are very cute, and i like that they lace up so it is easy to adjust calf size. however i would not recommend them for anything more than slight costume use, as the heals on both boots blew out rather quickly from repeated use.
81974	up in alaska we have looooong winters.  the kids need tough, durable boots since school's continue to have recess even in sub-zero weather.  with growing children it is a yearly frustration for me to find affordable winter items.  i have always had a preference for sorels but they cost so much in our local stores.  these boots were very reasonably priced and shipped quickly up here.  they are a bit big since 1/2 sizes were not available but once my son is in thick wool socks i think it will be fine.  very happy!
82014	"i am outside continually, whether it's exercising, working in the yard or walking my dogs.  i live near a river which we call the ""mosquito coast"", along with big black flies, moths, gnats and a huge host of ""no see-ums.""  when i wear this shirt, along with the insect shield baseball cap, the bugs just stay away and i have not been bitten yet.  i hand wash the shirts and air dry as they are easy to maintain.  i bought a few of these shirts to make sure that a shirt is always ready to use.  i have an autoimmune illness which makes me extremely worried about bug bites and i won't take any chances by not wearing this shirt.  this item works very well for me and it is also very good to wear to bed."
82015	but, it does not breath......wore it hiking and sweat like a pig, but no bugs...hmmm....is it a fair trade???  i'd recommend this anyway
82051	these are the worst flats to walk in! i own several flats but these are bar none the most aweful! when i wear them i can feel everything under my feet (e.g. pebbles, sticks). there is absolutely no padding. they are so bad that i keep them under my desk at work and wear them only inside if i need a break from my heels. don't buy these if you expect to do a lot of outdoor walking in them.
82056	reading the other reviews made me get the smaller size, which i now regret - i usually wear a 7 if it is wide, and got this in a 7. but, it is tight and not comfortable to wear for long - its not just the width that is tight, but also the length. but, because the leather is quite soft, i am hoping that it will stretch, if i can get myself to wear it more! i also got the same shoe in 7 and a half for my growing daughter - fits me nicely, but, again, on the tight side for my daughter(who is between and 7 and a half and an 8)
82058	i ordered a 10 and had to exchange them for a 9.5...if you are, like me, between the sizes, get the smaller one. the shoes are also wide and they stretch, so get a half a size smaller. my shoes developed a diagonal &#34;crease&#34; or a wrinkle going from my big toe towards the middle. not sure what caused it...my other shoes never did that. the wrinkle appeared after the first day of wearing them. i did not care much...they are soft and real leather, and that's all that mattered.i got the color black and it is not pitch black but a light black. i would love for them to be pitch black, otherwise, they look a bit like fake leather.
82085	i bought this as a christmas gift for my grandson.  it is a nice weight - not intended for work.  great style and true to size. my grandson loved it.
82156	my son has owned several of these hats and always requests these for christmas. the hat must be black and have a visor. he says they keep his head very warm. i like that they don't cost much and the quality seems to be very good. i'll continue to purchase carhartt products for the men in my life.
82175	i purchased this hat as a gift for my son who had been wearing a similar hat for several years...and it has really started to look bad.  the new hat performs as well as the hat he had been wearing, which was quite a bit more expensive.  he liikes the hat.
82177	i buy a lot at amazon because of the great deals.. this hat was fantastic, great price fantastic quality. the store that it came from shipped it to me and i had it within 3 days. the service is pure please.  you have to pay special attention to the size measurement of your head to get the proper fit.
82208	bought this jacket to withstand the cold weather and to my surprise i can even wear them loosely on regular days. the material and fabric is definitely rugged and well built to last a good while. i particularly like the pockets located both on the outside and inside of the jacket as they are deep and placed just right. the cuffs around the wrist are designed in such a way that they are inside and do not allow the cold to get in. i got brown colour which looks good and the sanded duck material plus the sherpa lining accentuates the jacket overall.
82212	carhartt tends to fit big the the medium works great for me.  i am borderline large in the shoulders and medium waist, and it fits perfect.  the hood is nice, but carhartt's duck material is stiff so don't expect it to form nicely to your head.  this should last for years!
82223	this is a heavy, well made, work coat. i have used it several times in freezing temperatures and it always does its job.
82276	felt so light and comfortable even for a padded bra but it had nice details and i hope it washes well.
82312	"i went on a ""lounge pant"" shopping binge last week and purchased 5 different pairs of pants - between these, champion men's sweatpants, and a pair of puma pants.these are by far my favorite.  they are not sweatpants at all.  there is nothing fleece like about these.  they are a stretch material, but much heavier than your typical stretchy leggings or yoga pants.  that, along with a nice boot cut, makes these almost passable for a casual workplace.  if you wear a long sweater, then unless someone inspects these closely, they could look like regular black pants.  but they are so so so comfortable.i would definitely wear these out for casual shopping.  and i would not wear yoga pants or sweatpants for the same thing.  but these are just as comfortable if not more comfortable than those options.love love love.  going to buy 2 more pair."
82317	i absolutely love these; they are the most comfortable sandals i have had. also love it that i can wash them so easily.
82324	"the shoulder strap drop is 9.25""the handle (the retractable handle) has 20"" dropthe wheels are hard plastic and very noisythe bag itself is a good size and useful for walking to grocery store and back"
82425	i would not like this style in plain black, brown, etc. the reason i love them is the multi-color with the brown lizard look leather. they fit like a dream, the leather is quality and beautiful. i got a great deal on them here at amazon, where i buy all my shoes, but they went down 12 bucks by the time they arrived so i called and got the refund! so i would only recommend this style in this color combination and this is the only place i saw the brandy/tan/brown shoe at....amazon.com
82593	i really like this shirt. the color is pretty, it is lightweight (definately a tank underneath) and goes cute with jeans. but, it fits more snug than i'd like (especially needing to put something underneath since it is thin and kind of see through).
82661	looks fine at a glance, a closer look reveals that the carbon fiber pattern is a bit off at an angle which is particularly noticeable on the top (which is how pretty much anyone is going to see it). not a deal breaker for me and my collection, but it does cheapen the look of the craftsmanship. the pillows/stitching are all fine and my latch/lock seem to work fine, which was my concern after seeing other reviews but giving it a chance regardless. it is nice and deep with large pillows - my diving/other larger watches that made my last case lid stand up a bit isn't a problem with this case. i might actually get another one so i have two that match when my collection grows a bit more.
82678	i purchased this item as a gift for my husband. he absolutely loves it. the quality of it is perfect inside and out. it holds all of his watches of different sizes with room to grow (sigh). the display of it please him when he shows his watch collection to other enthusiast. it is not out of place in our walk-in closet decor.
82682	these sunglasses are perfect.  i needed to find very large fitovers to go over my new trendy glasses.  i did not want them to look like they belong to an old lady.  these glasses are stylish, as well as very effective.  they allow great side vision.
82694	i found my first pair of savane pants at my local sam's club a few years ago.  they are the most comfortable, best fitting pair of pants i have ever owned.  the twill pants that i purchased from amazon are a different fabric than my most favorite pair, but i think i've found the fabric from my first pair and they are on the way.i'm a financial professional and spend a lot of time at my desk.  for this reason, these savane twill pants tend to wrinkle and hold the wrinkles from the crotch to the bottoms of my from pockets.  the rest of the pants do come out of the washer very wrinkle free.  the expanding waist is perfect and keeps the pants comfortable through the ups and downs in my weight.  the twill fabric is not as dressy as some others, but is acceptable with a dress shirt or as work casual.  fanny and crotch room is ample in my size, 42x32, and the inseam is pretty consistent so i can feel ok about buying online without the opportunity to try them on.
82859	this was a great solution for me, as i wanted my rings stored in a way that i could easily see each one. the only issue i have is that it actually gets &#34;dusty&#34; inside the box. it has a velvet like &#34;cushion&#34; that holds the rings. when i open the box, the dust in the air clings to the cushion immediately. honestly, it is practically a dust magnet. other than, it does the basic job i purchased it for and provides nice ring storage.
82866	exactly as shown, it does have cheap foam on the inside, the box itself is pretty sturdy. it serves it's purpose for jewelry i am trying to sell.
82888	i like these pants, but they tend to be cut a bit in the low waist style. if you're high waisted, you'll find yourself trying to pull them up all the time. they are very comfortable to wear and except for the one item above, i very glad i brought them.
82890	these pants fit perfectly. the added hidden stretchable sides keep the pants snug yet comfortable while bending. they look good and feel good. just wish they had more colors to choose from.
83040	i don't think i could ever &#34;love&#34; socks, thus the 4-star rating.  these are pretty good quality.  they aren't as thin and as cheap as i thought they would be (for the price).  they have some padding, which is nice...not a lot, but i was surprised they had padding at all.  if you don't need a special sock (moisture control, heavily padded, etc.), i'd heartily recommend these.  at this price, you can buy gobs of them and throw out all your old socks that take you a half hour to find the matches for.
83078	these shoes are so comfortable and they are light, so you feel like you aren't wearing any shoes.  love them!  i get compliments on them every time i wear them.
83105	i have two of these wraps,i'm 5'9 and 133 pounds and i got a small, and it fits fine.i have one in black, one in white.the black one has held up remarkably well, minimal color fading and almost no pilling. a perfect, zero maintenance garment that can be worn all year long. i use benzoyl peroxide on my back in the summertime, and there was almost zero bleaching effect from the wrap touching my bare, sweating skin...you can barely tell any bleaching from the wrong side of the garment and not at all from the right side. that is a miracle, you have no idea how many good shirts i go through in the texas summers due to that bleaching effect. i try to hand wash it, but otherwise i toss it in with my darks in a lingere bag. i lay it out to dry it unless i'm in a hurry.all in all, this wrap in black is one of the most versatile, highest quality, perfect items i have ever adorned my body with. i recommend it highly.my wrap in white however, not so much. after the first wear, it was showing tiny little holes, in random places. i stitched them up, which worked, but what a pain! the seams on the shoulder are loose and look like they may fall apart. there is a big gap now between the sleeve and the shoulder, attached only by loosely woven threads. and of course its white, so there are now stains under the arms from sweating. the fabric is more delicate and started to pill and show wear within a few wearings. its still wearable, but if i had purchased this one first i would not of bought another.i am so impressed with the quality of my initial purchase...the black wrap...that i have to give this 4 stars. but i take one off of 5 for the white one being so disappointing.
83120	the brooks glycerin 8 has been out for awhile. it's the first shoe to incorporate the new dna technology also found in the trance 10 and beast/ariel models as well. the shoe looks great. brooks pays attention to detail and just holding on shoe in your hand you begin to see all the small detailing incorporated into this running shoe. this is their top of the line for neutral runners. i'm a bit spoiled as the trance 10 which is their top of the line shoe in any category has a bit more cushioning and stability. i generally have a neutral gait. however i weigh about 240 lbs and the extra cushioning in the trance 10 just feels better to me. the glycerin 9 will likely be out later this year and likely will add some cushioning and stability and make it a contender as the best neutral running shoe made. i did not want to wait for the 9th edition. again i have other reviews on asics , nike and new balance running shoes. it's nice to have the dna technology in this shoe but it's a bit overhyped. no better than asics gel technology which has been out for years. i still prefer the asics gel kayano 17 over all other running shoes at any price. but i really like this shoe. it's got decent cushioning and good energy return. your foot feels closer to the ground than with the asics. this shoe required a 4 mile run to get them broken in. at first the heel well felt like its was creating friction on my foot and there were some other little minor irritations on the front end of the shoe as well. after the 4 mile run i felt none of it. the shoe adapted perfectly. heel cup is good and no issues on the front end. the upper materials are the best on any shoe i own. the midsole provides good shock absorption and compliments the dna gel like material. it feels as though your being propelled forward as you run. unless you have a significant pronation problem you really can't go wrong with this shoe. brooks is doing their homework and putting out top line running shoes with well researched technology. i highly recommend this shoe. i took out the stock insole and put in a sole dean karnanze signature footbed as i do with all my running shoes. i believe this shoe will last a good long time. sizing was not a problem. i always buy 1/2 size larger and the 2e width. bottom line this shoe is well worth the money. i can't wait for the glycerin 9 but for now i'm quite pleased with the 8.
83183	we travel to our place in central america 4 to 5 times peryear and are always taking things down.  airlines give us 50lbs per bag and two bags per person.  we bring very little back.  i bought two of this size and two of the next larger size 36&#34; i think.  these collapse and fit into the larger bag which is where they go when we return..  and it is really easy to get 50 lbs into one of these. they roll well and have lasted a couple trips now filled with mechanical stuff dvd's radios, books and kitchen stuff, no rips tears or problems.  too big not to check but that is perfect for us.
83195	love the shoe but i should have  believed the reviewers who said get a size up. one reviewer said get your regular size and i have been so consistently a size 41n in this brand that i stuck with that and it turns out that you definitely need one size up. because the company fails to supply this information and you have to just wade through all the reviews and then wonder if the advice is just one or two person's opinion or actual fact is a distinct disadvantage when buying birkenstocks and actually any on-line brands. by relying on reviews to inform customers, this company abdicates its responsibility to properly inform the buyers of its shoes. for this reason i have deducted three stars from this purchase which i had go through the hassle of returning for a larger size..
83317	i bought these on a whim, based on the positive reviews i'd read, because i have not worn a heeled shoe in 7-8 years, literally, and because of some foot issues didn't even know if i could wear a heel anymore.  but circumstances change, and i needed some dress shoes, so i decided to give them a try based on my great experience with nb athletic shoes and the overwhelmingly positive reviews i read here.i'm so glad i did!  it was literally an epiphany, to put these on and 1) not be in pain, 2) not really be aware i was wearing anything with a heel, and 3) look down to see something other than absolutely flat tennis shoes or moccasins on my feet.  i literally did not think it was possible.  but there it is. :)
83352	i just got the watch today, had a couple links removed at my local drug store and it is..... awesome! i'm a man but i liked the color and simplicity of this watch. even though it's women's it looks the same as men's watches. it's the perfect size and color for me as i have small wrists but even if i didn't it's nit at all dainty. it's a tiny bit more gold than the photo but not a lot darker necessarily. the packaging was very nice i'm hoping the finish doesn't show wear like other reviewers mentioned. if it does i'll post it here immediately because it's too expensive for that to happen. if there's no re post there is no wear .) classy smooth watch .) i likey!
83371	my princess loves this watch.  i have to remind her to actually take it off at night.  one note:  the band is tan, not red.
83382	****the soles of both shoes have cracked completely through across the toe box and up through to the upper /material part of the shoe body after only 7 months!  i have contacted the seller!****i had a pair of ariats that i had worn for 2 years when i decided to get a new pair of shoes.  these borns look just like the ariats but they don't soften up or break in as nicely.  its been a year and the case of the shoe is hard, which may be a good sign for durability, but i would've liked the shoe to break in more.  the heel is a harder heel than the ariat so it strikes the ground harder.  i have an extremely sensitive neck and back from two accidents 10 yrs ago and really wanted a shoe that could serve as a shock absorber.  unfortunately, this shoe is still too tough and slightly uncomfortable after daily wear to the office.  i agree with other posters, that many of these shoes these days are arriving with one shoe bigger than the other and the quality has gone down. that's not the case with these, but its hard to find a good pair of shoes without compromising on one aspect of comfort.***no, it's november 2013 and i never heard from the seller or manufacturer. they have lost my business, sketchers are actually more comfortable for this winter! ***
83434	i've mentioned in past reviews that i have wide feet. i've always had them. i suspect i always will. these feet take me from place to place but also secure me to wearing ugly, &#34;old lady&#34; shoes. these shoes aren't that type. some fashion savvy people may disagree and i'd see their point. however, if you work outside of the home in a professional office and want to be comfortable in flats that are a female version of a man's shoe, then these are the shoes for you. ok, i just read what i typed. they aren't that ugly.they are comfortable. the finish is kind of dull. the description of them on here is exact. there wasn't any showmanship inserted to give you razzmatazz.if you dress plain mostly or once in awhile or maybe preppy...buy them. i think you'll like what you are gonna get.
83464	so surprised all i ever buy is nike flops these are so uncomfortable and fit horribly. ..wasted alot of money ..not happy w purchase at all!!!
83530	the colors of this scarf are pretty, but it is made of very cheap material. certainly not worth $19.99. there was no material listed in the description, but since it is advertised as a pashmina, i foolishly assumed it was made of nicer material (maybe even pashmina). i would not have ordered this scarf if i had realized my mistake.
83601	the touch of pink looks so nice with the dark brown.  they can be dressed up or down!  if this camein pink and black--i'd be so happy!
83715	i was looking for some inexpensive flip flops since mine broke when i found these. i thought crocs have a good reputation and when i saw that only the size 9 women/7 men yellow crocs were on sale i bought them even though i wear a 9 1/2 to 10 in womens and don't like the color yellow. i am very pleased with them they seemed to run a little big in my opinion and i can comfortably fit my big feet in them! although i am self conscious about wearing flourescent yellow shoes it was a really good deal and they are super comfortable. it's like the color that crossguards wear... flourescent yellow. can't wait to take them to the beach!
83750	crocs don't come in half sizes,and thats where i had problems with them,i ordered the next size up,mens 8 womens 10,and they made my feet hurt,were extremely uncomfortable,they kept sliding around on my feet,a smaller size wouldn't have fit either.i'll never buy any crocs products again.
83850	purchased this guess men's organizer wallet from amazon.com. i purchase many of my online products through amazon.com as i have found them to offer exceptional quality products with a customer service that exceeds all my expectations.i was researching changing wallets from what i am presently using, not out of my current wallet being worn out, but by function, organization of contents, and a new desire to wear my wallet in my front pocket.i am visually impaired and needed something where i can organize my cards & contents in a way, that is easy to pick up with my limited vision. i looked at many brands and styles (including front pocket wallets) and decided on the guess organizer wallet. i really like the layout of the wallet with it's card holders and placement of my i.d.. i also like the slim design and the way i can carry in my front pocket without feeling like i am carrying an anchor. i love the leather and its feel and smell.i believe the quality appears to be top notch with the thickness of the leather and the tightness of the stiching.looking for a well made, well organized manly wallet, this would be a great choice. high recommendations !
83902	this color is so rich and beautiful.  great as a coin purse or key holder or even a rosary case.  i would highly recommend!
83935	i normally wear a size l or xl.  i bought a 2x based on other's recommendations.  does this cinch in the waist?  oh yeah! if that matters to you more than being able to relax, breathe and feel comfortable, then you'll be alright.  but if you want to feel comfortable, forget it.  i had to struggle so much to get this thing on, i actually broke out in a sweat.  it took me 3 different times at attempting to get this completely hooked up before i finally did.  i was amazed at how small my waist looked and how it showed off my curves, but i felt sick from the tightness of it and knew instantly i would never be able to wear this.  i had to truly reassess how desperate i'd have to be to wear this as i knew i'd have to have it on for hours under the evening gown i have to wear.  i decided that at 5' 7&#34; and 165 pounds, i'd celebrate my womanly curves  instead of have to endure wearing a corset to hide them.  it also has a very strong rubbery smell and i question whether it should even be against skin at all.  i'm sure you could layer underneath it and probably should, but to me, it would have just added more warmth and discomfort.  for me, it wasn't worth it at all.  :-(
83942	i have this in the seamless variety, too, and like this best. i got it in large because i wanted the most control while i am also losing weight. i have 2 other vedette shapewear styles and this one is much easier to get into and out of on my own. take your time though, since you'll have a lot of work getting in either... just that you may need an assist with the seamless version. this is cute and does the job quite well! i love having my waist back. :-)
84013	i bought this for my significant other, who often cooks dinner/breakfast and has been driving me crazy getting grease on his clothes. i fits him well (he's approx. 6 feet tall and 195 lbs.). it's long enough to protect his clothing while cooking, and (he says) comfortable. i haven't found any grease on his clothing since he started using it! i haven't tried washing it yet, but it must take stains well, too, because i haven't noticed any yet either. overall, i'm very happy with this apron and would buy it again.
84034	very good quality material and fit.  light enough fabric to not make your head hot, but absorbent enough to trap any sweat from a bald head (i know).
84078	fits good, very light . tongue is padded, very comfortable. roomy toe box.  dressy enough to wear to work daily. need broken in.
84082	i have a difficult time finding winter outdoor gear for my feet, as my feet are very wide. everywhere i have looked i have met with d width disappointment. not these! warning: humor alert! my hunt for winter shoes continuously reminded me of tim curry quotes from the series psych, episode american duos. the first quote: &#34;this car makes me want to weep, and then die,&#34; my search. now as to these dunham 13 eeee shoes, another tim curry quote, &#34;i feel like an angel baby swaddled in a cocoon of cloud candy.&#34;disclaimer: as an added precaution on noticing that the insoles were perfectly shaped to hold a pair of toasty feet inserts, i placed them right inside the insoles, and went out to shovel us out in 7 degree weather. it took me about an hour, and my feet were comfortable, warm, and dry the entire time. never had to break them in first. i have had nothing but success with any new balance shoe. okay, i'll stop gushing now.
84192	what new mom wants to wear a harsh elastic around her rib cage... this was just too tight for me, i am a 36c post-pardum, and m was too small, l was to floppy around the armpits. i wish they had a more stretchy material, so i wouldn't have to feel like i am tied with a rope.i prefer my nursing tank tops with built in bras, since that elastic is much more flexible.as a side note, i am very very picky with my bras as is, i imagine more so now!
84242	you have beautiful well matched and cut gemstones.  i love the light your stones put out, and how expensive the stones look.  i love the fact that i can afford such expensive looking stones.  i tell everyone to check amazon
84266	add ons 3-hook bra extenders are exactly as described - they add from -inch to about 1  inches to any 3-hook bra.  i wear a 48d, and these fit my bras perfectly.  this is great for pregnant women who need a temporary fix as well as those of us who occasionally gain a little weight and would rather not buy new bras!my only complaint would be the colors - i would prefer to be able to buy a pack of three in one color (beige), since i don't wear black or white bras.  but it doesn't really matter what color the extender is, since it's worn underneath clothing.overall, i'm very pleased.
84298	i ordered the purple, and it's a deep, rich color.  the cashmere lining is very soft.  the fit, a 6 1/2, is perfect. i've always had trouble finding this size in the past, and i am pleased that this seller could provide it.  my only concern is that the leather feels very thin, and after using them for only a week and a half, it seems to be stretching out already. so they are not the highest quality leather, and the price is a bit steep.  i have bought beautiful gloves in the past from tjmaxx for $29.95, but you never know what you will find there. so i can't give these a five star rating, but i'm certainly glad to have them.
84309	"i do love these gloves.  they are extremely comfortable as the interior is super soft.  the leather is also extremely soft and pliable.  i own three pair of these; different colors, and it is the color (along with the quality) that drew me to these gloves.  the colors simply ""pop.""while i do not live in a climate that is cold, i do travel to those places quite often.  running around in one of our northern cities in the dead of winter without gloves is a very painful experience, one i will never do again, and if i have to wear these things, i want them to look good, feel good and keep my hands as warm as possible.these do the job.the price here is pretty good compared to what i paid for mine at a retail store."
84368	i bought this on monday.. now it's wednesday. that is the fastest purchase i'd ever rec'd!! i love the bag.. it's bigger than i thought but will be in good use. it feels great with the many compartments inside. the price was also reasonable. this bag is awesome! love the fast service
84404	these are big, which works great for me! the quality seems fab, too. they look expensive and the chocolate color is truly rich.
84511	"these boots are very warm and comfy i wear them around the house and everywhere! the traction problem is minor for me as i went out in the snow came back to our hardwood floor inside and slid a little. i would have given these a five except the inside faux ""shearling"" is a light beige instead of black."
84559	this is a great sandal.  the fit is excellent, the customizability is great.  i had quit buying tevas due to some bad experiences with fit and feel, but i took a chance on these, and they're great.  i can't comment on durability yet (which *has* been a problem for me with past tevas), but so far (3 months), they've held up well. they also look relatively stylish while remaining functional.the thicker sole gives a good combination of support/sturdiness and lightness for a sandal.  i'm comfortable wearing these in all kinds of conditions, and they feel good on my foot.  i can wear them kayaking, get out of the boat and slog around in the lake, and get back in the boat without feeling burdened by the shoe.  i can wear them on the dock and doing light yard work without worrying about traction, but can also wear them on the boat or into the water.they do keep water (a little slow to dry), which means that wearing them wet all day leaves my feet feeling a bit soggy, but i think that's the tradeoff for a comfortable footbed and a sturdy sandal.  i have had sandals that dried quicker, but they felt flimsy and didn't last.if there is a sandal &#34;spectrum&#34;, these fall somewhere in the middle -- they are heavier than ultralight sandals, which means they're sturdier and have a more comfortable footbed, but don't shed water as well. they are, however, lighter and faster draining than those with a toebox and thicker soles.  i find them to be a good compromise among the competing needs of a water sandal - weight, comfort, protection, and flexibility.they fit my needs, so if those match yours, these are a great choice.
84619	other teva models have adjustable top straps.  this does not show up in the product picture or desription.
84645	the johnston & murphy shuler slip-on is an exceedingly comfortable shoe.  the interior is lined quite thoroughly and the sole is padded nicely.  on the downside, the shoe is not too attractive.  it's certainly fine enough to wear out and about for work or business-casual, but probably not with a suit.  the leather used has a very large grain and the stitching is very prominent.  the form is less than modern though not classic either.  overall, i'd recommend this shoe if you can get a good deal on it and you are either looking for something very comfortable or with a large grain leather (for some strange reason).
84767	these shoes are very comfortable. they feel like they hug every angle of my feet. the velcro straps lets you adjust the width in the front and back of shoe. they are not as cute as the teva kayenta, which i also own, but they are definitely more comfortable. great for casual travel, walks.
84815	"about eighteen months ago, i bought a multi-gemstone/diamond bracelet for my wife.  like many men, i suppose, i have a hit or miss record of buying jewelry for my wife that she likes.  so, i was pleasantly surprised when she liked the bracelet, and wore it to work and other places.  i ended up buying her some matching earrings, which she also enjoyed.fast forward to now, and this product, the ""18k yellow gold plated sterling silver multi-gemstone and diamond accent drop pendant"", which i've gotten for her, which basically completes a set.  below are my/her impressions.pros:- it's attractive, and the starburst pattern is unusual in a nice way and eye-catching- it goes well as part of a set or as a stand-alone itemcon:- the included 18-inch chain is ""delicate"" (but attractive) but is possibly too light for the pendant.  the pendant does have a large opening, where a thicker chain can be threaded through if desired.be aware that that the product pictures show the pendant's colors in a well-lit, best possible case.  there isn't anything wrong or sinister about that ... all pieces of jewelry as shown the same way.  but the short video amazon loaded shows the pendant's colors closer to what you can expect to see when it's worn.overall, this is a good looking piece of jewelry that is worth the asking price.  it's a bit different from other pendants, and my wife has received nice comments on it.  four stars."
84835	bought these along with the leggings, and thought i would decide which i wanted to keep, well, i'm keeping them both.look great with longish top, and a pair of sandals or low heeled shoes. heavy enough to pull me in, but light enough for summer.nordstrom use to have a pretty decent legging, but they discontinued them and few years back, and i have not been able to find a comparable pair until now.
84837	met my expectations for a basic legging in this price range, but nothing to write home about.  thigh area pitted after first wear.  the top area is nice as they fit snugly and don't sag like other yoga style pants tend to do. i found them to be fairly true to size.  i'm not sure if i'd order again. i'm not dissatisfied, but i don't truly feel like i can give a glowing recommendation either.
84870	i've been a capezio fan since i was a kid. i still go to classes to stay in shape and love this leotard. it does run smaller than street size, which is typical for many dance products, but it holds everything in and has a nice bra shelf sewn inside. i own 2 of these leotards and plan to buy more.
84884	i have two pairs of these shoes, one in white/black and the other white on white.i love them for several reasons.  first of all, both pairs have held up for years.  there is wear, and i don't wear them every day, but for a five-year-old sneaker, they are practically pristine.  they are great walking-around shoes with plenty of support.  i have fairly weak ankles, but these shoes don't roll even though they are low-tops. they are a bit more narrow than some other brands; i'm supposing that they are designed with the european market more in mind.i hate them for one reason.  the laces that come standard never stay tied.  i haven't replaced them on either of the pairs i own, but every time i wear them they come untied even from double knots.  it is some sort of dark magic i haven't been able to understand, though i've learned to cope with it.
84893	i have purchased lickity  sticks which are very good because they are low calories n made in the usa. this has all of the above plus i make it with good ingredients n no preservatives. take 2 teaspoons of plain yogurt, water, shake it up n u have a inexpensive healthy treat. easy to clean n you can use almost anything healthy with water ie peanut butter, yogurt, etc
84947	i was concerned about the performance of the rotating mechanism and that it would not be tall enough but i was wrong on both counts. it meets my needs perfectly! may even get anothther one!
84949	it looks beautiful, but the top only sits on the little pole and if you don't hang your necklaces in a perfectly even way, one side goes down and the other up and it looks a little odd, unless you do like me and have both sides with the same amount of necklaces thus the piece stays straight. if that doesn't bother you then it is a nice piece to keep your necklaces in order. be sure to read the measurements so you won't get surprised, long necklaces won't work on this one.
85025	i bought a tube of shoe goo to repair my favorite lands end slip ons that were separating in the front. spreading on a generous amount of shoe glue, i used the adhesive to repair and also to seal all around the front seam where the heel meets shoe. the repair is so strong that it may outlast the shoes. incredible stuff.i also used the shoe goo to repair a couple tears in a storm window i made with plastic sheeting. again the repair should outlast the window.my greatest use of shoe goo was to attach a small potato head to the top of our mailbox. at least three previous potato heads on the mailbox have been stolen by vandals. to take this newest ph, they might just have to take the whole mailbox. i hope they don't.the goo is not easy to squeeze out of the tube and it is very sticky and not easy to spread. however, it dries relatively quickly and works fabulously. putting a layer of vaseline on the threads before replacing the lid will insure that the lid won't be locked tight to the tube.i heartily recommend this product for repairs or adhesion. my next project is a torn (soft) toilet seat. it would be wise not to use the seat before the goo is dry.
85028	i think this is supposed to work but it absolutely does not. perhaps i needed a vice to compress the sole of my keens. this just didn't hold up. bye-bye keens.
85040	looks good, i have 4 of the same in different colors to go with my work out outfit,g shock by casio is the best watch to use in athletics of any kind this company had the lowest price in the net,and also good service. for a casio don't need to go no where else.they also include a 20 % discount coupon for next purchase.
85123	i expected these to provide really good cushion but fell short of what i hoped for. i found the thong part a little uncomfortable, but the upper strap was very nice. i returned these and just ended up getting another pair of my old ones because even a size bigger i thought these would still be too snug.
85165	i am very happy with the shape this waistnipper gives me you cannot tell if am wearing it, there are not lines on the outside of your clothes and the finish is smooth and nice, am loving it
85172	this thing is super tight.  i removed the metal boning, because who wants boning?  it creates a funny shape and bends- permanently.  it also made it too difficult to get on.  but maybe if you're smaller to begin with, you can work with the boning.as always with serious torso shapewear, bring it up from your ankles.i kind of wish it were a couple inches longer or came in a long torso version so it would help keep low rise pants up.
85190	"this is the most comfortable bra i've owned so far. i am fairly large (42c) and i needed something to hold ""them"" up, so they don't look like they're down to my waist. :o)this bra does the job. the straps are not the elastic stretchy kind, but they're made of the same material as the bra (the adjustment straps are in the back).the straps do not dig into my shoulders and there's extra support right under the breast for a little ""push"". it has a three hook closure, and the closure material is not itchy (this is my problem with all bras). this bra will keep your ""ladies"" separated and it also gives you a natural look, not the madonna cone style. it's not bulky or too thin, but it is a ""two-ply"" cup, which for me, is perfect. i forget i have this on. i purchased a few more. i love bali!!!"
85289	ok--so i decided to wait on my review of these to be as accurate as possible.  first, not very fashionable but once you've been suffering with the horrible pain of pf for awhile you won't care-- if they work.  when i first put them on they hurt like you wouldn't believe!  i say this to warn people because i wanted to return them at first--but don't be deterred.  i did what the birkenstock website said, to wear them around the house for quite a while.  at first, i noticed that my feet felt fantastic afterwards and figured maybe they were numb from the pain lol.  well i don't know what happened but now they don't necessarily feel bad or painful i just don't really feel anything, but they do feel like you have bricks on your feet but not in a painful way.  i can say, i think the pain has lessened considerably even when i'm not wearing them.  i'm actually kind of upset that my doctor didn't suggest them.  i have done everything except the surgery and i can be honest, these shoes seems to have been the best improvement on the pain level i've seen in my pf.  i can only hope they get even better with more time, i am starting to wear them outside now but not for too long.
85295	i have pf and metatarsal stress syndrome.  i bought these shoes and it took the pain away.  i also like the looks of this sandal.  you do have to break the shoes in and let your feet form to all the arch supports.  i now slip them on the minute i get out of bed.  if you have ever experienced plantar fasciitis, you know of the pain you feel when you step out of bed in the mornings.  these shoes are magical,  no pain, due to the arches built in the footbed.  i love my birkenstocks.
85314	i have a pair of these i got a couple of years ago so purchased these for replacement.  the quality of the workmanship is not as good as my old pair.  the leather is very stiff and wearing them will take some adjustment and breaking in.
85329	the picture doesn't do this product any justice. it is really great looking. the fabric that this is made of is so soft. love the fit and how it looks. very durable as i used it to scuba dive on several dives and just needed to rinse it out and it still looks great.
85382	it came with a hole in the finger.  cheap would be and understatement.  they fit little kid fingers terribly, just look at the picture.  if the amazon picture can't hide the disfigured hand shape, the real mccoy is not much better.
85383	my grandson is almost 4 years old and the gloves are a bit big for him but he doesn't mind.  i like the fact that he has room to grow into them but can still wear them now.  he loves being spider man and these gloves complete his spidey costume.  the delivery time was great too.
85412	i have received many compliments on this ring.  it is also extremely comfortable.  the stones are embedded so no fear of losing them.
85456	this is my second pair of this insole. these are not for you if you're wanting a 'mushy' insole! these give great support and can make your shoes feel  like new again. i've had numerous foot surgeries and they make my feet feel so much better.
85463	these are costly but are the best i have tried to convert a pair of shoes from loser to winner. not recommended for a shoe that already fits snuggly. these are not the trim-to-fit kind. order the right size, and they go right in. i always have good luck with new balance.
85560	"after researching several popular brands of hiking boots, i decided to purchase lowa women's renegade hiking boots. i liked what other reviewers had to say about them.i have been wearing them around town to break them in and i haven't been hiking with them yet. the first day took a little bit of adjusting. the right boot fit a little tight and created a pressure spot that had i been hiking in them, it would have been uncomfortable. upon subsequent wearing, the boots stretched in all the right places, and after ""hiking"" in them all day on my monthly shopping trip in a nearby city, they kept my feet comfortable all day. i have every confidence that they will work well when i go on a real hiking trip in the near future.i like the breathe-ability of these boots. my feet tend to overheat quickly and more times than not i'm kicking my shoes off because they get so uncomfortable in some shoes that i wear. however, after wearing the lowa renegade boots all day, my feet were perfectly comfortable.these come in a variety of colors, but i chose red because that's my favorite color. these are a nice, rich red. my daughter says they remind her of tomatoes and make her hungry when she looks at them! i'm not sure if that's a good thing, but either way i'll be sure to work up a good appetite after being on the hiking trails all day.update: i wore these hiking boots on a recent camping/hiking trip. they kept my feet comfortable both days of hiking. the second day was wet and muddy, but my feet stayed dry."
85618	these were just wonderful on vacation, and not too tight, as my feet swell during the heat of the day.  they worked with everything and looked great.  will be buying in other colors if possible.
85633	the beads were advertised as glass....but they are definitely plastic. that was disappointing. still looks ok but not like expected. a bit cheap ..but wearable with jeans etc.
85717	i just ordered these boots and wore them for the first time today. i love that they keep my feet really warm and cozy! they are actually quite comfortable as well. i  sprayed them with some water-resistance spray to keep the faux suede looking new (i highly recommend anyone else who purchases these do the same, as rain would easily make these boots discolored and dirty)... please note: i live in california. we have great weather most of the time. these boots would not be a good investment for anyone who lives where there is severe rain or snow.
85719	i bought this a while back.  i've been waiting to write a review for when it finally snowed.after a couple of months the inside of the boots have worn a bit thinner, but the lining is still holding up.  it still keeps my feet warm while walking in windy, snowy, and rainy conditions.  the sole is good for walking on ice, providing a small amount of grip.  the outside of the boots have not shown any wear yet, despite being worn in all kinds of weather conditions practically every day. when the boots get wet, it does not seep through to the inside.  cannot feel the cold ground through the soles.very good quality for the price.
85771	these cheeky lace undies are nice, but you may want to go down a size from your normal size if you want them snug (the lace is very stretchy).  i agree with the other reviewer that you need to be okay with showing off most of your lower rear since these are cheekies.
85892	my husband is 6'2&#34; 250 pounds usually he wears xl and size 44 suits, which xl says it is for, the shirt was a little too short and the pants were ok, but very very snug so he decided to wear his own pants with the outfit.  i do like the way this costume matches the coloration of another &#34;california costume&#34; pirate that i got for myself. maybe the sizing would be ok for snall or a different size.  the belt and show covers are a cheap plastic, but you expect that for the price.  my husband didn't like the bandana so we bought a hat that he wore instead.
85945	it is very tiny, but it was a gift, so i hope that the person i bought it for likes it.  came in a cheesy flimsy drawstring bag though. not nice, but..
85952	these shoes are very comfy, squishy and nice to walk on. seem to have a non-removable insole. i think i prefer the all croslite design with the nubs, because then if the shoes get wet or dirty i can just wash them off. not sure how that will work with these insoles. the sizing for crocs however is hard to figure out. i size 10 in sassari and 11 in malindi, cleo and frances mj. i got an 11 in these but they r too big. i am wearing them everyday despite the size because they r very comfortable and not as clown-looking as the regular crocs.
85974	"i discovered that crocs has more styles than the much-despised ""cayman"" style that people think of when they hear crocs.  the patricia sandal is a cute, comfortable shoe that can go almost anywhere.  i loved the pair i got so much at a mall kiosk that i bought it in two other colors.  it runs a bit large--i'm normally an 8-1/2, and a size 8 patricia fits me well--so do keep that in mind."
86017	my daugther loved this shirt. its a little on the thin side but i guess thats okay.  i would buy it again
86032	very comfortable first try. easily adjusted to using them on daily 8km walks. they are light weight and look good. i feel they improve my posture and can definitly feel my legs getting a good workout! i love to wear them every day.
86050	these jeans are by far my favorite jeans. they fit perfectly, are stylish and are so comfortable. they do remind me of boyfriend jeans as well like the other reviews said. one thing they are not is skinny jeans...not even close. a wide straight leg if anything. i was thrilled. id read the reviews prior and dislike skinny's very much so i tought id try them. absolutely perfect. wish they came in other colors.
86073	great shoe, i read a lot of reviews about it and lots of people complained about the shoe being narrow and to get a size larger...do not listen to them! i got an 11.5 and i always fit that size, it was half a size too big, i spoke to another guy who has them and he said the same thing; that he wished he had got half a size smaller. they are great shoes, for trail running, for in the gym, or just walking around. the extra half a size bothered me less hiking because you want a bit or room when stomping downhill (you dont want your toe smashing against the end of the shoe) but in the gym my foot slid around a bit inside the shoe when i was doing some more aggressive turns, pivot and jumps. definitely get half a size smaller than you usually get though, unless you have abnormally wide feet (mine are standard width).
86095	made of 100% cotton. they are comfortable and on the big side for size 2t/3t. they are not shrinking after washing.
86159	my daughter likes these because she got purple and orange one. but they are not as soft as carter's. i'm going to keep them but it wasn't what i was expecting
86252	i bought these earrings because i needed more goldtone jewelry and i am really glad i ordered them!  they are beautiful and well made and they go great with most of my outfits.  thank you again amazon!!!!
86261	i was looking for something in the rose gold color. them color is perfect. the size is nice too. they aren't so big that they are uncomfortable, but they are big enough to make a statement.
86303	"forget pandora.  i purchased three bracelets for my daughters and wife.  to say i am impressed with the quality and service is an understatement.the 6 1/2"" bracelet is for my 9 year old.  when ordering, i have one caution- these bracelets run bigger than advertised.  in the case of the 7 inch we ordered, the bracelet measured from end to end (clasp end to end) at over 7 1/4"".  the 6 1/2"" measures 6 3/4"" end to end.  the clasps are hevy duty by any measure and the bracelet has a very solid feel.  the smart beads solidly keep the charms positioned where you want them and prevent charms from falling off when removing the bracelet.we only order zable charms due to the great quality.  we have become zable snobs in fact.  i am unsure about marketing and all that stuff, but a few months ago when i purchased my wife's bracelet, you rarely heard about zable.  now it seems as if everybody is jumping on tha bandwagon.you will not be sorry buying this bracelet.  also, each bracelet comes in a zable presentation box that my kids love.  whenever they take off their bracelet, they put it back into the box.measuring advice- when you measure for thos bracelet, i strongly recommend you measure the widest part of the hand (below knuckles), with the thumb bent inward.  by doing this, you will be sure the bracelet does not roll off the hand during excercise or play."
86308	this watch is really beautiful. i got it for my fiance as an engagement present; then he can carry it on our wedding day. he loved it!
86315	nice thin chain for a pendant. not expensive, it's good to replace a broken one.not the best but then your not paying much! jr~
86341	singapore chains have a natural twist to them, but this one was ridiculous. the catch was flimsy and difficult to use, and the loop at the end of the chain was too thick to slip onto the clasp without tugging. i was afraid i'd break it if i tried any harder. at least the size was right and it arrived on schedule. i've noticed that every chain i ordered from amazon (#5 was a keeper) was less substantial than the photo showed.
86366	design: i wanted a nice umbrella to be able to use to/from work, and the metro dot design certainly suits that professional look while still remaining cute and feminine.open: the button works well to open the umbrella instantly, and i like that it doesn't shoot out too fast.close: i find it difficult to close. you really have to press the handle all the way in until it clicks, and sometimes i have to put my hand at the top to give it that final push. this usually means my hand gets unnecessarily wet or i'm awkwardly stalling in a lobby holding things up.sturdiness: the umbrella itself feels really sturdy, and i have yet to question it when strong gusts of wind come by. the base/handle, however, seems a little wobbly.i was debating between 3 or 4 stars. given the price, i've gone with 4
86373	i bought this umbrella to replace my previous totes compact umbrella, which finally gave up the ghost after several years of use.  i didn't feel angry when it failed, because i had more than gotten my value from it.  i liked it so much that i ordered a new totes compact umbrella just like the old one.i prefer the compact umbrellas because they are lighter weight and small enough to slip into your purse on a cloudy day, but still open up wide enough to give you good protection when you actually need to use it.once a strong wind blew my umbrella completely inside out.  i flipped it back the correct way, and when i closed it up, it retracted and folded up just fine.  tough product!!  highly recommend totes.
86421	i wanted an umbrella that would open - and close - automatically, and i got what i wanted.  well, almost.  it opens just fine, but it only closes partially, and then you have to flatten out all of the floppy fabric manually on each section to make it go back into place.  then you have to jam it back into its original position.  it doesn't go back into position automatically.  the other thing is that to wrap it up with the velcro fastener, you really need a bit of hand strength, which we don't all have as we get older, or if we have a disability.  overall, good value and good quality.
86441	these  shoes are comfortable for everyday casual use the insides are very padded as some boat shoes aren't they are very well made and i feel it was a great purchase and addition to my wardrobe they look great with capris or jeans i will most likely buy another pair  but in a different color
86475	i ordered this dress by following the sizing chart in a 'large'....i could not even pull it up over my hips!  i like the material but have no idea how it would fit.  it was so very small i am sure it would have fit my granddaughter.  seems as if either the measuring chart is incorrect or they put the incorrect tag inside the dress.  it was no way a large.
86490	"in 40 years of wearing jewelry i have never seen a rope chain kink.this chain arrived twisted and kinked in a small felt bag.  not just one ortwo kinks, but totally twisted to the point that it could not be straightened out. completely unusable.think i'll stick with items sold by ""bling"" and ""amazon curated collection"".  they seem to be the best quality."
86512	yes, they have fragile posts, but are perfect to take with me to vegas while i leave my good stuff at home.
86516	i like these a lot. they look very real and the detail is pretty.  good buy for the price.  they warn you that the post is delicate. i am careful and have had no problems.
86588	nice watch. i bought the one in yellow, but also bought this blue colored one. this way i can mix it up with different outfits. i think these watches are good for everyday wear.
86653	a beautiful combo of satin & lace in a panty.  this low-rise bikini fits in with any wardrobe and i love all the colors--especially the red. a very sexy panty.
86674	teenage son loves these sperrys and had to add them to his collection.  always a great shoe.  wears well and looks good.
86703	i love these shoes. they're really sexy and gorgeous and my husband loved them. i'm not used to walking in shoes this high, but i have to say they're pretty comfortable. i'm a size 6.5 and first i ordered a size 7, going by previous reviews, but had to return them. the size 6 i got to replace them fit me perfectly.
86720	i absolutely love these shoes.  unfortunately, the keys hanging from the back when i wore them.  i think it was a result of my foot on the pedal and my heel on the floor of the car.  it just couldn't withstand the action.  the patent leather also ripped on one of the shoes quite early, so i don't get to wear these.  they are definitely one of my favorite shoes, and it's sad that they are unwearable so soon after purchase.
86776	the look and the idea of this mask are great. one big but is that this mask must have been designed for a fat face, it will not fit close to your skin, as a good mask should.
86782	i am so happy i bought it as it looks beautiful.the only thing i noticed is that the zip on the back is little rough for little baby skin but otherwise its beautiful.
86798	this is a beautiful piece of jewelry!  it has been pickled some to bring more contrast to the design. so glad to receive such a great item on amazon!
86861	these were exactly what i was looking for my grand sons christmas gift and their father was quite happy with them.
86871	this is my favorite brand and purse so far.  i have bought 2 other purses from lucky and this was the first leather and it is beautiful.  i want to take it everywhere.  the leather looks and smells great!  smile!
86874	i have owned this bag in a gorgeous turquoise color for threea couple of years now and every time i load it up i'm sorry after just one day.  the bag is beautiful, well made and has lots of bells and whistles but it is so dang heavy!  even worn cross-body it's an uncomfortable bag to carry for very long.  i got it at a sale price at a big name department store and even at that it was really expensive.  i love lucky brand and have another of their bags that is just perfect, but this one was a mistake.
86893	i love these northstar products. i travel a lot ,and have several different sizes, of these quality gear bags, for hauling around all of my outdoor hunting,fishing, cooking, camping gear.the diamond  ripstop material, is very strong, and holds up to the abuse of weather ,or kicking around in the bed of a pickup truck.the zippers are strong and dependable ,that can be a big issue on inferior products, but northstar has that covered with quality components. for dependability, and strength over the long haul,  i give this product a high recommendation  for durability and quality.i hope this review has been helpful ,and helps you make an informed buying decision. thank you.
86956	loved these jazz shoes, much better for my girls than the lace up ones they had before. perfect fit and very comfortable.
86977	i was tired of having to get my watch battery replaced at a jewelry shop so i purchased this set hoping i could open the back of the watch myself. it worked well and now i can buy my own battery at any story and replace it any time i need to.
86980	these are cheap, but look great on. the frame bends easily, but you can shape it back in to place. they don't look cheap on, and for the price, can't really beat it for a stylish pair of aviators.
87013	i normally wear 10 or 12 but got the l4 to get a good wrap. if you check; this is my 5th dress so it goes without saying.
87095	bought this for my mom, who is 5 ft and weighs about 105 lbs.  it was a little tight around her middle, but, we kept the coat.  other than that, she loves the coat!  it is a very nice looking rain coat and looks well made.
87098	i like this jacket, it's a great length, has a hood, fits nicely - not too baggy and not too snug, is somewhere between olive, brown and grey and matches with all of those...and it's made nicely with adjustable sleeve width and a sturdy feel.  has generous snap-close pockets and both a zipper and buttons to close.
87101	a wonderful waterproof coat at a fantastic price! this coat is well made, has a hidden hood and is lined. i'm delighted with this purchase.
87107	this is very much a topcoat--very thin, so you should definitely layer up in cooler weather. i bought a size medium for that reason, when i usually wear size small. the pockets are a bit odd...if you're used to resting your hands in them when walking (as with slash pockets), it's sort of an awkward experience, since the pockets are in front of your hips rather than beside them, and they're covered by a snap-on flap. aside from those things, this is a very lovely and well-made coat, with flattering lines. it's good in light/moderate rain, though i've not used it in a downpour to assess the seams. i've got a biga$$ head, and i was impressed with the generous hood. i'd recommend it for sure.
87114	i wear these mainly under thin bras, because they really don't stay on my themselves. other than that, they work great. no worries about anything awkward, they work under every single bra. comfortable enough that i forget i have them on.
87122	i got this in the brown and tan color.  it is an elegant way to stay warm for the winter.
87126	this is a very pretty scarf! i ordered the brown/black as a gift and the person loved it! i tried it as well and it was soft and very comfortable. it would look great with either a dressy outfit or a casual outfit. i'm going to order one for me too!
87154	pretty good watch for eighty dollars. this was my first invicta and so far i like it. these are fun, inexpensive watches to collect.
87169	"i bought this watch for my son for his birthday. he is extremely choosy when it comes to watches and is like my father - a watch ""connoisseur"". neither of them bat an eye at paying $1200 for a watch!my son wanted a silver/stainless watch - one that doesn't have all the ""bells and whistles"" and one he could wear every day. &lt;he doesn't feel wearing a $1200 watch every day is smart!> so i went to work and looked at many, many watches. i immediately fell in love with the blue face on this watch. i don't know what it was but after looking at so many, this watch just spoke to me, so i bought it.it got here 2 days after i ordered it. you have to love prime!! i have to say i am impressed with the watch's presentation. it comes in a yellow leather box and the inside is a very, very soft chamois? the watch actually sits on a soft chamois pillow.the watch itself is gorgeous. it is definitely much larger and heavier then i thought it would be, but that is not a deal breaker at all. i love the combination shiny/brushed stainless silver of the band, and i really like that the side pushbuttons are large enough that you won't have a hard time using them, but they don't stick out so far that it makes the watch unattractive.i don't understand what all the complaints about the bezel are about. the watch i received is perfect. there are no issues with something being off. everything on this watch is perfect and aligned as it should be. yes, the instruction ""manual"" is just a photocopied page, but it explains what you need to know. yes, the date is small - but it is a watch, not a calendar, and it isn't so small that you need a magnifying glass to see it.someone commented that the watch feels cheap...really?!?! i feel, imho, this is a very well made watch - strong, sturdy and durable. i can't see it breaking unless you throw it at a brick wall or run it over! it has substantial weight. you can see the time, date, seconds, day of week - all of it- well. if you have a small wrist you will need to remove some of the links for a good fit - again, not a deal breaker.i paid $75 for this watch and if i had/wanted to - i would do it all over again. this is a beautiful watch that keeps time and is classy looking. it is absolutely worth every penny! i would recommend this watch to all who want a beautful, classy watch that does what it says and doesn't break the bank!"
87212	very comfortable, lots of padding. cute zebra (bottom is kind of a weird beige color, hence the 4 stars and not 5). was a little tight in toes at first (but i have a wide foot, and they did stretch out perfectly)
87221	these are cute boots, however,,,,,the right boot was at least one size smaller than the left boot. i could not even get my right foot into the boot and the left one was tight as well.  i think they must run small if my left foot was tight in a size 9.5.
87222	looking for a good work shoes that look good as well, and this just looks like a piece of animal leather wrapped around your leg.  i sent them back.
87226	i've purchased other aerosoles boots and have found them to be incredibly comfortable. these boots, however, did not live up to my expectations. while the sizing was correct, they just did not fit quite right. the heel felt lose, while the toe was cramped. glad i didn't pay full price.
87290	i bought these for my daughter who absolutely loves them. she doesn't drive and does a lot of walking, to and from bus stops etc. on rainy days they keep her feet warm and comfy and dry. she wears them at least once a week now that we are in our rainy season and they are holding up beautifully! they look nice with jeans and she's received many compliments on them! i'll be buying a pair for myself!
87291	i wish i had gotten these years ago. i didn't realize what i was missing. they are a great fit ( i wear a size 8) with or without socks. my yard/garden gets wet and muddy, no problem when you have these sloggers on! i also have 4 dogs--  an accidentual step in the wrong place,well these shoes are like new after a rinse with the hose. i went to the garden center and looked down, had on my sloggers! they are that comfortable! thinking about getting an other pair in a different color/ pattern, i like them that much.
87365	i have a left foot that has swelling issues since high school. getting shoes or boots to easily slip on and keep by feet dry has been an issue for years. these, i can slip into, wear them out side in the wet taller grass; and my feet stay dry. who can ask for more?  don't want to say that i can wear them all day and they're a dream on my feet, as they;re not meant to be worn all day.  the do what they were intended for and that's the part i like the best.
87399	this is the cutest and best rain/garden shoe ever!  i have feet that are difficult to fit so i bought these to &#34;try&#34;.  they are soooooooo comfortable i forget i have them on.  absolutely water tight, but since it is a shoe and not an ankle boot, you have to judge the depth of the puddle carefully.  i bought the ankle boot as well to cover all my puddle needs.
87465	my wife was looking for a watch that was smaller then a regular men's watch, but larger then the regualr women's watches.  after much searching, she found this one.  the chonometer functions are fake however.  the watch itself is of very good quality.
87483	"perfect length (i got a 15"" chain) and it sits right in between my collar bones and i put a diamond i'd recived from my grandmother on it.  it's a great necklace at such a cheap price.  i've worn it for about 4 months straight, showers and all and it's still holding up well."
87505	used these for the honeymoon. good for the price. very simple design, but i love seeing it on the bag!
87538	this is a good box for displaying your watches. i have watches up to 47mm. on display and they do not touch. i have had mine for two years and it has held up well. i use it to display some of my more expensive watches including a tourbillon. i think that, if you try it, you will like it. you will especially like the pillows that hold the watches. if you are looking for a display box, consider this one.
87562	i have a number of larger watches on stainless or gold bracelets and most watch boxes will not accommodate them.  this one does! not only are the individual compartments wide and deep enough but the top has enough height to clear the watches. the lower compartments are slightly smaller but still large enough for a big panerai.  the pillows are real pillows that are soft and compliant unlike some others that are stiff with cardboard sides. the advantage to soft pillows is that they will handle whatever size bracelet or strap you have even if you have smaller wrists.the fit and finish are very nice and befit a nice collection. i've tried a lot of boxes over the years and this is the best one i've found and the price is an excellent value.
87580	the difference between this box and other are the pillows. they are actual pillows that for fit the watch.they are tan, soft and form fit to any size watch, gerat purchase and price
87597	this box is better than expected. it was packaged very nicely and arrived quickly. the box is crafted very well and really looks nice. the box is large enough to hold some 52mm watches and is not jammed in. the pillows that hold the watches are nice and give enough so that i can close the watch bracelets. i would highly recommend this case to everyone.
87638	fits well without chafing. breathes well and wicks great. i have a pretty muscular physique, so my waist is rather small relative to my butt and thighs, but these fit well anyway without being too tight.
87640	i have had this ring for less than a week and already it has started to come apart. there is a seam where the metal has been bent together, it is a hollow ring that is very light weight and not sturdy at all. i was counting on this ring as a daily thumb ring but since it has split horizontally it is starting to pinch my skin. i will have to toss it out, what a waste.
87657	you absolutely will not find a shirt with this fabric, this cut, this level of fit and finish, not to mention the mind-numbing attention to detail, for twice the price. mine have been laundered a dozen times and there has been no fade in the true black. the cut is generous but contoured for full freedom of movement without bagging, and the tail is extra-long so it will not come un-tucked. the stitching is heavy, the buttons and details, extraordinary: pockets inside pockets, tabs for holding a rolled sleeve, button stays that keep the collar from sagging and spreading with the top buttons open; vents at the back of the collar... one could go on, and on, and on. go get one. get two, i did. an absolutely outstanding value for money, but then, blackhawk always is.
87780	the first time i used this product, it's fine. when i used it for the 2nd time, it already bent. poor quality...seemed to be a soft kind of metal....not recommended if you'll be using this multiple times...
87835	"the pants themselves are pretty nice. cut well, put together nicely, and they fit as expected. the ""carbon"" color is actually very nice, goes well with faded metal band t-shirts, but i have one compaint: the cargo pocket. first of all, there is only one, on the right leg. second of all, it's zippered on top, and it's tiny. i wear cargo pants to pocket carry a kahr pm9, and it will not fit into this cargo pocket. there is hardly room in there for a wallet, which is a big letdown. still, the pants are very nice, so i ankle-carry when i wear them and that works out fine."
87879	this robe is super soft and comfortable.  the reviews said it ran small, but i didn't listen because i'm stuck in my ways.  i got a medium.  it's not insanely small.  i kept it, because it fit well enough as long as i made sure i only wore it over pajamas.i'm 5'8&#34; and typically wear a size 8/medium.  the sleeves of this were short, but i expected that b/c my arms are long.  if i stand up perfectly straight and arrange the robe just-so, then it wraps around me perfectly.  the second i move, though, it pulls apart below the waist because there is only the tiniest bit of overlap.  make sure you're wearing pajama bottoms or you will definitely feel a draft!aside from the fit issues, it's super soft, and the hood is amazing.  the stripes are pretty too!
87955	i ordered these to wear with my military uniform however i didn't realize that they were short.  they only come up about six to eight inches where i was looking for for over the calf socks.  the sock itself is well made and i decided to keep them to wear with other foot wear.
87971	"several friends, family, and coworkers have all referred to these shoes as ""elf shoes"" because of the tips of the shoes point to the ceiling. i no longer wear these because they do look silly.if you are set on these shoes, i'd recommend maybe a half size small so your toe can get up in there and help point the tip of these elf shoes back to the ground. a pro is that there actually is a lot of room in the shoe so they aren't uncomfortable....they stayed in my closet, and have now made their way to the local salvation army. i wore them maybe 5 times, i hated the way the looked and certainly wasn't alone."
88038	this is not an extra fancy belt, and does not claim to be. but it is of seemingly good quality, true to size, fairly attractive, and looks exactly as pictured. it is true to size and is a perfectly nice belt if you want to wear one that looks like the one in the photo. no complaints whatsoever.
88124	infinite adjustable , affordable belt , looks good , have not had long enough to comment on wear . ordered one i am 6 1 185 pounds now and it was a tad big in xl . however it fit and would expand through about a 44 inch waist . i now wear size 42 pants and they are a little loose . i can fit in 40's with a stretch inseam . belt was shipped with two day shipping for under $9 . the black looks ok with a suit on sunday . i use the brown with jeans and a brown suit . the white with white shoes in summer . the stretch feature makes this so comfortable as well . these belts are perfect for those who have ibs or allot of gas that causes their waisteline to expand often . allot of stretch but hold your pants up .
88351	i put on weight and i needed a really supportive sports bra. these are amazing. i have them in every color. there's definitely no bounce as promised.
88364	like practically every other reviewer here, i've had a heckuva time finding sports bras that work for a larger chest (36d in my case). i'm really happy with this one. i love it. it definitely holds me in place, it doesn't rub or pinch or any of that other uncomfortable stuff, and it's breathable. i don't feel like sweat gets trapped on my chest, and i'm not worry the material will cause friction and breakouts. i like the adjustable straps and adjustable back close. my favorite part of the design, which sets it apart from other full-figured sports bras, are the padded straps. they are considerably more padded than my other sports bras, and i get zero irritation or fatigue in my shoulders. fantastic feature. the front has a mesh panel which allows for  modesty while working out without making me feel closed in or wrapped to my neck in bra.this is a sports bra, for sure. i wouldn't wear this for any other purpose because it doesn't provide the most flattering shape. it's completely unpadded, so if you're in a cold room...you get the point (but i can hardly count that as a con for this bra since i have yet to find a slightly padded sports bra in any brand). under my workout tops, it does prevent the unibreast, which is a big bonus. when i am working out, i want as little bounce as possible, i want to feel securely strapped in, and i don't want to flash people when i bend over for weights or pushups. this ticks all the boxes, and i plan to order more.
88580	i purchased these as a last minute gift for my son's girlfriend. i already had one gift for her and i wish i had skipped these. the looked kind of average to me and her reaction was less than enthusiastic. i even offered to return them but i could tell she didn't want to offend me so she declined.  i wish i would have returned them before even giving them to here. these look much more impressive online both in size and color than in person.  i would not recommend.
88619	i normally wear a size 8.5 or size 9.  i ordered these in size 9 because i have another pair of skechers shape-ups in size 9 (athletic version).  i was really surprised to discover that these sandals were way too big.  there was at least an extra inch of room in the toe area.  they are comfy and i've found that the sole feels more squishy than the sneaker version.  i like them and will consider ordering a 1/2 size or even a full size smaller.
88635	these pants were just okay because they were very thin for being a hanes product. i thought they would be a little warmer for sleep pants.
88658	these give moderate control. they wash well and are pretty for shaping bloomers! i am happy with my purchase. will buy in more colors.
88687	i bought this as a present for my mother when it was on a deal of the day special.  i'll send it back asap.  it's gawdy-looking, has shape flaws (not really round) and the chain came wrapped in knots.  the pendant is  very, very, very small and the chain is thin.  the pendant looks much better online.  i'm disappointed.
88695	what a high quality, beautifully made leather purse.  it's the perfect size and has two inside pockets for cell phone or keys and a zipper back pocket.  i like the wide shoulder strap, because it stays put but doesn't dig into your shoulder.  i just love the fringe, it's what attracted me to the handbag.  i still want to buy the tall fringe boots to go with it.  i have bought the ankle fringe boots to match and love them, too.  if you want a handbags that will hold up to everyday use, definitely buy this one.
88725	very attractive but run small. order half size larger than normal size and should be ok. not at all comfortable as 8.5 which is my normal size.
88729	i had a breast augmentation a few months ago, and i have yet to get around to buying new 'real' bras in my new size (28g). i've been wearing stretchy sports bras or trying to get away with wearing my old dd bras. i ordered this one on a whim, just praying for it to fit. it's great! i bought a 30g, but the band could be tighter (i'm wearing it brand new on the tightest hook...oh well!) i intend to order a 28g next and see if that works well too.it's comfortable, looks nice, and seems to be good quality. i used to wear wacoal all the time and even threw them in the washing machine (never the dryer!) and they held up amazingly well. i think i'll hand wash this one however. augmented boobs are more round and firm compared to natural breasts, so many bras just don't work. i'm so glad this one does! i'm very pleased.
88796	my hubby's pants are where they should be! comfortable and nice looking suspenders are what we both were looking for!
88871	"i'm a size 4-5 and ordered a ""medium"" in black just to make sure these weren't too tight... they fit perfectly! i would definitely recommend going up a size, as they are very fitted in the lower leg and you don't want them to be too tight in the crotch for sitting. i love this style because it literally looks like the legs have been painted black, they aren't too shiny or wrinkled like others that i've seen and paired with a sexy top and some heels, it's a great look for going out. similarly, they aren't so revealing that you can see your panty lines or so low cut that you can't bend over (they came up to my hips and were very smooth and comfortable). i couldn't ask for a better leatherette legging, these are a great deal and very, very flattering to a woman's figure!"
88876	i bought a pair of these for my wife as a present, and i'm pretty sure i'm enjoying them more than she is.  no i'm not wearing them, lol... but she does, and daaamn does she wear them well!!  it's not cheap or trashy, but it looks sexy on her.  if you're a dude searching for something to buy your girl, i suggest a pair of these!  if you're a girl looking for some leggings, this is it!!  it'll definitely get the guys attention.  thanks amazon!
88877	these leggings were very thin and cheap. they looked like they were made of plastic when you put them on. i thought they stretched well but they had a very weird fit as they were loose in the crotch area which is weird. i read that on other reviews but did not think much of it until i tried these on.
88943	i have owned a pair of these boots, but had forgotten how amazingly comfortable they are for a boot, even without insoles they are nice. after i get some insoles they will be perfect, probably wont take them off for a while...great product.
88978	these bras  are awesome - simple, comfortable.  i used to buy victoria secret bras, which are very expensive.  yes they were pretty and comfortable.  but $40+ for a bra is ridiculous when you can get comfort at this price.  i bought 5 of them and love them.  they hold up when washed and hung to dry.  will continue to buy these.
88983	good for a child, the cups are so close together a grown up cant where it. pointy cups also.good luck if your over 14 or 5 feet tall.
89023	this is exactly what i wanted; organization, good looks, and 3 separate sections.the reason i docked a star is because the straps are a little slick and don't want to stay on my shoulder. it is kind of annoying while out, especially as i have a busy toddler and the very last thing i need to have my hands on is my purse.pros:great looks!3 sections: outer two are snapped, the middle one can be zipped completely shutwell madecons:straps tend to slide, they're just too slick
89148	bought these on advice of my daughter and love them.  i had to return the size that i had purchased and customer service was extremely nice about it.  am extremely happy with the fit and the easy care involved- wear almost every day and they have exceeded my expectations.  great company to deal with and excellent quality products.
89153	these were simple enough to pull on/off, keeping in mind they are compression tights and still require a little effort!  the were effective in reducing swelling, and the open toe design was especially nice in a warm climate.  it meant i could still wear my sandals without it being super obvious i was wearing compression stockings :)  they held up perfectly in the wash as well.
89164	i love it, fits just perfect. i love the elastic band around the top, because it holds to your skin, so you don't have that kind that kind of just falls and you have to keep readjusting it. the only thing i will mention is that it does fit a little snug at the top where the elastic band is, so if you where jeans, or anything that is remotely skin tight, it'll look weird, because your thigh fat will cut through haha, i am not even sure how to word that, but you get what i am saying, but other than that it's a great product.
89186	i have had two seiko 5 watches, and i liked them, especially for their status as a nice budget watch. they are lightweight yet relatively sturdy, and they look pretty good, but not great. they are perfect watches for students or people coming out of school who want an acceptably serious-looking watch for their everyday activities, that they don't have to worry about scuffing up.the biggest downside of the seiko 5 in my experience is accuracy. i had one that was off by a couple of minutes a day. and it was running slow, not fast, so i had to adjust it frequently and was constantly worried about being late. it got to where i'd set it five minutes fast and hope that i remembered to adjust it before it went behind again. i think that watch may have been the exception rather than the rule, as my other seiko 5 was reasonably accurate. i had to adjust it every week or so. i took the inaccurate one in to a jeweler's for adjustment, and he said he could adjust it, but it wouldn't do much good in the long term, it would just get out of sync again.still, seiko 5s were my primary watch for a good few years. it is a reliable basic automatic watch and has decent enough water resistance. a good choice for a budget automatic.
89209	what!?!?!  an automatic, 21 piece, visible back movement, seiko for 50 bucks?!?!?!  bang baby!!!  bought one!!!!  and my dad loved it.  he loved it so much that he ended up with it.....  ahh well...  the old man has done so much for me...  i guess he deserves this and much more.  you should consider buying the one with the green or blue strap also, beautiful and fashionable.  cheers seiko!!  great job all around!
89231	this watch just arrived yesterday as an early fathers day gift from my wife and son. i own another seiko auto watch and asked for this model as a more casual alternative for theme parks and days off. it is spot on with the time i set yesterday. i expect it'll change by a couple seconds here and there overall but seems aok so far. the build quality and materials used in its construction are durable and refined. from previous experience i know the hardlex crystal is near bullet-proof as far as scratch resistance.if i had to pick one thing to improve, i would love to see the hands and markers hold there luminescence longer in the dark. neither this nor the other model i own tend to stay bright for more than 10-15 minutes after sun exposure. it tends not to glow well at all with non-natural light exposure. i don't think it detracts much as i really don't need it at night and i will not knock a star off for it. the winding seems smooth and mostly quiet just as my other.i love this like many other seiko auto watches and wish they had wider distribution in the states.quick update: after over 7 months of use i still love this watch. it is super accurate! you will need to occasionally wash the band with soap and warm water because it will get funky. i don't remove it, i just scrub it on the watch.
89232	the honda civic of automatic watches! love it. i purchased a nicer band but otherwise love it. . . .
89235	after owning the first one and it gaining 30 seconds a day and sending that one back, the second one which amazon shipped out kept great time gaining less than one second a day. however, the biggest downfall of this watch that isn't mentioned much is its power reserve. it wouldn't even stay wound enough to power it from early evening to the next morning. there is no manual wind mechanism on this, it's all from your wrist movement. also, the watch band is very small and if you have even small wrists, it will look like a woman's watchband. i put a nato band on it and that fixed it but it is a small case watch. i would recommend the citizen eco-drive 8180. it is a bit larger and it never needs a battery. also, with its made in japan quartz mov't, it will be the most accurate watch you'll ever own. the seiko 5 is made in malaysia, and evidently you are getting what you pay for, online cult following or not. one last thing to mention re: the seiko, the mov't is the new c mov't, not the b. this is a big deal. back to amazon this one goes too.
89247	kind of baggy cut, but with a jacket on it looks fine.  with a jacket off and a tie on, it looks like michael douglas in &#34;falling down.&#34;  but that's a personal problem, i guess....
89248	a cheaply made shirt at a cheap price.  the color is so stiff it is like leaving the cardboard protector in the shirt.  so thin that you can see all the way through it.  son had to wear a black undershirt with it so his skin did not show through.  fit was true to size but after washing it one time on delicate in cold water most of the black color washed out of it.
89288	too bad they just didn't fit me correctly.  i plan to do a lot of walking on an upcoming trip and the arch support just wasn't in the right place for me, nor were they wide enough.
89312	used this last night for the first time on my yurman silver.  it cleaned it in seconds.  the chains came out super shiny without any work at all.  no problems with the package leaking during shipping.  very pleased with the results.
89318	this cleaner doesnt work at all.  i had to go buy the silver polish that is a paste and use that instead.
89332	these fit perfect and are very durable. i'm happy to finally find a pair of tights i can wear more than once without getting a catch in them.
89372	these boots fit my foot well, the overall basic aesthetic is pleasing, too. however. i couldn't zip them all the way up. from what other reviewers said, that shouldn't have been an issue because they run wide. not for me! there were no measurements on the site stating shaft height or width, either, so it was really misleading.also, the fabric lining was awful. really awful. it was fraying everywhere. i returned them right away.
89378	"i have enough of these (all black) to wear one 5 times a week at the gym for almost two weeks.  this bra has some padding which gives you a nice shape and prevents ""headlights"" from shwoing through.  on a few of them i've had to take scissors and trim the lump on the back of the shoulder straps on the back where it loops through the little ring and is attached back on itself.  so far nothing's unraveled on me and i wash them every time i wear them.  before i trimmed the lumps up i'd just have this annoying burr on my back for several hours and then i'd forget to trim it off when i got home.  this bra is not super stretchy and you might need some help getting out of it the first few times you wear it."
89398	if you are buying a size large because you are wider than 36, large isn't big enough.while the sizing chart claims that the large fits 38-41 chest size this statement is false.even stretched to it's capacity it measures barely 36 so if you truly are 38-41 this will squeeze the heck out of you.love moving comfort but this particular bra is poorly sized.
89426	i had the moving comfort fiona bra and it was the most amazing bra i'd ever worn in my life, so when i needed a new one and all my tanks are racerback, i decided on the juno.  hmm.  on the one hand there is definitely serious control here.  the girls do not move and yet aren't squished.  i don't know how they do it.  i can't imagine what the other reviewers are talking about when they say there are no cups.  there are pretty intense cups and a pretty sexy little sweetheart neckline.  for me, it's a little too va va voom and i miss my fiona which was more straight across the top.  but i don't really want to look like i'm trying to be sexy at the gym.  alas, i'm also getting the underarm cleavage effect.  but maybe that's because i didn't get a size big enough.  i think they do run a bit small for width and a bit big for cups.  i also think it's a bit stiff/scratchy fabric as compared to the fiona.  maybe in time it will loosen up a bit?
89438	i ordered the juno & the maia bra from moving comfort, both in 34dd but the juno didnt fit well as the back was a bit tight & uncomfortable.the cup support in the maia also seems better than the juno, probably due to the underwire in the maia.though you cant notice that there is underwire while wearing it, the maia gives the effect & support of wearing a bra & a sports bra at the same time, but the comfort of wearing just one. the juno has just a foam lining for support....so if you're going for the juno, i'd suggest going a size up in the back (eg 34 to 36) but if you're a dd or more - i'd suggest going for the maia!!
89466	what i liked about this bra: it has back closure, so it's easy to get on and off, the material is really nice, smooth and seamless, and the bra separates your ladies so there's no uniboob.what i disliked:- the material is the thinnest over the bits where you get headlights - the logic here escapes me.- the support is really only medium. you still bounce if you jump or run.- the front velcro straps close towards the inside, i.e. your skin, and you can feel the bumps.- the sizing is totally off. the bra i got was fine in the cups, but the band around the chest was at least two sizes too big, even if you closed it on the shortest hooks possible.given all these factors, i returned the bra and the search continues.
89478	they looked cool in the picture but didnt' like them once i got them and put them on.  made me look like fearless fly or something strange
89483	this robe fits as expected. it is head to tow and extra wrap-around on my chest and waist. i have frozen out 3 neighbors casually chatting outside. they are dressed for heated houses and cars. myself, this is perfect for walking around the house. i save $700 each winter by heating the house to 55 and wearing my robe for 1/10th as much. also these robes last 10-15 years.
89489	due to an ankle injury, i have constant swelling in one ankle, so i tried this and it works great! i can easily put on my tennis shoes now, and i wear it when i exercise. it minimizes the swelling especially after you have been on your feet all day. i am really impressed with this compression sleeve. wish i had found it a long time ago.
89494	this is a really beautiful ring.  it looks really expensive.  the first time i wore it out someone thought it was real diamonds. i would have gave it a five star rating but it was larger than i thought, not really a good everyday ring. but it's ok because it makes a beautiful going out dressy ring.
89539	i purchased one dozen of these toe socks for a birthday party for teenage girls. that's right folks, i paid almost $40--$39.98 for a dozen pieces of junk!  one pair has holes all the way up one side, another pair, well, the stitching is coming out in the toes.  i've only closely checked two pair...wonder what is wrong with the rest of them.  don't bother wasting your money on these riverstone goods toe socks. now what to do to replace these and no time to place an order for something else and get it here on time.  ugh!!!
89578	this product didn't do much when it came to stretching out my shoes but did effectively discolor a pair of brand new shoes. to be on the safe side, i probably shouldn't have used this product on anything other than black leather shoes, not suede or colored shoes and definitely not suede and colored shoes. my bad.
89599	beautiful dress it will work perfect for my sister in-law's wedding the only this is i wish it was a little longer it stops a few inches above my knees i am glad i took the advice that was left by the previous buyers i usually wear a large to x-large i ended up buying a 3x-large fits perfectly defiantly runs in junior size read the size chart and choose what size you need from that
89605	i am a 5 foot 2, mother of three (3yr, 2 yr, 4 month), who lives in brooklyn and almost exclusively uses public transportation. its a .6 mile walk to nearest train and an hour into the city. i needed a bag that would allow me to easily get to any item i needed within seconds. this does that. when i first got it, i packed it as big as i could. it held everything i need in a given day plus some with extra room. it was also heavy. then i downed it to a reasonable amount, change of clothes for each child, 3 changes for infant. 13 infant diapers, 2 pull up diapers and a swim diaper. wipes blankets poertable potty with bags, two 16oz bottles of water, snacks and meals for the day, so on.i then put it on and had an uhohh moment. i hated how it felt. all the weight pushed the bag hard against my lower back while pulling on my shoulders, so the top of the bag didnt even touch my shoulders. it was very uncomfortable. another thing, the container for wipes was hard to put wipes in and the zipper was... interesting. hmm. i was a little uncertain if i was going to like this bag.i strapped baby into my ergo, then reattached bag to my back. then we did our weekly 6 hour round trip into manhattan. i bearly noticed the bag. the way its designed counterweighted the baby on the front so well that it wasnt an issue at all. after 6 hours of running around a huge city with 3 babies, one attached to me with 50lb of extra weight on and lots of stairs to go up and down.... i came home with no sore shoulders. this is awesome.now i would still like it if they had redesigned the wipe container so it was easier to load, but it turned out to be usable. the wipes came out one at a time and with ease.the reason i give this 4 instead of 5 is because the top of the bag doesnt touch by back which means the bag folds over a little and i see this as something that is going to do damage to the bag with consistant use.it woulx be nice if it had a belt and an optional strap over chest.in the end i really really like my bag. i see it as a must have for city dwelling families with multiple children who make long dyy trips by train. i dont think it would be my primary bag if we used a car.
89617	i bought a small and it fits great. currently all my other regular tanks with built in bra, the built in bra part doesn't cover completely anymore. this one fits great, if i wear a bra with it, it completely covers the bra so it doesn't show anywhere. very long and not tight at all in the stomach area. i am six months pregnant and there is still room to grow in this tank. very comfortable.the only tiny thing is the armpit area was a little higher than i was use to, but once i started to wear it more it didn't bother me anymore and i got use to it.
89677	i usually buy hanes for my boys and thought this looked similar but the fabric is not the same.  the boys complain that these are itchy and the material does feel scratchy to me despite several washings to try to soften.  they are also on the long side.  i wish i could return them but too late for that.  i won't be buying this brand again.
89707	i wear it all the time!!, its very comfortable and looks great! it fits as expected came very early! great items!
89712	so cute!! i can dress it up or down, depending on my mood or the day. very comfortable and sexy!
89719	going by their chart, i ordered a 3x, and it does fit but it is long. the empire waist doesn't  fit as low under the bust as it should. it actually comes up about an inch too high, so it doesn't sit directly under. other than the waist, i like this shirt and i am content with my purchase
89720	i love the look at feel of this hoodie. it fit me perfectly. the front was a little low-cut, so i put on a tank top underneath. now after a hard day's sweat, things got a little funny. the dye sort of rubbed off on my tank top. when i took off the hoodie, i had gray rub marks on the underarms and the sides. hopefully they will wash out. other than that, this is a great simple addition to any plus-size gal's closet.
89792	these earrings are beautiful and well made. i really love the clutchless back - very comfortable.  i wear these with jeans and with dressier outfits.
89813	these are nice pants they are soft and not see through like others i have bought. i love all the pockets but they do run a little big. i wear a size 5 in regular pants and i ordered a small and they are till kind of big. i will keep them but next time will order xs. but other than that the length is perfect i am about 5 feet tall.
89826	i have these merino wool leggings that i use as is or under other pants when temps dip and i'm going to be out walking, etc for any length of time.  they are warm, fit well, are soft enough and so cozy to sleep in as well. i followed instructions on washing and drying and am very pleased with the results.  a bit on the expensive side, but i could not find anything cheaper that offered the warmth of these.  i have really lived in them over the winter, so i feel they did turn out to be a good deal!
89842	i do not like, is a synthetic material nothing comfortable, i personally do not like it, do not buy them again, they were very cheap.
89856	i wore these to work on a 7.5hr shift and they were great. did not need to switch to a 2nd pair of shoes have way through the day. however they are not young cute shoes, long skirts and pants only... (smile)
89897	this is an absolutely fabulous front closing bra at a reasonable price. it's got a high back support with straps that are enormously comfortable, and so is the fit under the arms and around the back. i have been damaging my shoulder rotator cuffs trying to hook up my other bra, daily, and will now just order more of these so i never have to reach around behind me ever again. light and well fitting, nicely made, easy to put on. i just loved it from the first time i snapped it together at the front.
89966	the order came fine. shoes look beautiful.one problem, there is a bump inside the shoe, most pronounced in the right one. it hurts the pinky finger of the foot.a definite no go.the left foot feels quite comfortable at the beginning, but later since i started to investigate why mypinky finger is so uncomfortable, the left foot kind of started to feel the bump too.as you can see on the picture, there are three seams coming together on the side of the shoe. that's where the problem is.returning them right away. they are defective, but i'm thinking is it by design?
89967	this product is not so easy to find in local footwear stores. i like this model and was happy to get a good price online. recommended.
89990	i purchased these shoes from, amazon.com for my husband, who has a huge size foot, and i have a difficult time finding shoes that fit his 12 4e feet. however, these fit him perfectly, and he said they are very comfortable to wear. he loved them, and i am one happy customer. these shoes are so nice and attractive and so very clean looking. they are worth every cent. i highly recommend them.
90066	i ordered two of these scarves, one in red and one in purple multi.  they were both very cheap in quality and could really only be worn as pictured in the photo.  the purple one had a long striped flaw through the whole scarf where a portion of the thread it was knit with was much thinner than the rest of the thread.  it was obvious.  i requested and received a prompt return for both items and the shipping of the damaged item.  the customer service was very good.  unfortunately, the return shipping cost via ups was almost as much as the scarves, so maybe i should have just donated them.

90148	the shape of this full-figure bra was not as i had expected. have returned it due to the lack of support.
90158	if you are looking for a fun party--new years--type dress to wear once or twice, this is perfect. it does look a bit cheap, but it got a lot of compliments. it's very obvious that the  top and bottom are separates, sewn together in a cursory manner, but it still did the trick and is a great price point.
90170	"there are 2 main products in the ""bra stash"" category, the braza and the eagle creek.the braza secret pocket is a simple pocket made of nylon lace, nylon mesh and something that resembles bra-lining in between the two layers. there is no spandex in this nylon fabric so it is a rough type of underwear lace. the total size of the pocket is w 2 3/4"" x h 4 3/8"". the opening/closure of this pocket is styled like a pillowcase opening where a piece of fabric on the end gets flipped over to secure the contents. to attach the pocket to the bra strap/panty there is an additional 1""-wide elastic strip that is velcro-ed to the top of flap when it is flipped over closed. the clearance for this strap is 2 3/4"" and so bra straps and panties need to be narrower than that to fit. the braza secret pcoket is also sized to fit a few credit cards and a few bills. when the pocket is flipped inside-out, the interior seams are simply serged.the eagle creek security bra stash is also a simple silk pocket but with a flap and metal snap button closure. it measures roughly w 2 3/4"" x h 4"" and is sized to fit a few credits cards and a few bills. the clearance between the snap closure an the top of the flap is 2"", so any bra or panty strap should be 2"" or narrower to fit. when flipped inside-out, the pocket is completely finished on the inside with invisible seams and 2 small care labels.braza vs eagle creek:* if you have sensitive skin or are active, the eagle creek might be more comfortable as the silk is much softer against the skin and will absorb some sweat. braza's nylon lace might be itchy and rub against the skin.* if your panty or bra strap has a wider band, the braza has 3/4"" more clearance than the eagle creek* if you'd like to keep your secret backup money secret, the braza does not contain any metal parts to set a metal detector off, while the eagle creek has a metal snap button.* will it fall off & things fall out? velcro is always more secure than a mere snap button. plus on the eagle creek, a single snap button serves both as the closure for the pocket and as the fastener to keep the pocket attached to the bra/panty. with a lot of movement and smaller items such as keys can work their way out of the eagle creek much easier than the braza.* ease of use: the eagle creek is easier to use because one snap button both opens the pocket as well as removes it from the bra/panty. the braza one is a two-step system, where the velcro has to be removed, then the closure flipped open.* braza's pocket is made out of underwear material and as such, looks like underwear (in all three color combos), whereas eagle creek's plain silk material doesn't make it as obvious.other issues are:* while the braza's velco is secure, the velcro can and does snag on the delicate fabrics of clothing and underthings.* the eagle creek snap button might loosen over time making the likelihood of it falling off (and/or contents falling out) quite high.* braza's packaging in a plastic sleeve along with cheesy graphics on how to wear the secret pocket seems much more hygienic and user friendly. eagle creek's packaging of just a cardboard hanger, while environmentally friendly, just doesn't seem hygienic.* eagle creek's bra stash is available in only two colours: black and nude while braza's secret pocket is available in nude on nude, black on purple and black on red.conclusion:i have both pockets and use both of them as much as the other. what it comes down to is whether i feel that the nylon will irritate my skin that day (hot & humid day, dancing etc) and if i'll need to access the pocket a lot. if i don't need to access the contents of the pocket that much, then i'll go with the braza. the eagle creek is much more comfortable, but i can't help feeling that is it is not as secure as the braza when worn in certain ways.the perfect bra stash secret pocket would be a combination of eagle creek's silk and workmanship plus braza's secure and redundant design."
90181	i really like the idea of this but the fabric was a little too thick and bulky for it to feel comfortable under clothing. i ended up just splitting my cash in my bag back at the hotel, some in my wallet in my backpack and some in my pants pocket
90201	i love little me. their clothes are subtle and adorable. this is one of the cutest little me footies available in my opnion. super cute frog applique/embroidery on the bodice...not just one but two. and cute frog detail on the feet. the cotton is high quality. thick, smooth to the touch, and washes/dries very well. the colors are girly and whimsical. not too bright or in-your-face.i just love the look and feel of this footie. my girl looks amazing in it as well.as far as fit goes, little me's fit is similar if not just a tiny bit smaller than carters. my girl is quite average in size. about 50-60 percentile for her weight and 60-70 percentile for her height. she is 6 months and fits the 9m (for 6-9 months) almost perfectly. with a little room to grow but not much. i would say that she can probably wear this footie until she is about 7 or 8 months and will likely outgrow it before she is 9 months old.so this runs a little small but that is pretty consistent with all baby clothes of varying materials: cotton, cotton/poly, velour, velboa/fleece, etc. as with all 100% cotton baby clothes, expect shrinkage. i bought a velour little me footie in size 9. when this and the velour footie arrive, they appeared to be the same size. after i washe both, this one became much smaller. fitting my 6 month old baby. the velour one did not shrink at all. it is still too big for my 6 month old girl.overall, this runs small but all 100% cotton baby clothes run small after washing. so i would definitely recommend you check the size/weight of your baby and then get this. it's way too cute to pass up!!!
90202	adorable pink frog sleeper, however i am giving it a four out of five stars because the material of this sleeper is different than than most of the other little me sleepers i've seen and/or own.  other little me sleepers i have button down one leg and are super soft, high quality material.  this sleeper, although 100% cotton, isn't as thick/soft.  it is still nice--however i'd compare it to a carter's child of mine sleeper.  actually, i'm not an expert on baby clothes, but i wouldn't be surprised if this sleeper was made for carters and then sold to little me.  i say this because of how the snaps are designed (down both legs.)  i've not washed the item yet, but i'd say it's worth the $12 i paid for it.  if you are looking for one of the higher quality little me sleepers, go with the bear design (in pink or blue) or the giraffe design, that is gender neutral.  they are a few dollars more here on amazon, but totally worth it in my opinion.
90236	i think what i was hoping for was to get a pair that looked similar to kate middleton's wedges that she often wears. however, they are a little above my age and i am almost 30. i don't think they did much for me. also i should add they are a little tight on the toes so make sure if you are in between sizes, get the size bigger. i normally can wear shoes between 9- 9 1/2 i ordered the 9 1/2. it still fit me slightly tight but i think it's a way better fit than going 9 or a 10.  anyway like i said it wasn't my style afterall so i wound up returning them. i will say that overall they are very comfy and a good shoe from day to night.
90244	i noticed the price of this pair went down to $29.99. totally a perfect deal and i paid over $50 for them a while ago.the inner liner is memory foam and supports my feet well though the heel is fairly high. i walked in them for about the whole evening at a conference and didn't feel the pressure on arch of my feet as usual. nice color with cute heel print pattern design!
90288	these  are  cheap  but  very  good  glasses  ,  everything  looks  crisp and  bright !  i  recomment these  if  you  don't  want  to  spend  alot  on  sunglasses !
90312	i love these earrings . . .  i've worn them for days at a time . . . morning and evening . . .  and wouldn't call them bendable by any means . . . i love them and don't think anyone would ever guess the reasonable price  . . ,  definitely a find!!!
90313	i'm disappointed. the image led me to expect earrings that were slightly more substantial and more full of personality.  these are simple wire earrings.  thin.  frail.  overly delicate.  you can see the souldering points on each of the circles.  the gauge of the wire is extremely thin (much thinner than photo appears). the wire of the hook is possibly more substantial.if you pay 10$ or less than 10$ they are possibly worth it (if you are gentle on earring and therefore wont destroy these easily).  however, i do not think they are worth the 19$ that i paid.
90334	the first i saw it. i was attracted by its wonderful style. however, it is not as big as i imagine.
90446	great product. i bought for my wedding dress but it obviously wouldn't fit because it is designed for coats or short dresses, but i was still pleased with the material.
90488	this bag is just the right size (xsmall). it's well made and worth the price when on sale. it isn't feminine looking at all and is comfortable to wear on long days. this bag will also easily carry an ipad in a protective cover.my only issues are the lack of a handle and the strap being too short for me. i resolved that problem by taking the strap loop out of the quick release buckle and inserting the strap without the loop. i also took the shoulder pad off the strap as i found it bulky.even with these issues this is the best everyday carry bag that i have used.
90493	"i've been a daypack carrier for years. rain or shine, around town or travelling, my backpack was almost always with me. until now. like most people, i couldn't help but notice that messenger bags seem to be taking over the world...so i decided to take the plunge and picked up a small classic messenger recently.things i like*timbuk2 seems to have very good workmanship. plus the lifetime guarantee matches what most major backpack makers offer.*the bag really stays put on my back. unlike a lot of shoulder bags, once the messenger bag is strapped on and hitched up, it hardly moves around at all and is very stable.*on crowded public transit, a messenger bag doesn't mow people down like a backpack.*there's a key fob and lots of pockets.*it's possible to access the interior of the bag without taking it off.things i don't like*when the cam buckle is latched in the ""bag up"" position, there's a big loop of strap hanging loose. it's easy to get caught on things if you're not careful.*one shoulder takes all the weight. when the bag is really loaded down, it gets uncomfortable.*for some reason, the bag looks bigger than it carries. when i first got the bag, the inside seemed gigantic and i didn't think i would ever fill it up. in practice, however, the interior is rather narrow and is really not as cavernous as i thought it was.bottom line: none of the things i don't like about the bag are showstoppers. all in all, the timbuk2 classic messenger is a well-made and functional bag. now, when i don't have a lot of stuff to carry or i don't want to be weighed down by a full-blown daypack, i use my messenger bag. four stars.------addendummany reviews here mention how noisy the velcro is. timbuk2 offers silencer velcro strips on its website in the accessories section. i use them whenever i bring my bag to a place where velcro ripping noises would be disruptive. also, when you get a new bag, you have to look in one of the interior pockets to find the removable cross strap (except with xs bags which don't include it).addendum 2 (april 2014)timbuk2 really does take its lifetime warranty seriously. i recently sent them a bag with fabric and stitching that was beginning to tear. they are repairing my bag and returning it to me at no charge, even though i've been using the bag for over a year. nice!"
90531	i am 6'4&#34; 205 lbs with 36&#34; inseam.- large fits perfectly and proving me the compression i need for during and post workouts. i will order more of this product.
90577	usually wear 5.5 or 6 they offered a 7, its a tad big but doablekinda beefy (would think it was a mans ring if it wasn't for the engraving)seems well made, very study.
90619	this jacket was true to color but not to size. i read the reviews and most of them say to order a size up. it is longer than it is wide. so, if you're a size small, you'd have to order a medium if you want to use a sweater inside, but it will be too long, it is so confusing. i returned mine the next day after i got it.
90634	i have this in pink and wanted aqua, received and was not disappointed. the colors are so vivid. i appreciate reflective quality as i walk at night and this really helps. highly recommend....
90640	this jacket is nice is style and light weight.  i have not worn it yet; only tried it on for size and style.  when i saw it on line, i wanted it in my closet.  i am very happy with the fabric, color, and wear.
90657	this rain jacket is light weight and really keeps you dry. it's nice material that can be wiped off if you spill anything on it.
90671	this jacket was for someone who wears a size 18 and it at least four or five inches from being able to close. for the price i would expect an item to be sized correctly or at least make a notation in the description that the jacket runs very small.  i've read many other reviews (after receiving the jacket) that state the sizing is small.  i hope the seller reads comments and either corrects the sizing or adds comments in the description.
90675	"this is so darned cute - much more so than i expected when i ordered it. also the fit is perfect - i was not sure about that, either.  i am 5'6"" and 150 (or so) lbs and almost ordered a large, but got medium - it fits great. the sleeves are long enough, and they have velcro tabs to snug them at the wrist. the construction seems really good, and the reflective stripe is really reflective. now i can walk the dog in the rain at night and not worry about not being seen."
90715	"the image portrays this pendant as a flat, matte stainless steel. i didn't think that i wanted it. i opened up the video.  so glad i did.  it is polished, it glistens and it beautifulit is about an inch and a quarter long and about an eighth on an inch thich. stainless is very durable, it will not bend or tarnish.that cz is tension set, and i don't think it's gonna go anywhere.  the cz is at least the equivalent of a one carat diamond, very clean and sparkly.it came with an 18"" ball bead chain. i found a 16"" 2.4mm stainless steel rope chain (from amazon).  the total dimension of this pendants needs a larger chain than what it arrives with, (in my opinion).even though this is a rather large pendant, it is not that heavy. i have worn it a few times and get many compliments when i do.this is my version of an eternity pendant that i simply cannot afford!"
90735	i was a bit hesitant because the description stated synthetic leather which is generally no much better than plastic. this bag is so soft and leather like i wouldn't know its not leather if i hadn't read that. it is a bit larger than i had anticipated but that is not a problem. i looks great and carries very nicely, and the price is great!. i would definitely recommend this to everyone!
90741	i love this bag!!  i am getting a lot of compliments on it.  the bag looks expensive but really isn't!!  i think i need a brown one!!!
90749	i love this bag! it's a nice soft bag with just enough everything-plenty of room,compartments and best of all to me it carries just right on my shoulder..alot of bags have too short of straps and the bag is often at a weird awkward uncomfortable place on my side but this one is perfect..just enough length where it isn't clutched in the armpit or too low to the waist.i got it in green but intend to buy other colors too.i have used this on trips and daily life...perfect for carrying your usual essentials plus enough room for ipad.
90754	these are very comfortable, if a bit heavy. they work as expected, how ever the quality is not that great. the stitching at the cuff hast all but come undone so now half the cuff hangs open. i guess i can get these fixed since the product it self is still in pretty good condition. i have had them for about 2 months.
90764	"i purchased a couple pairs for knocking around the house and also as an added layer under sweatpants for walks in colder weather.  i gave them a ""one star"" because the waistband was itching/irritating on my skin.  but unlike cheaper brands, at least they stay up.  as far as the cut, they are a little on the roomy side.  if you are on the border line between sizes, i would advise going down one."
90822	i've bought several of these assortments and i'm always happy with the assortment (never received a duplicate, even when buying several sets at once) and range of colors and patterns. quality's not excellent, though- the top balls do split eventually, especially if you try to screw them in too tight, but even if not many of them have cracked or split while i was wearing them after a couple months of wear, which is reasonable for what i paid for them.
90836	i ordered large because i would rather pajamas be too big than too small. these were huge so i returned them to exchange them for a medium. i had no problems there, they immediately sent me the exchange. the only problem was the medium was huge too. they're comfortable so i'm not going to return them. just know that if your a medium you might want to order a small. they are cute though. and very soft.
90881	these are just what i was looking for to travel with; they're so well designed!  the bottles are a nice size and have dials at the bottom to show what is inside the tube.  filling is a snap and they didn't leak at all in my bag.  a+ and worth the price!
90917	the shoe is comfortable but there are some seam issues where the rubber and the material come together.  before i put them on the first time i could see where the material is pulling away from the rubber and the material is now stretched very thin there .  i can tell that they will eventually rip.  i dont think i would buy these again;
90968	not sure why others say these are see through because they are leggings and are great. maybe they need a larger size - i'm 5'8&#34; w long legs and the mediums fit perfectly. very pleased.
91031	this is the only nautilus shoe i've ever tried so take my fitment complaints with a grain of salt. i originally ordered size 11 2e and they were way too tight. exchanged them for size 11.5 and they are too loose on the top half of the shoe. i needed some safety toe shoes for work asap and i didn't have time to screw around with another style or brand. i've never had a fitment issue like this with any other brand of shoe though.the quality of these shoes are below par as well. i've been wearing them for less than 2 months in a warehouse and the threads are coming out of the seams. the laces that came with them were also aggravating. they seemed to be super smooth and wouldn't grip themselves so they were hard to get tight while tying them.i do have to say the soles are very grippy on smooth concrete and the tread has held up very well so far.i don't think i will buy nautilus in the future.
91059	these sandals are so soft and comfortable, i love them! no breaking in required! i loved the cream color also, the light color makes your legs look longer!
91084	i have had hanes tanks in the past. they are super comfortable. tanks generally run  little tighter when made of cotton so i buy a large. they are tagless and wash super easy. the pack i got was but 4, get 1 free. its great as a shirt to keep you warm under other clothes or to cover you up when you need to take other clothes off in the summer. they don't rip easy and are pretty durable. i've had the same ones in the past that i wear for years and no holes or signs of wear.
91107	lots of colors to choose from, but they are not full size pocket squares. due to them being smaller its hard to get some of the nicer folds with these.
91178	it is just plain wasteful to use disposable tissues when these things are so easy to use and wash.  i carry two of these around in my purse and leave the other four at home, with one by my bed, a couple in the bathroom and one in my underwear drawer.  i always have one handy and they are soft, large enough, and of course, highly washable.  i was worried i might have trouble with them staining but they've come out perfectly clean every time.  they don't seem cheap or too thin, although the edges on some of mine don't lay flat.  i guess you're supposed to iron them.  i love the beautiful designs on these.
91248	these shoes fit great and look great.  the red is a little more tomato-ey (orange/yellow aspect) than i would've liked, but i'm thrilled otherwise.
91334	these shoes look so nice on.  they are a nice casual shoe, or could be worn with skirts or dresses if you'd like.  they were comfortable, but the first wear was a break in time for the back of the shoes.  the leather is so soft it will form to fit quickly.
91337	i love this as a scarf. it's warm, soft and doesn't get itchy like wool. it's length and width also gives it a lot of versatility with styles. i'll be ordering many more in several colors.
91352	i got what i thought i would get for 9 dollars. something simple and adequate. if you want a spectacular pashmina, spend $50.
91449	"the set i received was a set of pink/purple/flower designs instead of as pictured. they're cute, albeit juvenile, and are incredible comfortable, but i was looking for the ""normal"" colors as pictured and described."
91456	ok, they're underpants.  but they're very soft, smooth, don't make panty lines (if you buy the right size!) and they're really comfy!
91464	these are very very cute and i love the fabric, 95% cotton and 5% lycra. but they ride up because in addition to lacking elastic around the legholes, there isn't enough fabric in the rump area. and i have a very small butt and don't need much fabric. but i walk a lot and they keep making (what another reviewer called) a wedgie in the rear which to me is a really obnoxious feeling. and i certainly don't like that temptation to keep putting my hand back there to get the wedged material out of my - you know. so these are a real annoyance factor. please be warned. back they go to where i bought them.comment comment | permalink
91560	i wear 30 x 30 but i believe that i need to go a little longer on the length as it tends to be a little too snug on my nuts. but other that that the colour is excellent and the material is great.
91563	these are great quality pants but the legs are not at all slim.  they are straight but much wider than the picture depicts.
91567	finally tights that fit! hard to find when you are plus size. i ordered a size bigger than i normally would to be sure!  color (purple) is really nice. very comfortable
91596	i have read so many descriptions of fabric bamboo products recently i was anxious to try out this new age material for myself. alas, i was disappointed when these arrived. they are heavier than i expected, a little thicker than i imagined they would feel. i didn't care for the way they felt between the sheets either, making me feel like a piece of felt stuck on a felt board, sticking to the covers unpleasantly. maybe they won't affect you in the same way, after all, i don't eat peaches with the skin on because their skin feels unpleasant to the touch to me. and don't even get me started on corduroy . . . .
91617	"this is amazing fabric!  not only is it light and soft against my skin, it is stretchy.  and even though it's stretchy it doesn't lose it's shape.  the color is a peach that tends more towards the orange side but not overly so, it has a very soft tone.i ordered it in large but probably could have gotten a medium.  normally, i wear a size 12, and am 5'4"".  i had actually ordered it for a gift, but liked it so much i kept it for myself, does that make me a bad person??  (i hope not)"
91626	overall, i really like these. the sock adds a layer of comfort. the tights aren't as nice as i'd like; they're very thin and somewhat sheer.
91654	i use this for plane travel.  it is perfectly organized and carries all of the essentials on board.  i only travel with a rolling carry on suitcase and this bag.  have stayed up to three weeks with just those two items and had all that i needed and then some.  would be too large for me for everyday use.  i carry the baggallini sicily bag in my suitcase and use it when i arrive at my destination.  best tote i have every used.
91682	may 2012 - i purchased this luggage set in feb of 2011 and already need to buy a new set. the handles on the largest and smallest roller bags no longer extend (i find this to be a deal breaker, as i cannot carry a packed bag through the airport). the plastic by the wheels on all 3 bags is breaking off. i do travel regularly for business, but do not typically use more than 1 bag per trip. i would estimate that i have used each bag no more than 5 times over the last year. i was very disappointed that the bags did not hold up better.positive note: the color was eye catching.
91693	i'm a little late with my review. i actually ordered these last year for our trip to germany. we took only the two largest pieces and the carry on with us. our first flight was late so we missed our connection and had to be booked onto a different flight. we finally got to our destination but our luggage did not. apparently, it took the trip without us on a couple of different planes. when some friendly airport staff delivered our luggage the next day, it did look a bit beat up, but was still perfectly functional without any tears. after the first trip, all pieces look like we can still use them for several trips in the future. overall i think it's good value for the money.
91707	nice set, good customer service, nice quality and fast delivery.. i  like it and i recommend this great set..my comments has been rejected several times and i dont know why, if this is not posted. i'm done reviewing this..thanks.
91783	i have cake and hot milk nursing bras, and this is no comparison.  the qt is a very basic nursing bra with no frills.  however, it fits well, is constructed well, and is comfortable.  it is seamless so you don't have any issues with it showing through a tshirt.  it is made of cotton so it is soft.  i bought  these bras as a transition between &#34;just before i have the  baby&#34; and &#34;a few months after delivery&#34; when i don't fit into my sexier mama bras.
91797	it just came in the mail today & i love it. but i hope the little stones don't fall out so we will see.
91834	my  8year daughter love it and wear it every day and everywhere  it's nice pink watch great deal for its price
91845	not great - very thin, does not provide much warmth at all and is very cheap feeling.  you get what you paid for, i guess.
91883	the ankle length leggings are great pair to have around you home. whether you are wearing them for a workout, or just wearing around your home, these leggings are managed as they are as comfortable as a pair of lysse leggings for women - tight ankle legging. unless you are looking for something longer, these leggings should definitely be fitting for your daily life.
92003	"okay so it's just a cheap toy crown thing...and it wasn't expensive or anything, fits great...but it arrived with a bunch of the ""jewels"" missing...soo that was kinda lame. but other than that it was awesome!"
92042	i like these organizers a lot. while they take up extra space in your bag, they do help you find all the bits and pieces you bring with you.  i used this size to keep all my chargers, headphones, etc together.  i had a pouch from eagle creek that i used for years, and it is just starting to show wear, so i hope this lasts as long!
92075	i ordered this packing cube as a test, along with a competitor's travel cube.  i found packing cubes to be a very good addition to my travel kit.  it allows you to organize your suitcase by type of clothing, and then be able to find them in the suitcase without jumbling everything up.  it also helps keep clothes from wrinkling as much.  it is very useful and i highly recommend packing cubes for travel organization.the eagle creek packing cubes are top quality.  comparing it to the other brand, it is superior.  it has a handle and the other does not.  it also just looks and feels better.  however it is more expensive, and the other brand provides good service and utilization as well.i recommend the product due to the utility and the quality, but almost docked a star because of price..
92104	these cubes are great for knits, small clothing items, underwear, socks, etc.  is your luggage always getting frisked by the tsa?  this makes the search much quicker/easier, and you're on the way.  changing hotels a lot? these cubes, along with the eagle creek envelopes and/or compression bags make moving around fast and easy - no unpacking/repacking, just throw everything in the carry-on. i can do 2 weeks in europe or a week on a business trip - all out of a carry-on, thanks to these great compression and organization products.
92109	good product carries my tai shoes for class and i can use when traveling so shoes don't soil my clothes.  very happy with product and quality with mesh to air shoes.boston babe
92146	i used this for a recent cruise and despite tsa shuffling the contents of my luggage, everything packed in the folder was not disturbed.  wrinkles were minimized by the items not being permitted to bounce around the inside of the suitcase.  i liked the shirt-folding template to make sure they were folded to the right size.  i would recommend this folder for those travelers wanting to minimize packing space.
92187	i like the fact that adding charms/beads is easy with the twist off end.  the lobster clasp, however, is very difficult to operate. maybe it is defective because the clasp is totally smooth on the top. there is nothing to hold on to for opening and closing...very annoying! i have to ask my husband to help put it on.
92188	this bracelet was the perfect size. the clasp is not the greatest. if you're looking to wear it occasionally it's fine, but the clasp doesn't close all the way & is sticky..
92202	nice quality. great gift. design and color are beautiful. great purchase, especially for the price. well-received by a picky clothing wearer.
92204	"this is a great scarf. it is fashionable, warm, and does not irritate. you can actually fold the scarf to ""change"" the colors that are exposed, which makes this a really flexible item. i am very happy with my purchase. the package also arrived very promptly."
92236	"this case is just the right size for my shaving stuff, etc.  it is very well made, but light weight.  several zippered compartments allow segregation of items for different uses.  i like that it stays upright, which is quite important in many small hotel bathrooms.i would like a few more straps in the center area--they could be folded back or used to hold things upright.  if you put something ""big"" into one of the side pockets, it will bulge out and interfere with the use of the pocket on the ""other side of the wall"".overall just right for me."
92289	i needed a flexible, cushioned boot to support my aging, arthritic feet. this timberland boot does the trick. the outsole is not stitched, so i don't expect them to last more than three years of regular wear, but for the price they are an outstanding value.
92353	the fit was good and slouchy as expected, however i found the length to be a little on the short side. also the color is listed as &#34;true black&#34; but even on arrival it seemed a bit faded. otherwise, really comfy cozy pullover.
92434	i hate writing bad reviews but .....this robe is comfy and soft, but it sheds and the sizes are waaaay off. i am an average girl, 5'6&#34;, 140 lbs and the small/med was too small, especially the sleeves.
92487	i have lived in apartment buildings with coin-operated washer and dryers for over 15 years.  i have been through multiple coin purses in that time.  and this is the best one i've found yet.  very sturdy and solid despite the wear and tear i've put it through.
92506	i have bought several of these and they have made very impressive gifts.  the pearls are not perfect but really nice for the money.  i got a set for myself also.  the only thing i think would make them better was if the clasp was easier to use and was non tarnish.  but like i said, for the money, a great buy.
92562	i reluctantly ordered these for my wife....because she does not like all slippers...but she loves these! i highly recommend them because they are soft, warm, and wash up nicely.
92589	i am happy to have found these socks. i didn't have to spend a lot of money for them.i will buy more socks from them.
92699	i had an accident on skiing and couldn't call anyone, my phone and my gps camera were both frozen solid. this thing kept me warm in subzero temperature for hours, don't want to even think what would happen if i didn't have it. the material is soft and have a nice feel. the shape is very comfortable and nicely hugs the face without pressure. 5 star recommendation
92751	quality seems excellent. great weight for summer wearing. seems like a &#34;long&#34; 29&#34; inseam. good price for men's dress pant.
92765	i was a little unsure of ordeing these site unseen, but was pleased. the material is very smooth, good fit, traditional haggar quality. i will be ordering a few more of these now that i have tried them.
92799	not a precision tool. it did work on two of my watches. i have only one more to try but not yet.it comes soaked in oil, i had to degrease it for use. packed like it will spend 100 years in a warehouse. i guess better that than arriving rusty. i don't know if there are better tools out there. but if there are i might consider upgrading.
92835	i wear flip flops every chance i can get since i hate shoes. my flip flops wear out very quickly. thus, i did a lot of searching and trying on sandals before i settled on these. i was told to get rainbows, but honestly, these are much more comfortable and much cheaper. they run really skinny, so you may want to get 1 size or 1/2 a size bigger than you normally do. however, the construction is great. the sole is all one piece, so you know it won't fall apart! they dry quickly after getting wet, too. i think this will be my new sandal to purchase every year!
92886	product was what i wanted and service was great and quick. would purchase this item again, the price was right
92921	they were smaller than i had pictured, but i had compliments from the  first time i wore them! very pretty!
92975	while the earrings i got did not have quite as much color as those shown on line, they are still quite pretty, and i think looked really good when i put them on for the first time.  i like them very much.
93055	i bought these for pool walking at the y. they are fine for things like that, and a day at the beach or some time in a hot tub. what is labeled as red is really more of an orange, but i knew that when i bought them. what i didn't know is that the trunks used white stitching that stands out from the trunks themselves. i would have preferred that the stitching blend in.the trunks are well made, though, and the fabric appears to be pretty durable. sizing for me was no problem, but i tend to be a pretty average size for most stuff. i have no idea what upset the one-star reviewer so much. maybe he was having a bad day, because the trunks really deserve a pretty good rating.
93111	i bought this wrist watch for this summer...i am sure i will enjoy wearing it because it looks beautiful on my wrist...i liked it so much i bought my daughter one who also likes it very much so there you have it!
93142	ordered this bra in my regular size, was way too small, had to return it.  they didn't offer any bigger sizes  :(
93160	buckle is a nice piece for the goth-look as well as a secure buckle.  i attached it to a brillant blue belt and it looked great.  i have it ready to mail along with a belt as a birthday gift.
93194	i purchased this product for my 13-year old daughter prior to a week-long family road trip. its got all of the essentials in it, so you don't have to make the rounds to the stores to pick up items to fill it. yes, it is a utilitarian item. it's not a beauty kit or a luxury kit by any means. it is a simple, cost-effective method of getting the items you need for a family vacation, a camping trip, or a longish business trip. unless you are a frequent traveler that needs something a bit more rugged, this is really the way to go.in case you were wondering, there is a men's version of this kit, as well. i purchased this one for my 11-year old son:handy solutions, 10 pc. premium men's travel kit
93203	i'm in my late 20s and have outgrown low-rise jeans. like many of the reviewers here, i'm tired of jeans that show crack or create muffin top. i've looked far and wide for a pair of jeans that sat at the waist and didn't look like &#34;mom jeans&#34; or gap at the waist. the 525s are the solution i've been seeking. these look awesome and feel great. i ordered another pair in a different color. i will never buy another pair of jeans again. size was accurate, but i wish they offered them in long. another 1/2 inch or so would cover my ankles when seated, but this is a problem i have with all jeans and not a fault with the 525s.
93355	"i am so surprised by the other reviews that say ""true to size."" i usually wear a women's small top and size 4 pants. i ordered three of these tees in small. they look like a little girl's shirt. in fact, i gave them to my friend's daughter, who is ten years old! the shirt was exactly what i wanted in that it was extra long to cover your rear and nice and stretchy. so i am going to order again trying a large."
93357	ladies white plain sport t-shirt round neck cap sleeves, cotton spandex. this shirt fits great. it is made of quailty material. if you choose your correct size accordingly, then, you should have no problems with the fit.
93388	i did read the reviews on these boots before buying them...they are really cute and warm, but yikes, do they rub on my heels, even with thick socks!! i really needed them when they came, so i kept them, but while breaking them in i put a chunk of foam in the bottom so it wouldn't rub directly on my heel. that seems to be working fine...they are tough to break in and don't bend well at the ankle. if you have trouble with heel rubbing in other shoes (i do) i would pass these up for sure and go with something else. but they are warm enough and water proof enough for the coldest mn winters!
93444	i was on the hunt for a new laptop bag, the one my work provided me was black, huge, and squeaky.  i saw this bag got fairly good reviews so i took a chance and ordered it. so glad i did! it came today in the mail-- only 2 days after i placed my order!! was packaged nicely, also all of the metal parts on the bag were wrapped with tissue paper. this bag is going to be extremely functional & i'm so excited about the side bottle holder--my camelbak fits perfectly! the strap is easily adjustable--to wear either over your shoulder or as a crossbody. also i will say that the original picture features a khaki color then when i went to the checkout page the color of the bag portrayed a yellowish color (which i was hoping it wouldn't be). it's definitely the khaki color! i'd say it even has a hint of green to it. this bag is very durable & surprisingly light for being &#34;heavy-duty.&#34; i also could not be more pleased with the price! all the other bags i was browsing were $40-$50. this was a steal!! it's the perfect functional bag to add some style to my daily work wardrobe i'm so excited to use it!
93449	love this bag. it's just what i wanted, exactly as advertised. must buy for the price. i got the classic army green and the color is a little more muted than the picture (though my mom has the white one and it looks quite a bit like it's picture) but it looks great.
93472	bought a half size larger to get the width but as with most chinese made shoes they're way too narrow for americans.... the foot bed is just too narrow
93510	these are very light shoes but without much air flow so they are hot.  they do not provide lateral support.  they can be worn for errands but should not be used for exercise or walking any distance.
93545	this belt is wonderful!  very thick and strong.  beautifully made and doesn't fall apart or bend out of shape right away.  in other words made the way things should be made.  i love it!
93576	i was looking for a nice classic leather belt that will wear well with jeans and other casual pants.  i stumbled across this one, and went ahead and ordered a large (i'm a size 10/12).  my only regret is that i wish i had ordered a medium since i am on the second to smallest hole currently and that leaves a decent bit of extra belt hanging off.  however, the belt is just about perfect.the leather has held up very well, and it does not seem as prone to bending in the back middle as some of my previous belts (bonded leather) have done in the past.  it fits very comfortably, and keeps me from constantly tugging my jeans up, as they start to slide down my hips after i've worn them for a bit.my pre-conceived notion of carhartt was that it was a rugged brand, but this belt looks very smart with a pair of black jeans and a sweater.  i love that i can transition a jeans belt to slacks and have it adapt to the outfit.  it doesn't draw a lot of attention, but that wasn't what i was looking for in this belt.  the price is only slightly more than the cheap belts that they sell in many stores, but i can tell that it is made out of leather and not the bonded crud that starts to crack and fall apart after a few wears.  i will say that this belt has made me keen to try other belts from this brand and i would highly recommend this, just order a size smaller if you are on the fence of which size to go with.
93666	received my carhartt belt today and i must admit i was not blown away!!! i'm not sure which asian country carhartt has manufacturing their belts these days, but they are surely not the carhartt belts of 15 years ago!!!!
93797	"i looked at belts for quite a while before selecting the carhartt men's anvil belt.  i sought out reviews and viewed photos of the product using the magnifier, just to see what kind of construction they had.  i was impressed, to say the least.  these belts are genuine leather and solid pieces, not thin strips with paper fillers sewn together.  very impressive.  the buckle construction is chunky and heavy, very durable.  all-in-all, a belt i wish i could wear.  i am at the weird end of the spectrum body-type-wise, and am quite skinny.  i have a 30"" waist and this belt, as nice as it is, just doesn't fit me.  carhartt belts all start at 34"" and go up from there.  so, even on the last hole position, it's still just a bit too big, and it leaves a lot of extra belt to have to tuck in.  so, i gave it to my son who has a 32"" waist and it fits him great!  he loves it.  i just wish carhartt would make belts for us small guys!  i love their products and wear the men's twill work pants everyday!  that's what got me to looking at more of their product line, the pants are excellent, so maybe other carhartt products are good too.  and they are.  just not my size.  oh well.  hope this helps you.  the belt is very nicely constructed and well finished, but you better have a 32"" waist or larger to be able to wear it."
93993	i've done a couple gym workouts and one 3mile treadmill run and so far, i am in love. amazing. cushioning is phenomenal especially at the ball of your foot. offset laces feel a little better to me since it relieves pressure off the top bony part of your foot. support through the heel is great and my feet feel very stable like they would be good for cross-country running as well. good support through the sides too since i slightly over-pronate on the left and over-supinate on the right. i have very difficult-to-fit problem feet and i am very happy with these shoes. definitely worth the price.update- after running in these for over a year, i was forced to replace them with the nimbus 14s. i've been disappointed in the changes. the 12s were perfect and the 14s just do not measure up. if i could find the 12s in my size anywhere, i'd buy out the store.
94060	i've been buying asics since at least 2001 because of two things - the under-ankle arch is low and the shoes are comfortable.i bought these to replace my most recent asics which i've had since 2009.  i don't wear them every day but the tread is practically gone so figured it was time to replace them.  these shoes are awful because:1) the ankle arch it too high, or rather it is normal high.  my ankles are slightly lower than normal so when i find a shoe that fits correctly i stick with it.  even with gel inserts in the back of the shoe they still rubbed the underside of my ankle.2) the shoe itself was not very comfortable.  my feet hurt after only an hour of wearing them and i found the old shoes to be bouncier.  i also ended up with a blister on my foot after wearing them for one day.on the plus side, the shoes did feel lighter by comparison and the design is standard so it's not ugly.  if anyone wants a barely used pair of 7.5's let me know.
94065	i have had a difficult time trying to find a shoe that doesn't hurt my left foot that i broke a couple of years ago. i have been through new balance, avia, propet, etc.  the asics, this shoe in particular is the most comfortable shoes i have ever tried and have ordered a second pair as a back up. with all the others, at the end of the day i was anxious to remove my shoes.  however, with these, i can wear them all day and my feet are not even sore at the end of the day.
94094	yes, i knew this was a big hat but i was still dumbfounded by it's size when i took it out of the box.  that isn't a bad thing, but just understand that this isn't a casual throw it on wear anywhere hat.  if you want to hit the beach without dragging your umbrella though, this throws all the shade you need ;)
94097	it didnt look good on me at all. i think it was just really big and really floppy. i wish they had different sizes.
94115	bought to take to hawaii - packs up so nicely and doesn't show wrinkles.  i wanted to get a brightly colored one, but black just goes with everything.  i thought it might be hot, but it wasn't.  great purchase.
94146	my 3 year old is into pirates hardcore right now thanks to jake and the neverland pirates. so i couldn't pass this eye patch up and i am so glad i got it. he plays with it constantly!
94151	i was little disappointed because i thought the heart would be bigger.  it is very tiny, but i love it for the price i paid for it.
94194	this bra did not fit . it has a weird shape and just did not fit. perhaps it is trying to cover more than it can or perhaps the lack of wires is a mistake for this bra. i returned it.
94200	i have always had a very hard time finding a bra. i would try on a thousand bras and walk out discouraged from not finding a single one that fit well. i have spent tons of $ going to professional places to be fit and even those are not as comfy.i went on a whim and purchased a barely there gotcha covered wirefree from a retailer in white. i fell in love with the bra and went back and purchased several more in all the colors i could get (white and nude only). since then i have been searching for black and was so happy to find them on amazon.this bra fits great without smooshing the girls. it does not leave any side arm fat from spilling over the bra and does not slip! i have had problems in the past with bras slipping in the straps and cups even with great fitting bras. this is the first bra i have not had to adjust during the day and i have even slept in it forgetting i had it on.i wash my bras in a bra garment bag but rarely put them on delicate with the bag. i use tide he and they have held up perfectly for years.i would highly suggest this bra - fantastic fit!(i am 5'2&#34;, 130lbs, 34c, short waisted)
94202	if you want little coverage, just enough to not look as if you're not wearing one; then this bra is for you.
94208	they look good and the spotshield is a life saver. one of my daughters is notorious for getting gunk on her clothes in the oddest places and these always come home looking as nice as they left.
94209	i bought this for my wife who works at wal martshe likes how the shirt feels and movesit has worn and washed wellas a grocery stocker she gets product spilled on her almost nightlythis shirt has cleaned up well and after 6 washes looks new (no fading or pilling)
94219	nice looking, well made, but no true to size....i ordered large, but it felt more like a medium and way to small on bust area. too bad, because i would have ordered more in future.
94252	this is a pretty scarf its a little more gold then shown in the picture and depending on light the detail is not as noticeable but its still very pretty. need to get the fold lines out of it but it is still very nice.
94270	"love these! really pretty. well made. the clasps are strong and don't come open too easily(which is good). being 8"" is great because you can put more beads on them! they're very comfortable too."
94272	not what i needed or wanted. will not order again.  has very odd way to close bracelet. will not order again.
94285	nice jacket loved it the day i got it fit fine looked very good but the zipper broke within a week  of wearing it an i'm a grown man so it wasn't abused cheap plastic zipper
94286	i bought this jacket because it claimed to be waterproof...and i can say without regret that it is.i stood outside in a rainstorm to test it,and i came in dry as the desert.it is a worthy purchase..
94320	i was really surprised that this jacket was as big as it was.  i am a pretty big guy that is pretty comfortable in xxl shirts and was expecting for this to fit large on me as i wanted to wear it over a fleece or other light jacket.  i had to return the xxl for an xl.  the xl fits very well on me over my fleece.  it looks very well and i have gotten many compliments.i was looking for a higher quality jacket that was not bulky, that could be worn over a soft shell or other light jacket and one that could repel water.  this is what i got.  i have only had it for a few days, but so far i am very pleased.
94358	"columbia men's watertight jacket in sage is a good rain jacket to protect you in wet environments. i live in the desert where it rarely rains but when it does it tends to come in a very heavy downpour. i have had this jacket for three months at the time i am writing this review. last week we had 5 days of solid rain which gave me ample opportunity to put this jacket to the test. first, i will say it kept me completely dry which is the ultimate reason for a rain jacket. this jacket tends to come very large so i highly recommend buy one size smaller than normal. i ordered one size smaller and it fits relatively well. if i would have purchased my normal size this jacket would be way too big even if i were wearing a bunch of layers underneath.following are some of my thoughts on this jacket:wet environment:columbia men's watertight jacket kept me completely dry in a very heavy downpour over a five day period. this included windy conditions. the hood is very functional and you are able to cinch it tight to help keep rain off your face.cold environment:this is definitely not a cold weather jacket. i would say it is comfortable down to 50-60 degrees if you don't have on any base layers and it is not windy. any colder than 50 degrees and you will want some layers to provide added warmth. i will say that utilizing layers in conjunction with this jacket kept me reasonably comfortable down to 35 degrees.windy environment:this jacket is not windproof and again you will benefit from wearing layers to help keep the wind from dropping your core body temperature. without layers the wind seems to cut right through this jacket.breathability:i did not find the jacket to be very breathable and think there is some room for improvement. because i will not be using this jacket often this will not be an issue for me. if i were using this jacket often i would upgrade to a jacket that breathes better.size/storage:as stated previously this jacket comes very large so order one size smaller for best fit. the jacket itself is very easy to compress and store. it comes with a storage pocket that is easy to use and convenient.look/style:i really like the look and style of the jacket. the sage color is great and works well in a desert environment especially if you are looking to ""blend in"" as opposed to ""standing out.""complaints:my biggest compliant with this jacket is the zipper. i have had the zipper separate a couple of times. fortunately it did not break and fixed itself when i unzipped the jacket. under heavy use i would have concerns about the zipper holding up.the jacket has a layer to cover the zipper which buttons closed. the buttons are plastic and again i would be concerned about their durability over the long haul. i am not a huge fan of plastic buttons due to the potential and actual lack of durability.overall assessment:columbia men's watertight jacket is what i would classify as a ""light duty"" jacket that performs reasonably well. in cold and windy environments you will need to layer your clothing for added protection. this jacket fits my needs perfectly and i would recommend it to others for sporadic or light use. because i live in the desert with little rain i will not be using this jacket very often. if i were in a normally wet environment i would probably go with a higher quality heavier duty jacket that will handle more wear and tear."
94395	"these a very thin cotton cloth pant with a minimun of texture. they are certainly not ""canvas"". they are thinner than some chino's i have. the pant also rides low below the waist --not slightly lower. for a work pant this is a disaster. it defeats the roomy seat since they are already low --plumbers beware! the dark green collects dust and lint so immediately look dirty- work, i think not. these will not do the job.these are not the heavy canvas outdoor carhartt you see at the store. i've never seem carhatt like them before-- looks like china and the lords of profit maybe at work here. order a size larger than you normally would as well --they run small."
94430	comfortable and inexpensive. i'm a 34c and bought an s. don't expect sculpting and support like a wired bra and you'll be fine.
94450	this is a comfortable bra, considering it has only one measurement.  there is a reason bras have two measurements, one for the band and one for the cups.  i had to use a bra extender and the cups were way too low on the sides so that the girls spilled out the sides.  that said however, if it fits you, it is a very soft and very comfortable bra.
94491	not a bad shirt for working, a few flaws in the manufacturing which are noticable. a good heavy weight material that washes out very well.
94536	i forgot to give my size. oh ooh my bag. the product is wounderful and i am quit large and next time i want to order a bigger size if possible.  thankchampion women's shape t-back sports brayou
94563	one of my favorite pair of shorts but always had trouble finding them.  fit well and like the longer 11&#34; inseam
94566	i like the overall shape and the pockets seemed fine. the waist is small for its size and the waist closure uses a snap instead of a button; fine for some but not my preference.
94579	"i got this jacket as rain-gear for camping - it's lightweight, packs into it's own pocket (doubles as a camping pillow when dry!) and used it twice for rain outside.  with a light sweater under it, this coat kept me dry and warm even in 35f weather (i'm a girl who tends to get cold very easily).  outside pockets are warm and zip against the rain; inside pocket is deep and secure (velcro closure).  top outer pocket is handy for id or cash / credit cards.  adjustable velcro on the sleeves and drawstring at hood and at bottom hem let you adjust the coat to fit it any way you like.  this is my new holy grail throw-on jacket - it's light enough to use in the spring and summer (has breathable inner lining), but also is warm enough to layer and use in fall and winter.  my partner said, ""we should use that when we go skiing"" - it would work great for that too.  secure front zipper also has snap closures to cover against the rain.  great jacket!  so worth the money, and half as expensive as other jackets!  very glad i got it."
94690	i have had so many compliments on these shoes.  they are so very comfortable and easy to keep clean.  thanks again, amazon, for the convenience and money-saving rewards of shopping online with you.
94692	would never wear these in an office/work environment unless we were very business casual. i use them for walking to work so my good shoes don't get damaged. i also wear them socially with jeans or khakis and am satisfied for what i got for the price. seem very durable and are comfortable.
94765	these were a good price and were what i hoped for in terms of quality, material, and size.  they appear to be a little wider and flatter in the photograph but mine had a much more curved shape when viewed head-on.
94801	these are even prettier than the picture. the ovals move independently of each other. they are light weight and do not make a lot of noise. the bag they come with is nice and will come in handy when i travel.
94897	at first he didn't like it everything was tight but now that he has used it some it is getting use to it and some of the things aren't as tight. so he likes it and has lot of room for everything.
94911	nicely made somewhat dressy shorts.  comfortable and appear well made.  the front pockets have good capacity and are comfortable.  the one drawback is the utility pocket on the right side is uncomfortable if you put anything in it then try to sit down.
94923	the picture shows a well-fitted bandeau, but it's actually very small. would not consider it unless you are a size 32a. was a waste of my money, unfortunately.
94945	i ordered this ring on a thursday afternoon, it was shipped from ny and reached la (where i live) tuesday!  this ring is stunning, for what i paid for it. but do agree with some of the other buyers that upon very close inspection it is obvious it is not real! but neither the less it sparkles and puts a smile on my face whenever i look at it! i would recommend this ring to anyone and if you want something that looks exactly like the real thing then i would spend a few hundred more and buy a diamonique stone!
94951	this is the best looking ring i have ever seen. love wearing it all the time. only thing i would have liked better would be a round band and not the squarish one that all fake jewel rings seem to come with - but that is just a personal preference.  just love it!!! it looks so much better in reality.
95000	i received these sunglasses from my hubby for my birthday.  i absolutely love them!  they are very chic and stylish.  i have a small face and they fit me perfectly!
95008	have gotten alot of compliments when i wear this hooded top.  it really looks nice with a long sleeve white t-shirt underneath.
95017	i had read a review saying order 2 sizes up. i am a 2x normally. after reding that review i ordered a 4x. boy was she ever right! and because of this i love love love this top. i would own this in many colors. great length. very very comfortable and flattering.
95019	it fits very well, maybe a little on the large size. it is very comfortable and a nice walk around blouse that is also a little sexy.
95023	i normally wear a large or x-large (42&#34; bust), so i ordered the 1x and it fits perfectly.  very figure flattering for curvy girls.  i wore it with black jeans and flats and got lots of compliments.  it arrived quickly, too.  i'm glad i found evogues.  trendy clothes that fit well at reasonable prices - not easy to find on-line!  two thumbs up!
95040	i ordered up on this top but i think i could of just ordered the 1x and would have been fine but im ok with it i dont mind if its loose i still like it
95052	i also purchased this same shirt in deep grey.  my only problem once i got these shirts is the short, almost non-existant sleeves.  probably wouldn't have bought it had i known it had virtually no sleeves.
95128	"my orange purse arrived quickly and was exactly what i expected in terms of size and quality for the price. the color is somewhat of a ""dirty"" orange - not that the bag was unclean, the color is just slightly less bright than i expected - it has a sort of darker sheen over it. but all in all it is a decent bag that i don't expect to last more than one season or so."
95170	as little as two years ago, shoebuy carried brooks at much less than $100. with a coupon, you could get brooks sneakers for around $50 - $60. the quality is no better, but their marketing dept almost doubled the price. are they good - yes. are they worth the higher amount - no. brooks is an average sneaker in value, quality, and durability. they are not elite.
95233	my son is very happy with his new shoes. arrived on time and looks just like the picture. nice shoes.
95421	i ordered the size to match the measurements on the chart, but they arrived much too big.  the &#34;height&#34; on these is pretty crazy.- if you are looking for granny panties that go up to your bra, these may be for you.- if you are looking for normal briefs that don't encompass you're entire mid-section you should look elsewhere.
95512	you should be able to choose the colors/patterns you're getting.  these were odd.  i ordered according to my hip size and they fit around the hips, but they barely covered my rear (which is not particularly large) and the elastic rides up my cheeks.  i'll go back to my trusty jockeys.  they cost a little more, but they're worth it.
95590	i purchased these panties for my daughter's friend who went off to live on campus at college and discovered she had been robbed of most of her underwear by her sister!!  needless to say, i was able to come to her rescue with my wonderful amazon prime account.  these panties are the basic cotton bikini underwear and they will serve the purpose for which they were intended.  enough said?  highly recommend!
95595	these are the only undies my honey will wear! i love these because they look so great on him! they are a perfect fit and are super durable! they do not wear or get pilly between the legs like other brands.
95620	i must say, these boots are beautiful, sophisticated and classy without being over bearing.  these are my first justin boots, and they are lovely, the c wide size is perfect, plenty of room in the ball of the foot area;  i'm impressed with the heavy duty; on the bottom, you can walk a dirt driveway or into a nice restaurant and be just fine.  solid, well made.  i'm very happy with these boots, and recommend this version of this boot highly!  this is a perfect ladies boot.  i'll be getting a good use out of these.  just have to get used to seeing the pointy toe but that just me.update, i just bought the other pair shown here with the white trim, size 8.5 c for wide, they just came in the mail.  oh how nice, so comfortable.  i'll be walking in these a great deal.  softer than the others still leather.  the square toe is a little roomier than the pointed ones.  but i love them both!  highly recommended.  even if you baby a bunion.
95662	i love these underwear, they don't ride up, and they are soo supportive, i bought three more pairs, and eventually will have all my underwear be like these.
95717	"i am in the military and deployed to the middle east.  the humidity where i am at is a lot like the gulf coast in the states.  i wish i knew about these before.  i was recommemnd them by a friend because he said they  breathed more in humid climates. so i looked at them and was blown away that on base the go for $16 a pair and some department stores sell them for as high as $28 a pair.  so i bought a pair of the 9 inch and was so amazed that i bought a second pair of 9 inch and order 4 pair of the six inch from amazon.  supply in deployed location is very limited.  i perfer the 9 inch more because they dont ride up as much. how ever especially if your in humid enviorments these are worth the money and like it says on the box ""you will never where normal underwear again"" very true i have thrown away almost all my other cotton boxeres by hanes, hand will be buy at least 4 more pair of these!"
95768	by the placement and reviews, (on both amazon and zappos) i thought the yellow ones were for bikers- but they're just like the other colors. i don't see how these can be beneficial for cyclists, since we ride with the front of our feet on the pedals and all the support here is for the arch and back part of the foot. i recently started biking longer distances- and after 20-25 miles, my toes were splaying in my regular running shoes, even with gel inserts. unfortunately nobody makes bike shoes for wide feet (i wear a womens xw). not even mtb shoes. so i thought these might do the trick. but you definitely would not want to put a very wide foot over these inserts- i'd expect pain over the arch and blisters on the edge of the heel. most custom orthodics correct for pronation but don't provide front support like a biking shoe. going to have to bike long distances in hiking boots and keep looking for a better solution. all that said- if you don't have wide feet and you're looking for an insert for support in other sports, this may be a good one.
95794	i have searched many a store for what used to be a staple winter item.....wool gloves!!  not finding any here where i live, i went to my favorite online store, amazon and found exactly the right ones.  these are just perfect for keeping my hands warm, as i love to be out walking as much as possible throughout the winter.  i measured my hand as recommened and ordered them in small and they are a good fit.  i thought the price was very reasonable, also.a good purchase for me!  i hand wash these, no problem!
95819	i purchased this cami in black. it is well-made, fits great, and is true to size. i ordered this cami to wear under blouses with larger necklines (for those times when you don't want to show too much) and it works great for that purpose as the square lace neckline lays in just the right place.  this cami is also great for layering and for sleeping. it is soft and comfortable and it stays in place under your clothes. if i were a bit younger, i'd probably wear it as a regular tank-top with a black bra. i am going to purchase one or 2 more because i do enjoy sleeping in them. great find!
95829	i wanted a comfortable roomy cami that would not be binding and this is exactly what i received!  very pretty fabric; does not cling.  provides full coverage for those very sheer shirts/tops.  glad i bought this!
95888	fit was fine.  overall shoes were okay.  i was looking for something more dressy.  these are very casual shoes.  not for the office.  they are better suited for the shop, walking, or in an industrial setting.quality was fine though.  again fit was great.  a 12 fit my 12 foot fine.  keens are pretty accurately sized.
95925	this is a fun little ear & tail set for the cheshire cat. once you get it, it's a little cheaper than the pictures seem to show.  still fun and unique, tho.not part of the rating but interesting- this was delivered faster than i thought possible.
95952	they rolled slightly inward (medial) when i walked in them. had to return them. they look much cuter in picture. in person they're a little plain and boxy looking. some of the other clarks are great though. i just wouldn't recommend this style. they all run different from u.s. sizing. i generally wear 7.5b but take a 7c/d in clarks. they still don't feel exactly right on my feet--none of their sizes fit me very well. these run larger than the other clarks i've had.
95962	i have bought this type of shoe before, but not from keen. i am female with a low arch and borderline wide foot, and the women's styles sometimes don't fit. this fit perfectly, and it is pretty unisex, style-wise. i went one size down from my women's size, w11 to m10. i'm very happy with these, the estate blue is a beautiful color, a bit brighter then navy.***edit- i have had these for several monthes and still love them. if they were more feminine, i would wear them all the time. this week i took them to the poconos, and was very happy with how they felt while creek walking. i felt stable and my feet didn't tire out like they have in the past. i will always bring these with me for that, from now on, so mush better then other water shoes i have worn. keep in mind though, from soaking wet to dry takes at least 24 hours, longer if you don't have sun.
95975	these sandals are terrible!!! my son has worn other keen shoes without issue -- has actually loved them -- but this rubber material instead of the cloth/mesh straps on many of their sandals is just awful. it rubs, causes blisters, and is almost 'sticky'. like, if they're worn in water, it's like sand/dirt sticks to the rubber, causing even more friction/pain when trying to walk in them wet. while i'd recommend the keen brand, i'd never recommend or buy this particular product again. (keen sandals are great -- but seek out the cloth/fabric/mesh straps)
96035	i bought this present as a christmas gift for my mother, and after i got it, i wasn't sure if i wanted to give it to her. the necklace chain was cheap, and very short. the heart itself is very small, and words are so small, it makes it difficult to read. i ended up buying another nicer chain, and giving to my mother like that, but i still wish it was bigger...
96076	i got this necklace for a friend that definitely follows her own star so i thought this was appropriate. it is both inspirational and affirming and the design is cool and different.
96103	i love these heels !!!!!! i can not even count how many compliments i got on these. i love this tone which i can wear with alot of things. the best part is that i got them at such a steal. you will defintely turn heads with them.
96124	these are terrific casual pants.  exceptionally well made, generously cut and true-to-size.  haggar includes all the details of pricier dress slacks - well-finished seams, reinforced pocket linings - features not found in the competitors casual pants. the expandable waist feature is great for an active person because it eliminates binding and helps the pants keep their shape.  these pants were purchased for my son - i wish i could find slacks like this for women.
96125	i had bought a pair of &#34;string&#34; colored haggar khakis and totally love them--best pants i've had in years. i expected the same with these because i thought i ordered the same pants but different color--not! they're an inch too short; there is no crease whatsoever--whatever the material is, it absolutely won't hold a crease; they arrived filthy out of the plastic sealed package--it looked like someone had literally mopped the floor with them--dirt, dust, cat hair clumps; the zipper is cheap, cheap, cheap and already reluctant. i'd have sent them back but it's just too much of a hassle.
96131	they sorta fit in the waist,but were quite long,so i returned them...i guess i'll have to make the ll bean's work a little longer.
96135	the shorts are what i expected, given past experience with carhartt.  the other reviewer was right about it being long enough for tall guys.  i am pretty tall, and the length is perfect in that it covers my legs all the way to the knees, but not below.  i carry a limited number of tools, and a telephone, and constantly get in and out of a vehicle, for my job and these have very well designed pockets for carrying a few hand tools, out of the way so they don't stab the truck seat.  the truly unique and excellent features of carhartt are attention to detail, and sparing no expense for quality.  however, i hope i haven't spoken too soon, as we shall see how long they last.
96278	these are really comfortable and durable boots. my son wore his almost constantly for a couple years and didn't want anything else to replace them. they don't collect dirt to track in or get smelly. they look nice and hold up under constant wear. amazon had best price. arrived in timely manner.recommend
96367	"as mentioned in the title, the pant is really comfortable, but for my 5'5"" and 125plbs, it is a bit too loose."
96373	these got runs in them the first time i pulled them on. pretty flimsy in my opinion. i guess you get what you pay for.
96388	these fit as expected, for over a medium size pair of glasses.  so far they have held up. they are polarized, and they look good too.  not too big and tacky but not too small to fit over a medium pair of glasses.
96471	my 6 yr old loves these! they are comfortable and easy to get on and off. cool colors and design. they look awesome on him!
96542	i love these!!! i wear between an 8.5-9 and have a wide foot. these fit like a dream and look super cool. yay!!!
96563	i am narrow through my shoulders and larger around my middle so i have to buy tops and dresses that fit over my middle which often makes them too big in the shoulders. i didn't want to look like i was wearing the hanger but just enough to keep the shoulders from drooping. these slim line shoulder pads did the trick. they fit easily with bra straps and stay in place. i gave them 4 stars because they tear easily if you are not very careful when removing your top.
96598	i guess they're okay for the price, but i thought they'd be a bit sturdier. plus i can't wear them when it's cold outside because it's easy to get your ears snagged on coat collars or scarves. i don't think i'd buy those again.
96644	beautifully designed dress (i bought the black.) gorgeous material, too! but... i bought the large (like i buy for all my dresses, whether form fitting or loose) and i could barely get into it and maintain my dignity. i believe that it runs too small. if you usually wear size 12-14 dresses (i wear size 12) and you are like me with curvy hips and bottom, then this dress will definitely make you look like a street walker...if you can get into it. three star rating only because i believe that a large dress should fit like a large and not like a small.
96696	the product is excelent shock absorber but comes a little bit too tight even after adjusting to the right position
96712	this bra is the worst.  i would have to be double jointed in order to be able to get it fastened.  i was excited about this bra because it came in an f cup, but that didn't make any difference.  it's very difficult to fasten.  i would like it better if it slipped over my head.  i don't recommend this item to anyone.
96713	i'm a 34e & often am extremely disappointed with sports bra's (i always bounce). this kept bounce to a minimum but it wad very difficult to get on (very frustrating.... & i am very flexible).  it aldo seems to run a tiny bit smaller than others by this brand.
96752	these are the hottest, sexiest shoes in my closet and the amazing thing is how comfortable they are..i get amazing comments, i love these shoes  katherine kelly
96828	this sunglasses case is lovely and functional. it's not too thin, but thin enough to be convenient, and the button works very well. it's also extremely beautiful. overall, i am happy with my purchase
96842	i wanted a soft sunglasses case , and this is perfect. the hard sided cases take up too much room in my purse. all the colors are great
96843	i've ordered several of these. once the first order arrived, i was hooked and knew i'd be ordering more. some of the patterns don't particularly appeal to me, but the ones that do - wow! great service both when ordering for amazon to fulfill and directly from old shanghai online. i haven't had any trouble with the knotted closure, but i see potential for that being the first to go. some are tighter than others, therefore there a variation in how easy they are to use. these would serve even more purposes if the closure was for the entire end, but they are charming and useful in their current configuration.  the look of the knot is a big draw. as with all products in this line, seeing a sample of the actual fabric designs is very helpful in making selections. far superior to going just on the name of a color. a small zippered pocket that could hold a few coins or perhaps an id would be a nice addition, but these nicely do the job of protecting glasses just as they are.
96862	these are not near the quality of muranco glass beads!!!  it is infuriating that this manufacturer can claim this product is murano glass when it is sub-par glass.  these are terrible beads with quite a few misshapen and faded or ugly coloring.  there doesn't seem to be any quality control in this company.  i hope that no one else wastes their money like i did.
96866	i like the glassy colors of these beads and they were all different.  they worked well in my project and i'd order again.
96937	these run one size big. i wear a 10 and could definitely fit in a 9. other than that they are really comfy and cute. the toe is less square than the picture shows.
96975	i wore this hat on a trip to northern ireland where it rained almost every day.  it kept my hair and face dry.  i was very pleased with the purchase.  it is well made and of good quality materials! i would recomend this to anyone in the market for a rain hat.  no messing with umbrellas with this hat!
96986	this is a really nice and beautiful set. just received mine today. the shipment arrived way before the estimated time period. very pretty, i love it. just wanted something more blingy to replace my original set for now until i upgrade in a few years. just wish the center stone would of been around a half carot instead of a carot. but besides that i absolutely love it.
97024	i was so excited when my new wrapped crocs arrived.  they are so cute, unlike most of the regular croc styles, so i can actually wear these out.  due to a problem with my foot, i have to wear very supportive soft shoes and these were wonderful.  the shoes were so comfortable that i even wore them to dance class.once drawback is that they are pretty narrow for crocs.  they do stretch, but if you have a very wide foot, they may not be for you.  i normally wear a wide shoe and haven't had a problem fitting in to crocs so far, but these just fit.
97054	the perfect boot for me...light weight yet warm.  i can't wait for the first snow! the sizing is right on.  thank you for this great, comfortable boot!
97095	cute, comfy shoe with nice wide toe box and good support.  slides on the heel a bit, but a heel grip will take care of that.  waiting for the black ones to go on sale!!!
97102	i love this shoe, comfortable from the first time i put them on.  very comfortable i can wear them with my work uniform or with jeans and they fit very well and yet give my toes somer oom to breath i would give them 10 stars if i could
97108	unlike keen's wichita model, these shoes offer little support. also, 'frosted' finish on leather is a bit too much for me. will exchange for another wichita.
97122	i love the exofficio undies. this is they only ones i wear, trips or at home. they wash quickly on trips. they are comfortable in the florida or utah sun. they dry fast, and are treated with aegis microbe shield to control odor causing bacteria. normally i get them via amazon prime and they are here in two days. this time i bought just from amazon and they never arrived before my trip and then amazon cancelled one of the four (to ship faster). amazon did notify me that they were going to be delayed. this was winter and there were storms. i give the product five stars because the product is wonderful.  you rate the seller separate from the product. i never buy undies (or pantyhose)  smaller than i need and squeeze in. so as i gain or lose weight i get a different size.  they have a similar product with a lace top. i like the looks of the lace top much much better, but they are not secure and fall off (oops!). again that is a different product.  these do stay up. they have survived many washings. i use a regular washer and dryer at home, and wash in sink sometimes when traveling. i have super sensitive skin due to radiation and they do not bother me. these are great for hiking. i wear them kayaking too. if they get wet they dry fast.  i love them!
97144	i like it because it's comfortable. it fits as expected (a little on the granny panties side rather than bikini). only give is that my panty liner doesn't stick.
97156	"i was hesitant to buy these after reading that they may shrink in the dryer or that they do not hold up well.  i wash and throw them in the dryer, and they are fine.  i have only had them for about a month, but so far they still look new.  i bought a few more pairs.  i usually wear barely there or garments from soma, but these are comparable in comfort and are better priced.  love them so far.**four months later and the underwear still look new. i am planning on buying more soon.  they are not ""pretty"" with lace like the undergarments i usually buy from soma or victoria's secret, but they are more comfortable and have that ""barely there"" feel to it which i love."
97238	i'm not paying over $1.50 per pr. of socks  because i wear them out  & am am not a pro athlete. these are not too thin. did not want big thick bulky ones and even have some fairly thin black ones for shoes that have a back in them. thick wont work for that. i love hanes tees and socks.
97250	nice made in usa boot in thick leather with good thick sole.  very stiff for a long time, but also nice strong seams and very good looks for a long time.  i put three coats of mink oil on when i bought these, and the boots still look like new one year later even though my husband wears them almost every day.  laces are very long, we replaced his once already.
97263	at first these were comfortable, but after a couple of hours they became like rocks. i bought two different kind of cushioning inserts and nothing helped. i do have a neuroma on one foot, so that i could understand, but this was both feet. i had to buy a different kind of boot. these may work for you, but i sure didn't enjoy them.
97286	got this for our four year old grandson.  he plays with it on the lakeshore, uses it to water tomatoe plants on the dock, and puts a string on it to pull it along side the dock.  he loves it!
97367	"this dress fits me perfectly! fit just like model in the photo. i am about 5'1"" and slender. but i have 36c's. this dress hugs ur body so if you have a curvy shape to you, this dress will look amazing on you!"
97370	"there seems to be a bad batch of these exofficio string bikinis on the market that have been mis-labeled.  i ordered a few mediums in black, nude and wine and received what appeared to be small or xtra-small panties with the medium label.  amazon was quick to exchange and 2 of the 3 replacements were correctly labeled.as i fall between size small and size medium, i can order either size and still be ok.  after reading other reviews here and other places online, i decided to order the medium just-in-case the string would dig into my hips and cause an unsightly (and possibly painful) visible pinch.  for those that are very toned in the hip area and not susceptible to pinching, there is no need to order up.my main complaint with this string-bikini style is that while they provide ample room for butt-coverage, it creates slight wrinkles in the fabric along the bum-elastic which translates to a very very visible panty line.  if i sized-down, the vpl was not as obvious but i ended up with a slight visible ""pinch"" line at the hips instead.  in conclusion, the fit of this panty depends very much on how toned one is at the hip area where the string-waistband goes and the shape of your butt and whether that shape can smoothly stretch-out the elastic to prevent wrinkling.this panty is as comfortable as their classic bikini, winks sweat, hardly feels that it's there but is tricky to fit."
97382	i spend 2 nights a week away from home for work. this bag is a godsend. it fits everything and then my laptop too! and i have a widescreen. on top of its functionality, it's super cute, constantly getting complimented and comfy to carry.
97394	i was looking for a plain black belt which could be adjusted tight enough to hold slacks up but not develop cracks in the leather, a problem i have had with locally bought belts.  this belt was indeed a plain looking belt and did not appear to have the shiny finish which would crack.  unfortunately the fit was not quite right, the first belt too short and the second was just not what i wanted.  ultimately i returned both for full refund.
97433	the bracelet is shiny and seems to retain its shine after having been worn quite a bit, through the shower, at work, in the kitchen and it is not as chunky or heavy as i thought it might be, but still feels comfortable when being worn. the clasp is a little awkward to use but is secure once you get it.i found this bracelet not bad value for the money, but i would not like to pay any more than the price asked.d
97480	these socks are very comfortable and durable.  i liked that they came in different colors to go with my different outfits.  i would purchase from this vendor again and would recommend this site to my friends.
97496	i love the color (black and smoke) and the size of these sunglasses. they are durable and look absolutely fantastic!
97497	i could see my eye reflection which i dislike.i don't think. it is polarized. if it is i shouldn't see my eye reflection!the shape is not so good, it touches my cheek bones.overall i don't hate it but i don't love it. color is nice.if i were u i'd look for a better pair with lower price.
97511	i loved this skirt when i saw it online. i ordered a bit big hoping that it would fit a little loose. sadly, i was disappointed in the fit. make sure you order a little bigger than your normal size.
97539	i loved the skirt until i turned sideways in the mirror and saw that the front was much longer than the back. i turned it around to see if  my bum would even it out and it did, which should never happen with a skirt. but when laid flat you could easily see how the edge wasn't straight at all, it kind of had a wave effect going on. also, i ordered the medium. i'm about a 6, give or take an inch for style and brand, and this skirt sat right on my natural waist and wouldn't have left much room, so be warned. mostly, i wouldn't chance it because of the tailoring. i was really bummed, but at least i didn't have to pay to return it!
97544	i think this skirt is extremely cute and can go with many blouses. i'm 5'2 and i got a small, and it fit very well. it came down to just below my knees, but i guess it depends on the length of your legs. i read some of the other reviews though, and i think before you buy it you should read the measurements and also it wouldn't hurt to measure yourself. overall, i'm very glad i bought this skirt; it can be casual or dressy.
97611	though my wife has tested this and commended it, but she has not really worn it. maybe by the time she wears it, i can now give this a proper rating. but for now she says its ok.
97652	loved the skirt but had to return it for a medium then the medium was like the small. the small fits but was too fitted and too sexy for a church meeting and so was the medium. lol so i got a little more space and correct measurements when making the skirt would be nice. the material is study and i cannot see through it like the white skirt i got from victoria secret which was way more cash. i got this skirt in purple and another in brown. i will go 3 sizes up this time. i wear a small in everything else was this is way off.
97665	"i read all the reviews but was sure this skirt would fit me since i'm pretty petite (5' 4"", 118 pounds and curvy).  i love the mermaid shape and the gores, but the proportions are very odd and the skirt is cheaply made. the small fit perfectly in the waist, but was way too tight in the hips.the medium is too large and gappy in the waist, but the hips (while quite snug), do fit.  however, some of the gores were poorly cut/sewn and create little ""bubbles"" of fabric at the hips. the skirt was wadded up tightly in a small box and is so wrinkled that ,even after steaming it twice during morning showers, the wrinkles have not come out at all.i have the medium hanging in my closet and i'm hoping the wrinkles will work themselves out so i can get a better idea of the fit.  but the medium will most likely be returned, too.this is why i only buy clothes on amazon that offer free shipping and free returns! i love amazon and make regular purchases using my husband's amazon prime account. i'm glad i'll be able to return this skirt at no cost."
97688	the picture shown here is misleading, the green is not as bright and a darker tone closer to forest green. the image on here gives off the impression it is a bright kelly green but it isn't. i did choose it because i figured it was going to be a bright green but in seeing how it is darker, it works at better for me at least, it is less obnoxiously loud as one could say. the fit is just right for someone like me and when the warmer months arrive, i am sure it will comfortable to wear too.
97734	this is my first pair of shape-ups.  they are wonderful.  i have arthritis in my toes and plantar fasciatis and these are super comfy.  i do a brisk walk twice a day and these are the only shoes in which my feet don't hurt.  i highly recommend them and they look nice too, not like big frankenstein shoes, like i was afraid they would look.  i think these are true to size.  i wear a size 11 womens.
97741	"i've had a pair of these shoes in blue/silver for a few months now. i like them so much i'd wear them everywhere if i could get away with it.  i don't know if my muscles are getting any special toning from walking in these, but i do know that my feet, knees and hips are comfortable. i wear these shoes for intense 3+ mile workouts on a treadmill and for casual wear. i like the appearance of the xf version of shape-ups, because the sole has a lower and less clunky profile than the original shape-ups styles. (that said, i also have a pair of the original shape-ups, in a solid black leather ""work"" shoe, that i wear for my shifts in a volunteer activity where i stand and walk for hours at a time. they are also very comfortable and my feet and knees aren't hurting even after a long day.)last week i got another pair of shoes in the shape-ups xf line, a similar style to this one, in black. so i can ""sneakily"" wear them with black trousers where silver sneakers would be inappropriate, but a nice black leather lace-up shoe would be acceptable.obviously, shoe fit is a very individual thing, but i would recommend that anyone try the shape-ups, because i've had such good experience with them."
97770	beautiful form fitting item, i bought a medium but i am petite so it is high waisted for me. comfortable fit not too tight, flexible and good material.
97822	"when i selected this bag, i wanted something that was large and roomy, perfect for spring break in florida. i wanted to be able to throw my phone, ipod, my kindle or my new ipad, along with my ""girlie"" essentials into one cute, fashionable and practical tote. (although this is way too much to carry around and too heavy. but that is what i had in mind when i ordered it.) anyway, i ordered this large zippered tote in dark brown and this was absolutely perfect. i love it.the silver accents go well with the dark chocolate faux leather. the bag is large, with tons of compartments/pockets and the lining is really cute (tan and brown). there are even ""taps"" on the bottom that doesn't allow it to sit directly on the floor. and while i haven't had the bag long, it appears to be well constructed and durable. i think it would perfect for the on-the-go mother (perfect for a few diapers and a bottle), or the on-the go student (perfect for an organizer or student essentials). i wholeheartedly give this bag a 5. it was exactly what i wanted and arrived in a timely manner in great condition."
97911	this is a very lovely shoe. the heel is not too high or spikedand the shoe is very comfortable right out of the box.  iordered it 1/2 size larger (but not wider) because of thereviews of others stating it ran a little small.  it fitsperfectly.  it is well made and has a leather upper. also,it was on sale and i had some extra amazon rewards pointsso i got it for less than thirty dollars. i bought it in red.
97966	i agree with other reviewers that at first it's tricky to get on and off, but once you figure it out you feel silly that you had such a hard time with it! i took it to a jewelry store in town to remove a link because i didn't quite have the tools to do it myself. i get so many compliments on my watch and i personally love looking at it!
97968	i just received this watch today, it came even faster than i expected. ladies: this is a beautiful watch, i was so nervous to choose a white watch. because most look real cheap. not this one, the crystals around the face are so pretty, and anne klein is a good brand i love it, you won't be disappointed at all, highly recommend,,,:-)
98011	boots are warm per my wife she has not worn in snow yet but likes the fit and warmth.can't rate higher because of this.updating this previuos review because my wofe has worn these boots several times now in snow and claims they are terrific. she is very glad to have these boots.
98080	i purchsed thesse socks for my child with spd, she is very sensitive about her socks and the jeffferies athletic seamless socks were a lifesaver and something she wears alost exclusively.  thought these would be a slightly more dressy option for us and ordered quite a few of them.when they arrived, although they have no seam persay across the toe, there are &#34;bumps&#34; in the corners and even the dreaded &#34;strings&#34; at the ends of where the seams would be. i had to get sissors and painstakingly cut each string off, and we still need to inside out them b/c there is that residual &#34;bump&#34; even with the strings removed. (&#34;sensory&#34; parents know what i mean lol!) it is a lot of workring to get these into a &#34;tolerable&#34; range for her to wear, and my point in buying seamless socks is to avoid yet another clothing hassle.jefferies athletic seamless are wonderful, but these were not nearly as good. nice quality sock, but don't call it seamless!
98141	this shirt... i don't even know what to say. first of all, it's a well made, well fitting shirt. the colors are vibrant, the print quality is very thick and excellent, and it fits my manly body well. then there is the subject matter. a unicorn? why would i wear that, you ask? because it's a freakin' unicorn, that's why. if you're unaware of its power, that is your own fault. let's just say that this shirt will get you noticed, anywhere you go. in fact, i expect women to flock to this review by sheer association.
98144	but keep in mind if you are at the tender age of 18 and have the body of a 12 year old boy you might want to find a child's size. because this is obviously a mans t-shirt. i was stupidly unaware. don't make such a dumb butt mistake. we all know girls want a skin tight shirt, and the medium in this just wont do.  but it is quit majestic.warning: your history teacher will make fun of you out of jealousy.
98161	amply cut, well made construction and beautiful tie dye.  i think the peace sign is printed on(colors do not go through to the other side of the fabric), but the rest of the shirt appears to be authentic tie dye technique.  doesn't matter really, as it is beautiful!
98249	i dont like the quality or the wat these fit my son.  hw wears size boys 12 shoes yet these are big and he has to break the top cause they fit him up under his knees.  not pleased with these at all.
98307	regardless of what setting you practice massage therapy in there is a good chance you're either required or prefer to wear scrubs, these are by far the best pants for our industry. durable to withstand a ton of wash cycles, seemingly shrink resistant (i always wash my scrubs on sanitize mode, plus steam cycle, and dry on medium heat and they have yet to shrink), and extremely comfortable from the very first wear. they have a good amount of flexibility in the material which allows for proper body mechanics without the constrictive discomfort of other scrub bottoms. love these, and am just about to buy a second pair.
98320	i love this top, i wear it to work every opportunity i get. there was a problem with the construction, i had to alter it a bit but its fine now. in the hope that all these tops weren't constructed with the problem i had, i do recommend it.
98356	very very comfortable shoe.  i walk on concrete all day.  the only thing i noticed is that this pair of nb run a little smaller in the toe.  i have always worn size 8 with plenty of room in any nb shoe, but these are slightly smaller.  could just be in this pair, but still great shoe with lots of grip.
98504	i love sauconys and have worn them exclusively for years now. for some reason, i have found this pair of size 9.5 much smaller than other size 9.5 saucony's i've worn in the past. i wish i had ordered the size 10 or even 10.5. not sure if it applies to all shoes of this type or that i just got a small 9.5. but after reading other reviews, it seems these shoes run a little small, at least for sizes 9-10.
98529	the color, fit, and quality are very nice.  i washed it and it came out beautifully.  very happy with this robe.
98549	"i wanted a shirt to wear around the house that was comfortable. this did fit the bill. i do have to say that i do not like the soffe logo on the arm, it is alittle annoying. i also ordered the black and it was more like charcol. i am 135 and 5""4 so i did get the large. the length of the shirt is nice but it does seem to hug the tummy just a little. i am about to order the gray as i do like it for a lounge shirt."
98581	talk about a contraption - i would need an extra half hour in the morning just to get it to fit properly!  beware brassieres with latches!  returned it.
98610	i love this bra! i am a 34b and the small fits perfectly.  i had initially ordered a medium but returned it as the band under the bust was too loose.  the bra is the most comfortable sports bra i have worn, and i do own other champion bras.  the band is padded and feels plush.  so do the straps.  they are angled perfectly and are a little padded.  they do not cut into my shoulder as i run.  my shoulders therefore feel free as i run.  the bra gives great support and i feel no bounce in my boobs at all, neither does it feel too tight.  it has a great clasp at the back which allows for easy put on and take off. it holds moisture well too and does not feel 'heavy' as i finish my run.  i actually do not feel the bra on.  in all i would highly recommend this bra.  i am going to stock up with more colours.
98613	the material is great and they do hold everything down except it hooks in the back and the only way to get it hooked is either by someone else doing it for you or if you have super long arms
98665	i loved them on my wife and she wanted me to try them on...well, her size fit me perfectly!  i love to wear these panties; so silky, soft and light!  the lace is so sexy!  my wife loves to play with the boys when i wear these sexy panties!we had to get a few of several of the colors!
98711	"i like these sterling silver earrings (bought as a gift for my wife) and they shipped very quickly.  the only thing i dislike is they are concaved on the back side (meaning, they are actually ""one-sided"" earrings).  oh well, they don't spin around so they should be good!"
98757	very pretty shirt. hard to see that the fabric has a glossy sheen to it when worn. fabric breathes well, is comfy to wear working out but due to my bad choice in sizing i do not leave the house in it. if you really have a great athletic body then this will be a great shirt to show off your tight figure without showing too much skin.  if you don't already have the perfect athletic body you might want to think about getting a size up. i  got the xxl even though i most often take an xl but in this case the shirt that is meant to be form fitted is a wee bit tight and does not flatter any less than perfect figure flaws, rather it highlights the extra tire. the cut of the shirt will still give the form fitting look but might give you some leverage in the not so pretty areas. i am five foot nine and despite the fact that it is snug the length on me is pretty true to the picture shown. keeping on the treadmill instead of returning it and in a few more pounds it will probably be a wardrobe favorite.
98838	i purchased these for my wife for christmas and though i haven't given these to her yet i have purchased some for her before. these are good warm socks. they aren't as warm as other pairs that i purchased for her, but they are close and a lot cheaper.
98881	the pockets are deep, but still easy to get into, so they are very handy. it is attractive, but casual, it would be good for the gym or the beach. it holds a lot and it is fairly wide.
98911	great pants that fit nicely and made with quality fabric.  very comfortable, stitched together well, no ironing needed, and holds its crease nicely after washing.  i posted a couple of pics of the tags it came with and a close-up of the fabric.  very satisfied with this purchase.
98984	this is a nice quality shirt with a good hand, and a great cut- it is designed for a mans body, and falls well below my hips-i'm 6' tall and the small is a little large on me- but comfy- the xs is perfect!-product review update: i just purchased 3 more of these shirts in xs- love the fit! the colors really pop- i got blue, purple, and white.
99021	i'd love to find more shirts with similar designs. unfortunately, most mountain shirts are 180 degrees away from this sort of design. the shirt quality itself is quite good.
99038	i bought these socks for our trip to india because they were supposed to be great travel socks and quick and easy to wash and dry.  my husband complained the whole time he wore them.  his feet always felt hot and sweaty, even in the morning before the heat was intense.  we both agree that cotton beats synthetic every time.
99064	"i found one similar to this one with an underwire in a discount store, it fit great. i was so happy to find this one assuming it would be just like the underwire one. on the other hand, this cami is for a b cup. i have a d cup assuming that it will stretch to my cup size. not, i had breast hanging on the side very unattractive. i would highly reccommend this cami for all b cups or smaller looking for a little tummy control. i'll give it a few  stars compared to most ""control"" cami i tried, this one does not roll up or have to worry about uncomfortable wires."
99126	i have another vanity fair bra that i really like, but not this one. not sure if it's the sizing or design, but it just doesn't fit right. the cups are slightly padded with scratchy outer fabric, which i didn't want at all. would not buy this again.
99172	"first off don't believe the word ""glitter"" in the description. there is no glitter.i also previously bought a dozen masks from another store so i had those to use as a comparison.these particular masks are much poorer quality.the band which goes around your head uses a much smaller diameter string and looks like it may break without much effort.the description says 6 1/2 inch size  - the ones i received are 5 3/4 inches.they are definitely shipping an inferior product.i would not recommend these masks."
99176	worked great for a halloween costume as the hamburglar.  would not buy for work or formal dress occasions though as not the best quality and very shiny.
99197	before purchasing this ring i read all the positive reviews and just received my ring today..lst i was not ooing and ahing when i first saw it,but when i put it on my finger and was very light and pretty..i love the emerald shde. the stone as mentioned is very light but you can see the green shade..i have thin fingers nd thought this was going to be  a very big stone so i ordered a 7 for my pointer or middle finger...well i did not like it on there..wished i had ordered a size 5 for my ring finger..then i went to my jewelry box and put  a thin faux diamond band behind the ring and one in front of the ring (they were size 5's) well to my delight this held my ring in place on my size 5 finger and it looks dynamite!!!!!! wow...i am happy as i was going to return this ring for smaller size...very happy customer..have the ring on now..not taking off..haha
99210	this is a costume-quality top hat with a velvety coating.  it's a short top hat, not a stovepipe hat so if that's what you want, you'll need to search for that style.  this worked just fine for my purposes, as part of a costume for burning man, and that says a lot.  it held up in 100-plus daytime temps, roaring alkaline dust storms, and still cleaned up quickly and easily with a little soap and water when i got home.  it essentially looks good as new and it'll probably spend another summer at burning man in the dusty playa.  not bad for an inexpensive little hat.be warned, though...i tend to have a smaller head and it fits me just fine (i'm a female) so if you have an unusually large head or if you're a larger guy, this might be snug.
99238	i ordered this shoe twice from amazon and sent it back: twice.  the first pair had two different sized shoes.  the second pair (the same size shoe order as the first pair) was smaller than the first pair. as other reviews have noted - they run small. the second pair also had a hard spot where the side of the shoe joined the sole and that alone was reason enough to send it back.  the insert is a cheap foam that is wrinkled and does not fit well. they claim these are ortholiite inserts, but look nothing like the soles that are sold on amazon's website by the same name.  the &#34;rocker bottom&#34; design is a cheap knock off of the mbt and does not give you the same feel at all.  the picture fails to show how the &#34;rocker bottom&#34; effect is achieved and in reality the shoe feels pretty flat as you walk in it.  a real disappointment and i would not recommend it for anyone.
99254	after 7 foot surgeries these feet are particularly ruthless when it comes to a quality, comfortable fit.  you name the brand (and there are many), and i've tried it.  after trying on my first pair of avia el moro i couldn't believe that my feet weren't &#34;talking&#34;!  i didn't have to break them in, try them out, or sift through my sock drawer.  they were so reasonably priced i almost didn't order equating such a great price wouldn't provide &#34;quality&#34;.  there is plenty of room for difficult toes and enough padding to feel like i was walking on air.  if your feet talk to you, try these top notch comfortable walking shoes!
99375	looks good. well made in the usa. works great. i ordered another in tan. my pants are  a 36. large belt fit fine.
99420	"these are true to size and width, and i do feel my feet are ""cradled"" in pure comfort... worth every penny! i can wear them the entire work day in my management position, and i can wear them on the go day or night. they look great dressed up or w/jeans. i have them in red, and would buy them in other colors in the future."
99441	this shirt in size small fits me well (50+ male, 5' 7&#34;, 150 lb).  it is very comfortable with &#34;fitted&#34; cut (as opposed to the &#34;compression&#34; cut which i do not care for, too tight and binding).  i wear it as a shirt or as a base-layer on a cold day.  the under armour logos on this model are relatively discrete & innocuous - which i can't say for many under armour products - and i have no interest in being a walking advertisement for the brand.  i liked the shirt so well i purchased a second
99469	i love this ring, perfect width. it needs a good cleaning. for the price, go ahead!!! why wouldn't you?!?! it's an amazing piece and i wear it everyday.
99495	i love my pants! they fit great and there long which i love, the color is the same as in the picture
99507	colors true to picture and fit well. they fit a little big at first but after a few washes fit me better. very soft and comfortable material. love that they have inside, inside pockets. (they velcro shut.) places for all your gear.
99514	the slip could have been amazing, it's soft and it did what it advertised, slims the figures, no lines. but i am giving it a single star due to erroneous sizing. i ordered the b cup and it's a full c cup! bali, please check your measuring tape. and please make one that fits b's, it's a great slip.
99593	"what does one do when the acorn slippers one found five years ago on sale finally give up the ghost?  one hunts around on the internet for replacements, that's what!  of course, the style one loves has been discontinued...that's like death and taxes: a given.  so one hustles on over to amazon.com, that source of all human balm, and bingo!  they have a nifty little booty called the ""digby"", quite close indeed to the defunct style currently hiding in the corner of the closet.  warm, snuggly and with a surprising amount of support for the tired toes, this felted wool slipper just hugs those tootsies in need of comfort and warmth.  winter's coming, dear!  why are you waiting?  order these (in two colors, like i did!) and you'll be ready for any part of winter, except maybe that vastly over-rated vacation in florida...(hint...they run a bit small...order up a tad.but, don't expect them to last!!! here it is, the first week of january, and i've worn one pair of these slippers for about 3 months.  they are falling apart!!!  the slipper has stretched out of shape and the top is splitting away from the sole.  do yourself a favor and buy some other brand.  the typical acorn quality just isn't here, folks!"
99604	these are pretty but.....they were tight on the foot and snug on leg even though i weigh 100 lbs.  they are definitely too tall for shorter girls.  they are beautiful and well made, unfortunately i had to return them.  i think for the price, they are worth the try.  they may work for lots of you.  i wish i could have kept them.
99709	light and minimalist. great material. can barely tell u r wearing anything....until everyone starts staring at your giant schlong. i bought these to help tan my legs while im running shirtless. the only reason it is not 5 stars is because the material is so thin when i run everyone can see my 12 inch penis flopping around. the shorts like my penis are a gift and a curse.
99739	men have genitals! lovely, protruding, flop-around genitals! these are terrific reality shorts. ridiculously modest prudes should avoid them or not write ridiculous reviews just because their gender was apparent in these. it's about time men celebrated their bodies. i love these shorts! perfect, comfortable, and true to size.
99769	i love the feel and look of this shirt.  i bought a few in different colors for my husband and he looks great in them.  i even wear one sometimes and they look great on me too, and so comfy to sleep in also.  i have had them about a month and the hem is coming out on one, but that is easy to fix.  for the price you can't beat the look and comfort of these shirts.  i will continue to buy more of them.  the colors are great looking also.
99863	very nice quality, great work shirt. typical button down fit, and great after washing, holds shape and fabric stays smooth.
99879	i love, love, love these panties.  i especially like the seam up the back which gives a very natural look to your backside underneath pants.  i also like the stretch cotton.  i ordered my regular size 8 which i have worn for years buying size 8vanity fair women's perfectly yours ravissant tailored nylon brief panty #15712.  this is my second pair of bali and a different style, the first beingbali women's lacy skamp hikini panty #2433,, also with the back seam.  i highly recommend this panty and plan to buy more.
99911	this is a nice sturdy bag with good handles and a beefy zipper, and so pretty too. it carries easily over the shoulder.  i spilled water in it today, and it wiped right out easily. i don't use it for groceries but to haul around other stuff.  a little pricier than the study plastic bags from the grocery store, but they don't have zippers.  i like to buy american, and the materials for the bag come from another country, but blue q does donate to the nature conservancy, so that's a good thing.dec. 2012--i've used it to carry around books, and it's holding up ok.  those black straps go around the bottom of the bag for good support.
99940	i ordered these like others for only $44. i also ordered a pair of uggs for much more around the same time, and they arrived the same day. there was not even a difference. the emus were much more comfy than the uggs, hands down. i have worn them for 2 days now in below 0 weather (-12 and -17 respectfully) and my feet stayed nice and toasty warm. they were worn through a small amount of snow, with no leaking. i also wore them in icy conditions and no problems with slipping at all. what i love the most is that it is like wearing slippers all day long! the alba is super plush, and they ran very true to size for me (do not order a size smaller). i would pay the over $100 for these boots in a heart beat over the uggs . . . which were given to my sister. like someone else said, they are like walking on a cloud. please amazon bring back the gold box pricing on these!!!!
100001	i bought these to wear as work shoes, i'm on my feet all day. i love these! they are super comfortable and run true to size, they are also stylish. i may have to buy another pair!
100006	so comfortable and light weight. they look cute with pants or shorts, love to wear all day! i have planters fasciitis and these are so comfortable!
100049	"i would have given this bra ""5 stars"" if only it had a 3- or 4-hook system instead of just two.  because it has only two hooks, the dreaded ""back fat"" is not as camoflaged as it could be. otherwise, it is perfect, soft, stretchy, comfy, and makes you have a really nice shape from the front.  the fabric can't be beat.  the straps are also comfortable.  i hope they eventually change this particular style to at least 3-hook."
100114	fivefingers bikila shoes are fantastic.when i go out sailing these are the kind of shoes you want. feels like you are barefoot yet the grip of the soles is powerful (typical of vibram quality).when i go for a swim in the lake fivefingers are a must. i can swim freely but still i don't hurt the soles of my feet on the bottom of the lake.i like this style better because sand doesn't get inside whereas the mary jane style does.also the back of the shoe is raised and that means no blisters even without socks.when i'm back home i just throw them in the washer and dryer and they are good to go again!
100143	wonderful cleaner. i use it daily for my glasses. it makes my good jewelry sparkle, and my cheap jewelry look nice.i put just half a capful of the jewelry cleaner in the water. it doesn't 't take much soap to do an excellent job. i am too nervous to use dish soap in it as others have recommended. it might work great, but i don't plan to use it.
100213	i am rating these low based on this being my 3rd pair. i originally ordered the classic but the straps that held your foot in was defective on one of the shoes.  after returning i decided to research and found these which had an adjustable strap so that i wouldn't have anymore problems at a drastic price increase.  i thought i was buying peace of mind for the price but i was wrong.  the pair of yukon sports i initially received were horrible in quality.  there was glue all over the inside, thread that was not complete and they were deformed all this for a retail of $55. one shoe was squish in while the other was flattened (rubbed horribly on top of my foot.) i thought the deformation might have been caused from shipping as they came in a bag so i tried to give them  a day and tried to reform them but no luck these were messed up from the factory.  so i sent them back for my 3rd pair which are perfect and fit and feel great. they are not as comfortable as the originals but are more stylish. i am finally satisfied but the quality control is ridiculous especially for the cost. between my returns  i learned  that these are now being made in mexico and not china and are now are having quality issues. so good luck; glad i have amazon as they are the best in customer service and have made this nightmare manageable.
100244	this boyshort provides some coverage with the feel of light to moderate control without being too high and long or skimpy. the quality is excellent for washing and wear and can go well with dresses, skirts or pants. always comfortable, they are true to size and modestly priced. a great deal all around. if they work for you, you might want to get a few for a collection, as it would make sense to stock up on such a great nice price product.
100248	this is a good product. they fit well and the material is comfortable. i don't like the seam in the front though.
100283	runs small - normally wear a 36 c and i definitely need a 36 d!!!!!!  i read some reviews that also says that for some reason the online sizing is different than in the store!  and this is the case!  sending back!
100288	"i originally ordered this bra because i want something that i can wear this summer or while doing housework and not feel like i'm sweaty and gross in that area and i want something with very little but some padding. i expect to be having baby number 2 in the fall/winter of this year. i want a bra that is comfy especially this summer as i will be ""growing"". at first i was going to send this one back. i hated the thickness. it seems a little thicker than i thought, but it really isn't that bad at all. i ended up loving this bra! it's very comfortable...probably the most comfortable of this kind i've bought. i can barely tell i am wearing a underwire bra with it."
100290	i loved this bra at first.  it is really soft and gives me a little bit of lift without feeling like a stripper (i tried on tons of maidenform push up bras that made me feel that way - way too much padding it was ridiculous).  i thought it was a little odd that you adjust the straps in the front instead of in the back, but i figured i'd get used to having those little bumps in the front or on top of my shoulders after awhile.  i didn't really get used to it, it still bugs me.  this bra was pretty good at first, other than that, but over time (a few months) it has stretched out so much that it hardly fits me anymore.  i wish i could say that i lost weight and that is the reason, but i haven't.  even using the tightest hooks, i can take this bra off easily without unhooking it.  i'm a 36 b, and now it feels like i'm wearing a 38-40 b.  that and the straps fall down all the time.  i wear this bra every day, and i share an office in the same room with 8 other people so it's really annoying and embarrassing to have to adjust my bra straps at work every few hours.  sorry maidenform, i'm going back to barely there bras.
100319	this is the second bra i bought online and i love it! it's comfotable and sexy. the straps only come undone when i wash the bra but they easily reattach with no problem. i'm buying more bras from this company.
100359	i absolutely loved this bag.  i could wear it as a backpack when i was rolling my larger luggage.  then after checking the large bag, i could switch to the rolling feature very easily.  it rolled very smoothly and was very easy to manage.  also fit under the seat in most of the planes i was on.  there was one plane that the underseat area was too small and i had to put it in the overhead bin.  the bag seems to be constructed  with sturdy material and it is roomy enough to carry all the items i had planned to take on board.  i really can't think of any negatives related to my expectations for the use of the bag.
100367	after two back operations and all the tech equipment i like to carry with me, i was looking for a rolling backpack for the airplane. this one is perfect for me. it has lots of space, but fits under the seat for southwest airlines. it has three areas for storage and holds all the stuff i don't want to risk losing in my luggage. i don't really use this as a backpack, guess i could, but with a bad back - why would i? i really can't think of any improvements.
100391	i saw this visor in macy's and i tried it on and decided to order it online. i not only saved myself money, but acquired a nice looking visor that has great coverage because it is wider and gives more protection to my face. i recommend this product for ladies who are looking to protect  the whole face. this is a very pretty visor. it is both feminine and stylish!!!!
100481	small is medium and medium is large. i can wear it as pajamas.i wish they used non-vanity sizes. otherwise ok.
100501	nice, and warm enough, the size was perfect although the reviws said the sleeves run long, i don't tink so !!!
100533	i really love this undergarment to protect me from the winter cold.  i got so much less tolerant to winter and this never interferes with my ability to wear any snug clothing on top.  it is thin enough and yet so incredibly soft!  i love my new winter helper!
100550	i'm 5'6 and about a size 12 and these fit me great in size l. they definitely got me through a very cold nyc trip during the holiday season. i wore them under jeans and i never felt sweaty or clammy when indoors (even on the bus ride to ny!). i would definitely recommend them.
100558	my daughter is pretty picky with her things and i was very careful about picking this one for her because of that.  her sweat pants for school fit her terribly and she refuses to wear it because she was swimming in it, so she's been wearing her shorts.  it is winter now and she has pe for first period.  it's about 30 degrees in the morning and she still wears her shorts for pe.  i felt bad for her so that's why i bought her these.  i made sure it's exactly the same color as the ones kids use at her school.  she slept in it this weekend and she said, &#34;i think i will wear the sweats to school for pe tomorrow.  they're comfy&#34;  gotta love that from a picky girl =-)  happy daughter makes a happy mom!
100588	"skechers shape-ups had me at my first pair (black hydro xw--for extended wear, not extra-wide like i thought...). with knee and lower back issues and bunions (on a size 5.5 foot), it's very difficult to find comfortable shoes that don't bind and pinch. skechers shape-ups did it for me! the day the hydros were delivered, i put them on, went into the city and walked... for hours. no lower back pain, no knee pain, and no foot fatigue, pain, pressure, or pinching! criss-cross z-straps with velcro closure (albeit, you have to be into velcro). they do give the glutes and hamstrings a workout too--secondary benefits to having a comfortable shoe i can stand or walk in for extended time.completely motivated, i purchased 2 more pair (x-wear hyper blast mary janes, in pewter/gray and toffee/brown.) ahhhhh! more heavenly comfort! i am quickly and resolutely a shape-ups fanatic. the hyper blast mary janes offer the same decadent comfort as the hydro, as well as the same toning benefit. still no lower back or knee pain, and no foot pinching, binding, pain, or fatigue. just a little more buttock/hamstring muscle burn. (i work out occasionally, but not avidly. not sure if the shape-ups will make a difference to a marathon runner.)the first time in years that i'm not compelled to kick off my shoes the first chance i get. i pretty much live in them now. as other fans have reviewed, i don't want to take them off at night!they may not be haute couture strappy shoes, but if comfort is a priority over fashion, then these mary janes will work with both jeans and skirts. note: the ""pewter"" color is truly medium silver metallic leather w/gray suede. (many internet pix show the pewter style as platinum--it isn't, it's gray.) thanks, skechers--you've given me my active lifestyle back! can't imagine buying or walking in anything else! and thanks, amazon, for the great price and availability!"
100619	this fits so well. i am 5'9, 32c/34b, and 130 pounds and it accentuates my curves perfectly. it is tight in all the right places. i am a skinny girl and my boobs aren't that big so i have to find lingerie that fits well enough to accentuates or at least lift my small breasts... this fits nicely. i am very happy with this purchase. the material is nice i love the lace halter at the top where your boobs go. it feels so soft. this is my second purchase from seven til midnight and i am very impressed with this brand.
100623	the case has a nice texture on the outside.  it snaps firmly shut and there is plenty of room for my glasses without them sliding around.  it's just what i was looking for and at a price better than i expected.
100628	i buy my glasses online and the cases they come with aren't that good so i get these. they work really well and i haven't had one wear out yet. great product.
100648	is large enough to wear on head, waist, around the face, ect. very lovely and nice colours and nice beads. highly highly recommend. good quality.
100669	i love asics but made the mistake of purchasing these a 1/2 size smaller because they were a great price.  my bad.  learn from your mistakes, because i believe these shoes help keep me going.
100720	-1- i expected products like this to be some type of light oil thus the $12.00 price.-2- upon opening the bottle got a very strong wiff of alcohol this told me that i wasted $12.00-3- i'm sure brovofun would say this stuff is a secret blend handed down over hundreds of years.-4- i really don't buy into / now i know why the ad did not list the ingredients.-5- i went on-line did some digging around.-6- make your own stuff 1 part alcohol and 3 parts water & do it all for around $1.50 + bottle.-7- the product for $12.00 did work but i think one can do better..............
100779	i wouldn't recommend this if you have a bunch of rings to display but rather if you have a choice few that are your best and brightest.  this display is good for that - highlighting your best ring work.  the velvet is great and the overall build of the display is just fine.  i have no complaints!
100828	you'll have to buy a thicker rain jacket with more insulation for the winter months, but this is a good option to have during the summer. although it does get stuffy sometimes wearing this jacket in &#34;the deep south&#34;, the material is thin allowing more breathability than other heavy duty rain jackets. another great thing about it being so thin is that it can be rolled up and placed into a backpack without taking up too much space. no complaints and happy with this purchase.
100980	this charm is really cute!  i bought it as a gift for a friend and she also really liked it.  great quality and exactly as described.
100989	purchased for the man of the house and he doesn't like the clips. while they're advertised to grip strong when more pressure is applied, he has to reclip these too many times throughout the day.
100993	its a decent bag, nothing special, and a fair size. i was worried by some of the reviews that it might be too big for my needs..something to hang from wheelchair to carry oxygen and recharger..however it handles either one of them..just which is fine.
101073	people give negative reviews on an item like this because they do not know how to use or wear winter clothing.with socks it is very simple, a sock like this one will be fine in sub-zero weather if used correctly.you boot, shoe or whatever you wearing must be big enough to accommodate this or any heavy sock.  if your boot or shoe is too tight or even just tight, your feet will be cold no matter what material the sock is made of.air must circulate in your boot or shoe in order for your feet stay warm.  the natural warmth given off by your foot will circulate inside the boot or shoe.  if your foot is constricted by boots or shoes that are too small to accommodate heavy or multiple socks your feet will be cold.if wearing heavy thick socks or multiple socks always buy boots at least a half size larger than you would normally wear.  sometimes you have to go a full size bigger depending on the boot or shoe.for even better results when wearing winter socks like this one, you should wear a sock liner under your winter socks.  these are specially made to wear under heavy socks and are very thin and usually made of a polyester material to wick away any sweat from your feet.most important though, is to have the right size boot or shoe, never wear boots or shoes too small to accommadate heavy winter socks.  it's not the sock, it's the way you are using them.
101081	i work in the oil field, and we work in the roughest conditions. with temps as low as -20, these were a life saver! a must buy if you work in cold temps.
101100	i love mk and the fact that amazon has mk is a plus. the purse is a bit small for my taste but that's my fault for not paying attention. but i still love it. cute. simple. and elegant. color is right on.
101131	it seems small and cut more like a jr shirt than woman's. size up and it might be ok. i will wear it to bed.
101137	i get complements on this bag every day! it is roomy but not too big and goes with lots of different colors and styles. i love this purse!!
101187	very cute but runs a whole size small. i usually wear an 8 1/2. i ordered a 9 and it fits very snugg with no extra space to spear. wish i ordered a  whole size larger.it was defeating the purpose trying to wear tight slippers so i returned them. you will love this shoe if you order a whole size larger.
101219	this item arrived very quickly. i like the style and fit of this ring. i use it as a stackable item. it looks great. i do housework with the ring on. it does not tarnish the color or shine of the ring. i am wearing it proudly and getting compliments. thanks amazon.
101231	i'm usually in the 16-18 area depending on the brand and after having trying a few different similar products on in store i thought i'd need an xx-large (purchased online for a better price). this one more smooths me lightly than taking things in. the compression is fairly light so i'd go with a xl if you're closing in on the 16 range for better compression.the material is light and breathable, which i like and it also stays put around my hips. it certainly helps your shoulder posture but has a tenancy to slip off, so i wouldn't wear sleeveless with this.
101233	i purchased this hoping it would be a better option than the panty style slimmers, which constantly roll down and i was not disappointed!  this slimmer is made of a soft, comfortable fabric that isn't too hot and wears well under clothes.  it slims from the hips all the way up the back and bra line, doesn't ride-up or roll on the bottom, and is very comfortable for all day wear.  the slimming effect is moderate - not a firm control briefer in my opinion, but slims, smooths, and firms nicely without being restrictive.  every bit as good as the more expensive versions.  i'm ordering a few more!
101311	***update***i've had the bag for over a year now... still epic!  strong as an ox.  holds everything.. washes well.. nothing short of amazing and well worth the price!  i took it on a 3 week trip to japan and it stood up to daily urban exploring... 100% best backpack ever in the history of the world.-----------------i have had this bag for a few weeks and use it daily for bike rides.  the bag is massive and durable.  one problem came about.  the waterproof bag lining the backpack has welded seams however one of them was defective and had begun to split.  splitting would eventually lead to a useless waterproof sheet versus a functional bag.  i found the banjo brother site and emailed the contact.  he replied within 10 minutes and i got a new liner in two days.the bag is amazing!  you can fit a 24 pack of cans be it soda or beer or whatever.the inner lining rolls up with the top of the backpack and the bag itself has drain holes on the bottom so if you get caught in a downpour the stuff in your waterproof liner will be dry as a bone.great price for a fantastic bag.
101338	"i, like other reviewers, tried my regular size and realized that o'neill clothing runs a size small. i am 5'4""/118 lbs and am small chested, and i originally ordered a small - whoa!! - way to tight; had to send it back. the medium fit very well in that i had room to move my arms and didn't feel like i was choking. i was able to use it as a skin inside a wetsuit, as well as alone as a sun protectant for snorkeling and swimming. it worked like a charm for both. i ordered the blue and the pink color in the long sleeved version, and the black in the short sleeved version. i wore them all and loved each one. afterward, i washed them in the washing machine (on the delicate cycle with regular detergent), popped them into the dryer for a few minutes and then hung them to dry. they washed beautifully without shrinking, stretching or fading. they also pack well; i literally folded and rolled these up as tiny as i could in my suitcase, and they looked great when i arrived at my destination. my only wish is that o'neill would stop using little tiny elves as their size models. other than that, this shirt is a great purchase."
101342	i'm a size 12/14 and i got the xl - i know wetsuits/rash guards tend to run small and i didn't want to have it super duper tight. it fits perfectly and looks great. i wore it in the sun and it completely protected my skin. these can be extremely expensive, but amazon's price was a great value.
101424	this sack pack is really good and worth it. color combination is really good. the quality of the bag, the zipper, the side pockets are pretty good.
101534	i expected this o be a little smaller..however, it feels nice and its a very good price..i like the color, the material, its just tooo big..
101569	i was returning from a long trip with many connections and delays during which i was logging a very full and heavy carryon without wheels. i swear the shoulder strap left marks. a woman next to me in the airport lounge had this compact, stylish, wheeled carryon - i asked her what brand and she said travelon. i bought it online then and there. i was so thrilled when it arrived - it's everything i hoped it would be, with a compact profile that i know will fit under the seat in front of me, lots of interior, wipe-able pockets and made well. i can't wait to use it. my shoulder will thank me!
101577	to be honest the brand xoxo not know her, try to model since she likes to watch my wife, to get as detailed and very cute presentation tried it and liked ..you have to give more time to see the quality of machine to see how it works, but the first impression was very good.
101596	watch broke the first week, you get what you pay for thats for sure, recommend another watch but the xxoo brand is good jyst not this one.
101625	sorry no where i get my wachs ... and i will be waiting ... what happens??? happens?? need answers?sorry no where i get my wachs
101629	i adore this charm bracelet watch! it is made well so you can wear it everyday. the only thing is one of the charms fell off after two months of daily wear. however, you can add charms to the bracelet and it looks so good when layered. i would buy this again because you cannot beat the price!
101649	elegant watch for my husbandhe loves itis a beautiful gift, the color is nice and is heavy just love it
101810	they are good knockoffs for uggs.  it's good to get an custom insole with them, as they are not very supportive on your feet.  however, that is expected with the price.  with an insole, they are quite comfortable and very cute.
101866	these boots are fashionable and comfortable.  if size 4 kids' bearpaws are too small for you, you'll want to get size 7 women's.
101909	i got these for myself and kids for christmas. we recently had a pretty decent snowfall where the cold and snow lasted for several days. when i wear my bearpaws and go outside in the freezing cold, i can't feel the cold at all on my feet! my kids were very excited to get the bearpaw brand shoes. the size is actual and my boots fit snug and comfortable.remember to spray with a water resistant spray so they don't get stained and ruined.love these boots, they are perfect for winter wear!
101966	love these boots!!!  they are so comfortable and warm.  lots of fur inside and may seem a bit snug the first couple of times you wear them but fit perfectly fine after the first few times of wearing them.  size is very accurate.  will buy more as needed and will recommend to everyone.
101970	i bought a pair of bearpaws for myself last year and bought this pair for my 10 year old.  they are made extremely well, true to size and my daughter loves them as they keep her feet toasty warm.  plus, at this price, why would i ever consider buying a pair of uggs?
101983	i wear a 7 in real uggs and i bought a 7 in these and they were small.  but they are made well and worth the $. i buy a pair for my 6 yr. old every year and she wears them all winter.
102091	i was not expecting that the pendant is small.  i thought it would be big enough to be as noticeable as possible.  i also thought that it would suit my age but it turned out that it's cute and a nice gift for kids or teens.  i think that the size of a necklace or pendant should be best described in a picture with a model wearing the item.  this way, you can estimate its true size rather than just describing it by measurement. some do have pictures, but others don't have.
102105	"this past summer was a horrible summer for any sunglasses i touched. i went through about a dozen cheap pairs that i picked up from local brick and mortar stores. sitting here i realize that, if i were to add up the cost of all these cheap sunglasses, i could of bought a couple of very nice pairs. i have only owned cheap sunglasses and i wondered if paying a premium on sunglasses is worth it.enter the oakley mens crosshair sunglassesi picked these up because they came to my attention being apart of a sale. i was hesitant due to even the sale price but, as i mentioned beforehand, just a few cheap pairs would cover the cost of these glasses.they arrived in the mail and come pre-packaged in a simple cardboard box. within the cardboard box the glasses are protected in a soft cloth bag and also contain a cleaning rag and small info brochure.i immediately pulled out the glasses and spent the next few hours walking around trying them on and, have to say, i am pretty impressed.many of my cheap glasses broke due to poor construction of the frames. these frames feel durable and like they will last. i have a large head that does put tension on glasses. these glasses were able to take the tension yet retain their original shape.the glasses are not polarized but do a good job on their own protecting my vision from the suns glare. the lenses are the perfect tint and did not block out my vision of the outside world.i received compliments from my wife and neighbors about how stylish the glasses look. it reminds me of the hoopla during the 80's when tom cruise sported ""aviator"" glasses from the movie top gun and the craze he created.pro:++ durable construction++ compliments on how stylish they lookcon:++ for price, only receiving a cloth bag for protection is cheapconclusion:these glasses are well worth the premium paid over regular sunglasses you find sitting on a carousel rack at the local brick and mortar stores. just watch for the sales when they go on to pick up then."
102127	gave these as a gift. she said that they fit true to size and were super warm and comfortable. definitely recommended
102143	while not the best quality slipper with a sheepskin lining, it is more than adequate for the price. very warm, and easy to slipinto. the fleece on the footbed is on the thin side, but i did not expect ugg quality with this slipper, at this price. there arecomplaints of the sheepskin becoming flat and thin, but for this price it is still a well made slipper. in my opinion, it will lasta season or two.  it runs true to size, and if my feet are a little cold, i wear them with a pair of socks. the sole is very sturdy,and suitable for trips to the mailbox, or picking up a newspaper.  all in all, i am pleased with this bearpaw slipper.
102174	"i had been looking for a wind-breaker style jacket for a while in navy and ran across this on amazon. i own other london fog coats and jackets so i knew the quality would be there without question. and, it is. being able to purchase it at a great discount on amazon (with quick delivery, i might add) was a great plus.there are four exterior pockets, one on top of the other on each side. the ""top"" pockets are zippered, which is a very nice feature, as i seem to use them a lot. no more having smaller items fall out. there are three interior pockets. two are actually pretty spacious and are top open access, one left and one right, and secured with velco. the final, lower left side, has a flap, again with velcro. and there have been times i have used all of them.the material is soft and feels good when wearing. the adjustable snap cuff is an added bonus. the jacket is well-made with good london fog attention to detail. two snaps on the sleeve to fit probably any size arm. sometimes, i even unsnap them, depends on the look i want. as of this writing, my jacket looks exactly as pictured on amazon.make no mistake. this is not for extreme winter wear. i bought it for spring and fall use, as well as the occasional crisp summer nights. it is perfect for that use. it has even kept me very dry in rain, including some pretty heavy downpours. the microfiber dries out fairly quickly. i have not had any issues with wrinkling.i am quite pleased with, and highly recommend, this jacket. so much so, that i also purchased one in black."
102184	never tried this on because as soon as i held it i knew i would not wear it. i am large-38dd- and i've owned bras that had a slight thickness so there was a smooth look with sweaters,but those other bras were thinly padded, soft and flexible. this bra was none of those things. i don't know what the padding was but it felt like a foam. it was stiff and seemed as if it would be very warm-too warm. the color and shape were as shown. it cost almost $10 to return.
102300	see my review of nb645 shoes.  i was somewhat hesitant about purchasing a non-rated shoe from amazon.  however, i took a chance thinking that this model was simalar to the nb645 model.  i haven't been disappointed.  great support, good fit and i expect to get at least 6 months of wear or better.  i generally walk between 25 and 40 miles per week.  i use a spenco polysorb cross trainer insert and this seems to be the perfect combination to keep my plantar fasciitis in check.  in fact, i've used the same insert for two pairs of shoes and still get good support.
102402	i received compliments on this one even before i put it on.  the design on the fabric is nice and is thin, which is good since i rather avoid a sweaty head.  the construction is well done beyond the price i paid for it.  i have a 23in head and size large fit perfectly.  i like this hat so much that i might be buying the other color as well.
102407	having read the reviews and complaints about the narrowish foot bed and having read reviews on a tv shopping channel who carries this brand, amazon carries womens a2 aerosoles and sell the all cork models in width c/d. check it out. and i am not an amazon employee. i just research before i buy. these finally arrived and they are just a bit narrow in the vamp part which goes across the toes- i got the regular sized width- but i can stretch it and they do fit in length as expected. they are relatively comfortable and quite cute.
102425	i liked the ide of this product but the fit was way too big i only used it a couple times and now it is just sitting in my drawer. order a size smaller than you think.
102527	estos interiores vienieron con talla 2-3t cuando se les solicito la talla 4. quede desepcionado de la compra de este articulo
102636	first off, delivered way faster than i ever would have expected! i ordered it on a friday afternoon and it was delivered on a tuesday afternoon on memorial weekend nonetheless! so, fantastic delivery time! secondly, after reading the reviews and some people saying the sizing was accurate and others saying the ring ran too small or too big, i took my chances. my fiance wears a 10 1/2 so i ordered a 10. the ring fits him but it's a little snug so a 10 1/2 would have definitely sufficed. with my experience i would say the sizing of this ring is accurate and true to size. he says it's comfortable so i'm not complaining lol and thirdly, this ring is soooooo handsome! honestly. it's so shiny and sleek and just really masculine. it definitely makes his hands look even sexier. it hasn't scratched or dulled at all either. overall this product will most definitely be rated a 5 and i would order from the seller again :-)
102637	shirt fit great. used it for church halloween party.the party was a super hero costume party, i was the only bat girl there.
102707	"*** 1/23/13: i am providing an update to my review, to say that sadly, i'm going to knock my rating down to 3 stars. i bought these jeans in september, and after only 4 months of wear, i now have 2 lovely large holes on the insides of both legs in the thigh area. hugely disappointing! i wear jeans just about every day, and this eventually happens to all of them. but it usually takes at least a year! four months is pretty pathetic. i have jeans from old navy that lasted longer! oddly enough though, i have another pair in this same style that is the very dark indigo color that i purchased maybe a month later, and those are perfectly fine (the material seems a little better quality). sad since i mostly like the style and fit!***i really love these jeans, and bought them based on the good reviews - very glad i did! my only complaint is the that the waist is too big, with the front rise being a little higher than i prefer (but these are the woes of being pear-shaped! only custom pants resolve the waist gap for me). otherwise the amount of stretch feels just right - i own many pairs of 98% cotton/2% spandex jeans that are way stretchier, but these jeans are fitted, and give just enough to move with you, but not too much that they will be a size bigger by the end of the day! i have already worn them 3 or 4 times in a row and they have not lost their shape at all! the length is also amazing - i am 5'11"" and they are even a little too long (but perfect w/a pair of 1.5""-2"" heels). overall these are definitely the most comfy jeans i own and the color is great for going out, wearing to the office, or casual hanging out. and you can't beat the price! i am only giving these jeans 4 stars because i haven't had them long enough to see how durable they are, but given that dickies makes work clothes, i expect no less from their jeans."
102877	i like when a shoe lives up to the hype and this one does. fits perfect, looks great and the color i was looking for. i do remember florsheim's having stores all over when i was a kid and wondered what happened to them. i hear the original family has the business back and it shows with the product. i'm gald i made the purchase.
102918	the 8-9 size was much too small for my daughter, who usually wears size 8.  order up, runs small.  xxx
102981	bought these elsewhere and ended up paying more :-(but i love these shoes, i wear 8 1/2 in most shoes and boots, got an 8 1/2 and they fit perfectly. comfortable out of the box, and the black ones are cuter in person than the photos online. my feet are on the wider side of medium width and i have lots of room, but my feet don't slip around. so comfy, i think these are my new go-to sneaks!
103063	my luggage set actually arrived in just one day with prime, instead of two. it didn't really matter, since my trip is still over a month away, but it is always a nice surprise when this does happen.the reviews concerned me, at first, that i was about to pay $99 for something that would just get ripped up. however, i decided to go for it since i loved the polka dots and i don't see myself getting on a plane anytime soon, or maybe ever.i was actually surprised when i opened the box that the fabric felt thicker and higher quality than the one black rolling back i have been using for years (hand-me-down from my mom). the wheels roll smoothly, the handles open/close smoothly and have a nice, satisfying click to them when you push them back in. small detail that doesn't matter... the whole handle is black, not gray or silver like in the picture. i actually prefer this.another reason i like this set over others, is that the bags have the full length pockets on the front, instead of the two smaller pockets that most have. not only does this look better, but allows for bigger/longer items (such as large envelopes) to be separate from the main bag.my zippers do not, in any way, seem cheap or plastic. i don't know if they upgraded the zipper pulls since previous reviews, but mine are metal with a thick rubber grip on them. they are quite nice and i don't see them snapping off at any point.the inside lining does zip open, if needed. however, the lining is pulled tight and, in my opinion, makes the need for extra support on the back of the bag unnecessary. i was prepared to do the cardboard adding thing, but i actually prefer the bags as they are, since they will provide more room for clothes without putting in a backing. the zipper lining feature is nice, though, as you could easily put extra cash or anything inside in case you are worried someone might go looking through your bags. i'd imagine that the nifty cardboard idea would make the zipper &#34;pocket&#34; an even better hiding place.additional features include little slide in name tags, side handles, large mesh &#34;pockets&#34; on the inner &#34;flap&#34; and a lock with two keys on each bag. the locks and keys do feel cheap (think middle school diary), but that doesn't matter to me as i never bother locking anything that can be carried away.the smell isn't as strong as i expected from other reviews, but it is there and it is not pleasant. it is no more than you would expect from any new book bag or anything though. it will air out in no time.overall, i am in love with this set, and i am so glad i bought it. this is my first luggage set, ever. i used to piece together random bags from my mom for weekend trips. however, we are about to embark on our very first week long family vacation and i figured it was about time to get grown up luggage. i highly recommend this set.. the worst that could happen is you might actually get a defective set, as happens from time to time with any product. however, amazon would help you to exchange them and they come with a 5 year warranty.happy shopping!
103129	i wore these almost every time i was out running last winter. i live in pa. the temperatures were in the ranges of 40 to warmest and around 10 degrees as coldest. with the wind blowing that is. anyways, i was out on very cold days with these pants and they were easily the warmest part of my body. for running that is great because your legs won't cramp up. it keeps your muscles loose. if only the rest of my body could have been as warm. i was the only one who went in the water at the beach this early summer because i could withstand the cold. get these, they are perfect for running in cold weather.
103134	they are really really cute. a little heavy but i see they are made with good quality. looking forward to using them with the corset ive ordered! btw they are not made to wear under pants they are a lingerie to wear by itself with a top or so. they are thick but that's good for the quality. they will last a while!
103153	it holds up well, i've used it for a few flights and is completely intact.it is just the side-material that seems like it might tear b/c of how thin it feels but other then that it is good.
103155	i bought this luggage case for my husband to carry his camera gear to weddings and such. the wheels are great for easy maneuvering . it's very well made. he loves it!
103177	nice comfortable shoulder pad with grip surface.  metal swivel buckles are rugged heavy material.  good for daily carry of my man purse - a wilderness tactical safepacker ([...]  nice.
103197	this suitcase is very lightweight and functional.  it is a perfect size in that it almost makes it impossible to exceed the weight limits on checked luggage while still giving you plenty of room.  my husband and i each took one for a 7 day trip and we had plenty of room for all our stuff and still came in under 50 lbs.  this luggage makes this possible by dispensing with a lot of structural reinforcements.  basically it is just fabric stretched over a lightweight metal box frame.  my husbands suitcase developed a slight tear the first flight.  also the extendable handle is rather flimsy.  i feel that the quality of the luggage is about what you would expect for the price you pay.  if you are looking for a lightweight, inexpensive suitcase that you will not be upset to throw away after a few uses, you will probably be satisfied.  if you are looking for something that will last for years of heavy use, you should look elsewhere and expect to pay more.
103281	great shirt, very comfortable. definitely get a size larger than normal if you want the bottom to reach the waistband of pants. also it is very form fitting and looks more flattering if size bigger. the scoop neck is perfect. not too low so can be worn to work but low enough to be very feminine and shows off a necklace very well. looks just as great with a skirt as with jeans. it didn't shrink after i washed and dried it.
103304	this dress fit nicely, and was fun to wear, i got a lot of compliments! it was very staticy and clung to my legs.
103307	"i ordered this for my son's school halloween party which i was required to dress up for as well.  having not lost baby weight from 2nd born at the time, i was hoping for something conservative and would hide the ""junk in the trunk"".  this item was perfect.  it had a nice fit and was true to the size advertised.  i would totally recommend this."
103324	i hated to return these shoes. the toe area was shaped different than my other sketchers and was cramping my feet.
103360	i buy my daughter a pair every winter and they look super adorable on.  she doesn't complain about the comfort level and they keep the tootsies nice and snuggly warm.  less than half the price of uggs, which i love because she'll grow out of them before the following year.
103374	i got these for both my grandsons. fit as expected, very nice and warm. i like these as well as uggs.
103424	so i bought a pair of the mule fitflops earlier this year and fell in love. i had been watching these boots for a while, trying to decide if i needed another pair. i finally convinced myself to try them and have not been disappointed. they are super comfy and warm. while i wasn't sure the shoes were actually giving me a workout around the house, when i wore them into campus they were definitely having an impact. they had the look i wanted, with the price i wanted, with a comfort that is unbelievable. you will not be disappointed with this purchase.
103492	my wife can never find jeans that fit or look good in stores.she has a 34&#34; inseam and is 6' tall with a little bit of a flat backside.these give a little lift in the back, and are long enough to be worn with boots.the waist rise, and overall fit are comfortable for her and she looks great.this was one of the few pairs without overly ornate back pockets.these are just pain, comfy jeans that fit well.best of all, the price is good, so she'll keep them instead of saying it was too expensive. :)
103501	i bough this g-shock two weeks ago and i've been wearing this almost everyday. the setup is not hard as some say. read the manual and you will know how to operate this watch. i thought the orange color might be too flashy but the orange is very handsome on the wrist. i love the mineral glass on this which makes the watch look very unique with the orange dial. i also bought he white version but i see myself wearing this orange version more. this watch is totally worth $200+. you will be amazed by the technology behind this watch.
103534	i take on a completely different personality when wearing this mask, so beware!  buttercup jenkins is his name, and his favorite 80's band, for obvious reasons, is hall & oats.  he has been trying to break into the stand-up comedy business, but he finds it much more difficult than breaking into the porn industry because, well, he's hung like...anyway, back to the mask.  the mask that i got for some reason doesn't look quite as 'surprised' as the pic online, but maybe the pic was taken right as someone was scaring the person with the mask on, thus the look of shock on the horse's face.  the mane isn't quite as extravagant as the picture leads you to believe, but to each their own.  you must not be claustrophopic or you may have problems with living in a confined stall, eating straw and hay while wearing this mask, but i do guarantee that you'll get laughs-a-plenty if you decide to wear this to church.stop horsing around and pick one of these up today.  and just think, you can support chinese labor because that's where it's manufactured!  another benefit of this is that it is made in china by people who probably eat horses, but are definitely not hung like them.seriously though, the mask is just what it looks like online.  it's cheap, but well made for what it is, and if you can deal with not being able to see well, or communicate well while wearing it, you will love it and the laughs it brings.  i am probably going to get similar masks with unicorns, chipmunks and i think i saw one with a fish head that struck my fancy.
103605	i got this in tri-indigo.  really pretty color- a deep blue/ purple.i got the medium because i normally wear a size medium in shirts.  this one fits great (really open and billowy throughout the body) but the sleeves are about an inch too short.  i find myself constantly pulling them down and i know that eventually i will stretch out the material enough that it rips at the wrists.  i'm not going to return it, though, because i love the color and the body fit enough to make do with the hassle of pulling down the sleeves.
103619	"great product, fit, quality. i am a male, and they do come all the way to my crotch, as i like. i am 5'10"".  they feel so sexy on, and i would highly recommend them to males or females. great crossdressing item."
103683	i highly recommend this umbrella becuase it's very sturdy and holds up in strong storms.  also because it's clear, when you're all dressed up, you can shield yourself better, because you can see where you're going.
103716	i bought this blanket for my travel on amtrak. i am so glad i brought a blanket because it was so cold on the train. it kept me warm and didn't take up too much space
103720	the blanket is of good quality, and it is soft and comfy and warm.  but it is just too bulky to be convenient for airline travel.  it takes up too much space, so i won't be bringing it on any more airline flights.  if you're not a minimalist when flying, like i am, you will love this blanket, but it's just not for me.
103759	my crawling baby is just learning to stand/balance, and i thought getting these for his upcoming baptism would be good, since he could wear them throughout the summer, too. well, he's in the 18-24m crib shoes from other brands, and i took a wild guess at 6.5 for these, and ended up way overshooting. they were enormous! so, unfortunately, if it's your first pair of stride rites, hit the store for a measurement. if you've bought the brand before and know what size to get, these are actually cute and ride the line between casual/dressy for a baby. i will probably revisit this style of shoe when i know what size to get.
103825	i love the fitflops and i have a pair that i wear all of the time. i did have to send these back because they were a little to small.i would recommend these shoes to anyone. they are great, cute and very comfortable. order a size up
103859	"i absolutely love this purse.  it is really cute and a beautiful shade of dark blue.  i have had two people comment on my ""real"" ostrich purse.  they even felt it and said ""oh my god, that is real.""  i just looked and them and smiled.  it is really large.  one day, it fit my nook, wallet, scarf, gloves and a medium size christmas gift.  it is a tad heavy (especially with all the crap i tote around).  i would buy it in other colors if i needed another purse.addendum:  after a few months of using this purse sporadically - the handles are peeling and the plastic piping is coming out of the stitching on one side.  i love this purse, but it is not very durable."
103890	i bought this pair on may, and it is now nov.  i have been wearing this pair for about 6 months, and i need to replace them as the back hill cushion has worn out that i can feel the ground.  it has been comfortable enough that i can walk without much problem.  but i wish it lasted longer.  it is not that i am using it for exercise and i am not on my feet for my job.  so why did it only last less than 6 months?
103920	"for people who complain that these are not hiking boots, of course they are not. the title of the product is ""walking shoe"". yes, they are kind of styled like hiking boots, but the construction is more like a walking shoe. the outer sole has a grippy rubber and minimal lugs, which is great on pavement, but not on mud. the midsole is kind of flexy, which is great on pavement, but not on rocks. the leather upper is stylish and weather resistant, but lighter weight and less durable than what you usually find on hiking boots. these shoes have eva midsoles which are comfortable, but break down much more quickly than the polyurethane midsoles found on serious hiking boots. i hope that these boots last more than a year of regular use. for the $70 sale price, these boots are a fine value, but not at the $100 retail price.sizing is fine for me. i bought my normal size 9 and it fits great. length is fine. width is on the narrow side, which i prefer. if you have extra wide feet, order a wider size, not a longer size. these do come in 3 different widths."
103981	my husband wanted a belt to wear to work, so this was one of two belts i ordered for my husband for christmas.  he doesn't like real large prominent buckles, and this one suited him fine. this is a nice reversible black/brown belt at a very nice price. both belts were returned because i ordered the wrong size, but we will definitely reorder in a larger size.
104119	"don't let the picture fool you--these things are ugly and huge.  ""full coverage"" isn't really what i was expecting from a ""bikini"".  if you like granny panties, go ahead.  i wear an xs or s in victoria secret sizes, and i think i ordered a 6 in these and they fit almost too tight, so hopefully that helps if you're trying to size these out."
104139	i just received these panties and have to say they are very comfortable and true to size. i have worn jockey for years and thought i would try these hanes briefs since the price was cheaper and i really needed some new underwear.  well they are a winner and i will definitely order some more.  the comfortsoft waistband and leg openings are very nice. only time will tell how long they will last. but for now i will give them 5 stars.
104173	i have a problem with underwear creeping up my backside.  i don't see how people can stand to wear thongs.......but i digress.  i was hoping these would not creep, and usually they don't, but sometimes they do and it's really annoying.  these are not my first pick out of the underwear drawer, and i usually only wear these when i've run out of others that i like better.
104236	was looking for cotton underwear, fit my requirements and fit size-wise as well.  comes up high on the hips, which is fine but not exactly as pictured.
104245	i bought these for pajama shirts and they work great. true to sizing. more like an undershirt, might wear for an everyday shirt.
104295	i wish they should provide a better sizing chart when ordering! the ones i ordered were too big :-( and cannot be returned now.
104417	i love gold toe socks because the sock will wear-out long before the elastic top looses its elastic stretch and hold.
104432	i love these socks!  they fit like a glove and have enough spandex in them to keep me happy.  all the blues are blue (not a black pair in there), the blacks and beiges are really nice too.  i really enjoy wearing them, they're such a nice quality and not too thick, but not chintzy, either.  i expect to be wearing these for a long time.
104566	i wear a 3x or a 4 x i ordered a 5x because i like to be able to move in it without tearing it.this is tight but wearable ..i needed hubby to help me take it of when i tried it on .i wished they had it in a 6 x .its very beautiful and elegant
104575	this was the first time i bought anything from evogues but it definitely won't be my last. this dress was so gorgeous and fit as perfectly as it looks in the picture. i love it when this happens, because it so rarely does. hope this review helps.
104585	this goes with anything in the closet and very fitted to my body shape love itits a must wear itam
104610	bought these for my mom and they run a bit wide.  nice shoe but not for a regular foot.  if you're foot is a bit on the wide side, it would be perfect.
104615	"the sleeves on my shirt still had a production sticker on them.......a sticker with a capitol letter l, to me that probably means ""large"".....so this tall sized shirt does not have tall specific sleeves. they just sew on regular sleeves to a tall shirt body, thus when i lift up my arm, the sleeves ride up and feels like my pits are hanging out.also no stretch in the neckband.........first time i out it on, the neck is already stretching out and mis-shaped, all i did was pull it over my head. the neckband is clearly a size or two larger. the neckband does not have any elastic at all.the sleeves are sewn on at an angle, that makes the shirt look better when your sleeves are at rest at your sides, but when you actually use your arms to reach for something, they ride up and bind at the top of your arm.material and construction seems really good, the overall torso and body length are also very good, and the shoulder room is perfect for my frame, but the pattern is wrong and the neckband is horrible.will try another version of the dickies shirt, perhaps the neckband problems area fluke or specific to the ""with wicking"" version."
104632	these are very comfortable sandals. just make sure to order one size larger than you normally wear. all men's and women's sandals run small.
104644	i'm not a flip flop person. i needed a pair for the pool/beach this year and wanted ones that were antimicrobial and comfortable. yes crocs are both but are over priced. these okabashi's are actually great. they seem to be formed in a mold so the strap and piece that goes between your toe is all one clean smooth piece. they are very soft even though they look like recycled rubber. they also are cushy and keep your feet from slipping out or to the sides. the best feature about these is that you can put them in the dishwasher or washing machine to clean them. i had an expensive pair of nautica's and they got wet from going in the pool, well they smelled like the garbage dump and they were brand new. the okabashi's didn't smell and they don't absorb water like most flip flops...love them and hope they last forever!
104717	we all know the kid won't wear it everyday or even for many times. but a memory/picture is always worth it later on.this specific costume looks very good and is cute on the kids.get it and you will be happy after few years that you got such thing.
104751	very nice piece considering i believe i spent approximately $15 for it.  my son loves it & used it in addition to his gladiator costume for halloween.  nice details & quality thick plastic.
104767	"i don't know who thought this was cute but it isn't. i am extremely offended by the title of this wig. since when did my natural textured hair become ghetto?? amazon, you messed up when you decided to carry this wig on your site and california costumes for making it! you would never find a wig titled ""trailer trash wig"" so why would you give this wig a title that personifies a stereo type?i am disgusted and deeply offended by this and i will submitting a formal complaint about this to corporate!"
104779	gorgeous, comfortable, excellent support, stretch material without bulk, lining or padding.  one of my all-time favorite bras! panache is a brand i search for in my uncommon size because they understand my shape.
104910	these socks are very well made, and well worth every penny. actually thigh high socks that go all the up my thigh. and i'm 6 foot and mostly legs so that is not an easy feat! nice and warm and super cute. i feel like these will last a good while.
104911	i ordered 3 pair of thigh-highs from the same company at the same time and i was charge the shipping charge for each one instead of one for all three.  i wish i would have caught this before i ordered.  i will never order from this company again.  i think that is a big sham.
104944	looks great, holds well, doesn't slip at all, light weight, dark buckle and grey color looks good with jeans. a little big for my 28&#34;-30&#34; waist, but easily remedied.
105065	"and this is an extra long, slightly oversized ribbed tank top. i'm 5'8"" and it hits me about mid thigh, so i wear a brown stretch skirt under it. i also have a very large chest, and this fits well without being tight. calling it a dress might be stretching the definition a bit."
105077	got these hoping they'd be warm enough for new england winter. they keep me nice and toasty as an outer garment and the cold air doesn't penetrate. i don't like the high waist so i fold them down. they look really nice and are long and stay down in my boots. but they are definitely very thick and stiff.
105091	wow, this is one of our number one finds with amazon, as this turtleneck is not only well-made, durable, easy wash and dry, long-lasting, we layer it with more of these same turtlenecks for added warmth in the winter and wear it single layer in our warmer months, and wear it as our soft turtleneck layer under wool garments to cushion our skin from woolly mild scratchiness with almost all wools of all kinds, and this item comes in a wide variety of colors, seems always to be available through american apparel and ships fast and arrives well-packaged in a timely manner, and the sizing is reliable and perfect, and we have absolutely no complaints for this item. we love this item and continue to order it for ourselves, our families and friends in almost all the colors available and everyone, so far, loves this turtleneck. we hope amazon always has it available to purchase, and its pricing is more than reasonable. we loove this turtleneck. thank you, amazon. blessings.
105098	i bought this inexpensive turtleneck to wear underneath sweaters. it had tiny holes in it..but i didn't return because it is perfect for what i bought it for
105117	it's just what i was looking for, xs size and cotton basis legging to treat  my skin nicely. by putting the leggings under , i can wear my shorter dresses. it's perfectly match my dresses and big shirts. thanks for the seller! i have ordered two times already. please keep yours and would buy more if needed one year later, ;-)
105118	these are a bit thin, but will do till i find the right ones, at least they are white (hard to find).
105141	my wife loved the fit and support the bra gqve, especially since it does nit have underwire which she sees as a plus.
105163	i love high-waist leggings, because they almost suck in that extra flab around the tummy for you! they tend to be a lot more comfortable to wear, than mid-rise leggings. these are great... i just wish they came in a shorter length for us short women.
105204	when they arrived yesterday, i was surprised that the earrings are quite nice and sized right for the price.  to me, they are perfectly sized and are prettier than the gold post pair (7.5-8 mm) that i own.thinking of purchasing a dozen or so to give as gifts.  can't go wrong with these.
105260	"this piece of jewelery caught my eye and i could not believe the price.  an 18"" necklacke with a pendant for under 20 dollars??  the price is terrific and the necklace is extremely pretty.  i got many compliments on this piece.  it did however break in less than 3 days.  the chain broke right at the clasp so be aware that the quality of the necklace doesnt equal the quality of the pendant."
105339	these boots are very well made. they also have a warm lining inside. i ordered them for my son. unfortunately, he has extra large calves so they did not fit with the lining. we took out the lining and they fit fine with sweatpants inside the boot. for normal, or small calves, [based on another person trying them on] there are several inches to enclose with the drawstring.
105341	i bought these boots for my twelve year-old.  he wears a size 9, but they're getting tight, so i bought him size 10, which he says fits fine.  i've been loyal to kamik for a long time.  the shoes always fit, they have a warm liner, and they're waterproof.  to top it off, they have a drawstring closure to keep out the snow.just a few days ago, we stood for hours in a cold stream panning for gold.  my son had no complaints.  his feet remained warm and dry throughout. i buy kamik boots every year for water and snow and will continue to do so. kamik does not disappoint. it is the perfect cold weather boot.
105394	these slippers in person look the same as in the picture.  they are very cute and almost run true to size but are actually a bit small.  i'd read the other reviews that said they run small but others say they stretch out after wearing so i went with my regular size 7 (sometimes size 6.5) but they fit exactly if not a bit small.  i'd like to slide my foot into the slipper but i always have to adjust the back each time i put them on and i think with a bigger size i wouldn't have to.  i can't wear socks with these either.  so if you plan to wear socks and are iffy of what size to order i'd recommend the bigger size.
105412	i like the slipper - but i would love it, if the back came up higher to cover my heels.  just a personal preference.
105477	i thought i was ordering a kids size skinny pants but i was mistaken.  i have returned these pants and have ordered a kids size skinny pants. when i got these pants they were very nice.
105509	"standing on your feet all day stinks.  these shoes makes that a bit easier to take.  i use them as ""scrub shoes"".  they have no holes, they are very comfortable.  the shoes do squeak a little until they are broken in."
105610	i purchased this in my normal shoe size of 11.5d and they fit just right.  quite often, i need to order a size 12 if the boot has insulation to allow for the extra thickness, but my heels slipped in the size 12 of this boot so i bought the 11.5 instead.  keen advises that most of their boots run a half size small (maybe even a full size small), so for me the anchorage is an exception to this.  in those i have tried that do run small, i could use a size 12.5, but that size is not available.the boots are easy to put on with the double pulls and my narrow heels do not slip while wearing a medium weight sock.  they are also warm and waterproof for winter wear, and i find them to be quite comfortable for my often tender feet.  they would be good for walking the dog in winter if you have this to do.  so i agree with the vast majority of the other reviewers that this is a great boot and can recommend them to others.  with amazon's return policies you really can't go wrong if they don't work out or you need to exchange sizes.  i bought the black color and have now ordered the brown also.
105614	i love the fact these slippers have an arch support, but the fit is quite snug.  i will be returning these.  i hoped that the fit would be roomy like the keen shoes, but it was not.  the slippers are comfortable, but too snug.
105637	i never want to take these slippers off! they fit my size 10, average width foot perfectly.  my feet don't get overheated and sweaty like many of the other slippers that i've had.  i love the support and the shoe like bottoms, that i can easily go outside with.  after 3 days, i could even slide my feet in with no hands, by wiggling my heel a bit.  i've loved all my well made keen shoes and now have a well made pair of keen slippers.
105720	nice looking shoe. it runs small so size up. does not have much support. could not be used as a walking shoe.
105721	these shoes fit as expected and are comfortable as can be.  they are relatively well made and durable and i have had no problems with them.  better made and more comfortable than a $100 pair of nikes.  also great for walking and exercise, they look as modern as they are functional.
105787	i love this sneaker. the fit is great, not too tight on the toes or squeezing on the top of the foot and it fits true to size. i am a size 7.5 and it fits perfectly. the sneaker is attractive and  can be worn with jeans , shorts, skirts, etc. the color is awesome and looks quite trendy. i plan on buying a few more pairs/colors of the skechers bikers dream come true brand.
105864	i could use some tights in black, but i wanted espresso for a certain event. good thing i had a pair hanging about---with runs. ew. i have yet to try them on, but i am familiar with the brand. i'll probably just keep them!
105918	good product. well made. prompt shipping and product arrived in good condition.  sizes run slightly small as other reviewers have said so i upped the size by one and they fit very good.  the side panels are a little higher than other moccassins so they rubbed a little at first which took a little getting used to, but ok now.
105949	i bought this bag through amazon to take to europe on vacation and use as a day pack while walking.  i never overloaded the bag, using it to schlep a bottle of water, a rick steves' guide book, a table-top tripod and some candy bars.  i didn't use the side bottle pockets because of comments i had previously read on amazon of problems with it.  despite careful handling, the bag's top hanging handle started to separate from the bag during the trip. careful inspection revealed that the bag is really poorly assembled with what looks like wide basting stitches. using a sewing machine back home, we stitched over all the seams and will be taking the reinforced bag on another vacation. i am 5 foot 9 inches tall and had to extend the straps to their full length to wear the bag on my shoulders. it could be a nice day bag, but it is really a cheaply made product that is not constructed by the chinese factory to last while traveling.  i like the rick steves' guide books a lot, but with this poor quality, he should be ashamed to endorse this civita day pack.
105979	update: i am able to now adjust it so the cup is just a little better.previous: most reviewers had urged to go a band size larger, but this did not work for me. i am 36b and although the band is ok the cup seems not to fit (i purchased 38b). in addition to which the straps cannot be adjusted.the fact that the nursing flaps goes further down than other bras did not impress me (i was looking forward to that). i have another 'cheap', unpadded bra that fits  better and, although the flap does not go all the way down in that one, seems to work better than this one. it is also difficult to re-hook. single-handedly. it really doesn't flatter me, and this will not be my go-to maternity bra. case in point the bra does not necessarily runs small! in my opinion it is either hit or miss, no acceptable compromise!
106023	this isn't really worth my time.  it's incredibly cheap, like something out of a machine at the store for 50 cents.  the leather is thin.  the clasp is very lightweight.  not good at all. sent it back.
106037	the socks are used as regular knee highs not over the knees. my height is 5'7&#34; weight 147 lbs,  so they just come to the bottom of my knees.
106065	rhinestones, red, cateyes..meow...!  these glasses are fantastic!  they really top off my wiggle dress.  perfect for any pin up girl to top off an outfit.
106109	this is the only hat of this type i have found that does not constantly work it's way up and off; resulting in a weird sticking up point.it also has more of a rounded crown with little angularity.i wear a 7 1/2 hat.  i saw one review complaining about a tight fit.  i get a loose/just tight enough fit; so, i don't get that.it does not seem scratchy to me, but scratchy wool does not bother me.
106129	if you're searching for a huge bag that's ultra light weight, this would be the one. i needed a large bag that would hold everything my 12 year old twins would need for a week away at summer camp, but that was also light enough they could each carry one without it being too heavy. these bags were just what i was looking for.each bag arrives in a small box, and when you pull it out, you realize just how light they are. most kids backpacks weigh more than these bags, and they're only 1/3 the size. when you unfold it, you realize just how huge this duffle is.the zipper opens up much father than even necessary. it unzips in a way that you can almost completely open and lay flat the entire bag. when i started packing it, i was amazed at how much i was able to fit inside. for each bag, each of my kids took a weeks worth of denim jeans, shorts, tops, sweatshirts, two pairs of shoes, undergarments and socks, toiletries and hair care supplies and  something to sleep in. both of my kids also each took a large pillow in their bags (sleeping bags they carried seperatly) and they had a small tote bag stuffed inside the duffle filled with their books and paperwork they needed to bring along. these bags were able to hold all of this, and could have been filled even more. they were by no means overfilled. this makes it easier also for my kids to repack their own bags to bring everything home. last year i used smaller duffle bags (that were tons heaver) and i crammed everything in with no room to spare. my kids ended up being unable to fit everything back inside. with these giant duffles, it's not a problem, since there's plenty of room to spare.i bought the black and red bag for my son and the turquoise color for my daughter. the black and red looks just like it's pictured, but the turquoise wasn't the same shade at all. it was a deep teal blue/green. i actually like this color a lot more, and so did my daughter. not nearly as light of a blue as pictured. it's much deeper and with a lot more green in it.
106146	we use this for the baby jogger city mini when we travel. fits well and protects it from the worst of baggage handlers, but then folds down to a small package that can be packed away.
106204	"the watch is great, but i haven't worn it yet because the band is huge. what type of lady was this watch made for? i am considered ""big boned"" and i probably need 2 links taken out of this watch."
106205	this is my first rose gold watch. it's very pretty and the time is easy to read thanks to the big face. the detail of the face is lovely and the chrono dials definitely add a little more pizzaz to the face. as others have mentioned, it's pretty big since it was made to mimic a man's watch, or your bf's watch. however, it doesn't look overly masculine because of the crystals surrounding the bezel. i also think the color makes it look a tad girly. i had 4 links removed, just enough to have some slack on my wrist. it has a good weight to it, but not omg-my-arm's-gonna-fall-off heavy. i love pairing it with bracelets to give it a chunky and an even more feminine look. i've had this watch for about a month now and it still looks the same as when i first received it. thank goodness i haven't experienced the rose gold rubbing off yet, and i hope i won't! as with anything plated, it will scuff off where it has had friction and rubbing over time; just like yellow gold-plated jewelry.one thing i will note - this watch was shipped from jomashop. when i received it, two of the links close to the face of the watch has a portion that looks like it oxidized after being scratched. i contemplated on returning it and requesting for another of the same watch, but when i checked back on their site, they no longer had any in stock. it's a minor defect, but i would have loved it even more had i received it in flawless condition.
106310	this onesie is the same size as all of my newborn clothes!  i bought it for my son to wear to a wedding when he's six months old and i'm sure he'll be too big for it by then.  not only that, the screen print is a little cheesy and the material is thin and kind of chintzy.  save your twenty bucks and buy some other version of this.
106328	this is a special watch it is great the color pops and i wear it everyday since i got it beautiful  and all my friends like it to so i said go to amazon and buy yourself one thank you very much will buy again
106373	the fabric washes very well and comes out of the dryer looking good - no wrinkles, stitches don't shrink up.  there does not appear to be any shrinkage in the fabric.  i bought another pair in another color right after the first washing because i was so pleased with the quality.
106395	i ordered 6 shirts(2 navi, 2 dark grey, 2 khaki). i wear these shirts to work everyday. first time owner and love them a ton. i will be buying more carhartt products in the near future.
106411	on a full term average sized baby these would fit perfectly.i would definitely recommend them.very sweet design and classic colours.
106412	these shoes are really comfortable and cute. my baby 13 months old loves it. usually she take off her shoes and these do not.
106425	we are still using these at 9 months. they are good little socks and worth the money. plus, it doesn't matter if you lose one...
106433	they'll probably stretch but they seem pretty small for a newborn even. i prewashed them and there are already strings starting to come loose. we'll see how long they last. i'll probably look for a different brand to try next time.
106434	i got these socks for my 7 month old.  she loves to pull her socks off and these stay on really well!  good deal for the price.
106442	is ok, at least is good to know the weight of you luggage before going to the airport, so that way if is more you can make arrangement in your house.
106471	bought thinking it might get lost on mail or something, since its not a prime send product, it came alright, 3 weeks to california. it is a great gift, it comes in a nice bag with the little luck cat for the cell phone, i put it on the car, but you can put it in your cell... the bracelet was a gift for the wife, she loves it, already using it. great for praying or just as a luck charm.really love it. if you practice it really helps with the energy.
106554	the fit and texture of these white pants is awesome and i'm delighted with the coolness while i'm out on the beach in direct sun.....light and airy is perfection
106558	ordered where they would not be tight on me but instead they were really baggy.  maybe a size down might of fit but was leavingfor mexico in two days and couldn't use them.
106614	"i loved the look of the tee so much that i exchanged it twice to see if one size would work for me.  however, at 5'11"" - 185 lbs, the large was too large and the medium was too small and i finally gave up.  adidas must be catering to the ""over-weight american"" because their shirts seem to always be a 1/2 size larger than nike, ua, et. al."
106645	i wasnt even trying to shop for jeans, and found these on a whim!  according to other reviews, they were the best so i had to find out for myself. these are just the right amount of stretch, they dont get stretched out after wearing all day, and the tummy panel is not too low, not too high. perfect!! if you have any shape, i can almost guarantee these will fit you perfectly. great job, levis. these will be my new faves and i will buy them in more colors!  also i love skinny jeans, but these are not too wide to wear with flats and not too skinny to go out of style. they will last forever i bet. yay!!
106673	this bag works very well for my wedding dress. i was worried because i have a very very very poofy dress. the bag holds the dress very well and i feel confident that nothing will happen to my dress. this was an excellent value for the price.
106674	as advertised. it's a thin &#34;re-use shopping bag&#34; material, but it's not see through at all. it does the job (which is hiding my dress from curious eyes!). it did smell yucky when i got it, but after some febreeze and a 15 minute tumble in no-heat air drying, it went away.
106702	i ordered a 38 d, but perhaps needed a dd.  that seems crazy, but maybe i have a lot of milk.  i would say this product runs a bit small.  order a cup size up.  i do like the bra itself... supportive, and good quality.
106754	i'm very happy with this purchase.  when i first received my mala, the beads were a boring shade of tan and looked very uninteresting.  but, i didnt purchase them for their appearance.  within a few weeks, the beads started to change color.  they are now an absolutely beautiful varigated shade of greens and gold.  i didn't know that would happen, but am pleasantly surprised and delighted.  i keep them on my desk at work, draped over the corner of my computer monitor.  the remind me to stay centered and focused. i'm planning to get more.
106765	very nice mala beads with 108 standard number of beads. they have a slight fragrance of sandalwood. item may have taken a little while for delivery,however,it arrived within expected date. i am so very pleased with this purchase.
106829	these weren't what i was expecting, but i like them anyways. after going through tons of different brands of nickel free and other types of earrings for sensitive ears and having bad reactions (and wasting a lot of money) i was hesitant to buy these, but i love them! they don't bother me ears at all. they're actually plastic posts and backs which are much more comfortable that you'd expect and easy to put in. they're a little cheap as far as quality, but also in price, so it's not a problem! they are smaller than i expected and from the picture i was expecting there would be a variety of sizes in teh box, but they are all the same size. would definitely reccomend!
106915	"this necklace was beautiful,very delicate. the length was no were near 37"" it was 18"" less than half the expected length. i called amazon and they promised to send another with free overnight shipping. the representative told me she would follow through and make sure the new necklace was the correct length. the second necklace was 15 inches long and i could'nt fit it over my head. i sent both necklaces back very disappointed yesterday. i would say no quality controls at the place they are made. i wanted a long necklace not a short one."
106938	this is a really nice tie clip for the price by kenneth cole. i do wish it was either a little more thick ot longer, doesn't always stay straight for the perfect fit.
106966	i am in love with these shoes, they are the most comfortable sneakers i have owned. i'm not a fan of the other teeter totterlooking shape-ups, these just look like normal athletic shoes. i have lower back problems, my pain has pretty much subsided since wearing these to walk in. i also seem to have lost inches since wearing these. i ordered a 9, these shoes seem to run a little bit big. i hope skechers keep making these shoes. i am a complete believer!
107037	after my first purchase of these, i wore them for 6 months and had to buy 3 more - attractive length, don't ride up (and i'm 191# female!), great for crossfit.
107060	these were so cute and flattering but they were a good 3-4 inches too long so i returned them. i'm 5'4&#34;.
107087	i had ordered this bali bra through one hanes place and loved it!  i paid almost $10.00 more than what's listed here, and was thrilled to see it available thru amazon.  it is extremely comfortable, the underwire cannot be felt, very supportive, the sides are plenty high, so no overflow there, and i love the closure because there are no tags to chafe.  the fabric is beautiful and soft.  bra does not ride up and straps don't fall.  fits very well.  i would highly recommend it.
107096	this is my second time ordering this bra. i bought it in black and liked it so ordered it in nude also. it is pretty comfortable and the lining and petals make sure there is no show through when it's cold (if you catch my drift). i wear it for everyday and work. the only drawback, but i find this with most larger bras is that it does flatten you out a little. i am a 34dd 5'6 150 pounds.
107153	i generally hate strapless bras, but this is a good one.  this bra is fairly comfortable (very comfortable for a strapless) and looks nice under the dress i bought it for.  it stays in place and i am not trying to discreetly tug it up all day.two notes for other shoppers:1. i am normally a larger 34d and sometimes have to go dd.  in this style, i am a comfortable d.  seems to be a bigger bra.2. this is not a bra for a low rise top.  as shown in the picture, there is a pretty thick band.  yes, this makes it stay up more comfortably and makes a smoother line under your clothes, but if you want to wear a top with a plunging neckline, big arm holes, or a low back, you'll have to look elsewhere.
107207	i have worn isotoner gloves for 30 years and love them. this pair of gloves is no exception. b plus.
107265	i ordered this bra in every color in the same size and all of them fit except the black which is almost a size smaller
107287	i ordered an x-lg even though i am on the small side (123 lbs.), because i had tried a large on in a store and it hurt my back and strap area.  when it came, it was very wrinkled so i had to wet it down in the sink and hang it to dry.  hope that takes the wrinkles out.  i don't have very large 'girls' but need the black as i have mostly beige and white bras and needed a black with no underwiring.  i have a few black tank tops so needed something black to go under them.
107436	the fleece looks exactly like the photo on amazon; i ordered a women's extra small in beet, and based on the previous reviews, i thouight it best to order a size smaller than i would normally get, which worked out perfectly. the fleece is roomy, so definitely keep that in mind. the color is rich and beautiful, and has a nice feminine silhouette. very happy.
107552	i needed a light colored fleece vest... and i thought this one was perfect. however, when i received the vest in the mail, i was disappointed to learn how thin the vest actually is. it's not your fluffy, thick fleece. it's one-sided, and very thin. anything i tried to wear under it was clearly visible through the vest all the way around. it's pretty, but i wouldn't wear it for warmth or fashion.
107699	i found this hp robe to be substantial, making it drape very well. the clip at the neck, however, was useless.
107702	i was expecting cheap costume quality.  this is actually a nice robe.  no need for coat when trick or treating because this kept my daughter warm all by itself.
107735	i bought this in a 3x instead of smaller because i have bigger upper arms and wanted it to fit without pinching or stretching (cuz that's not nice looking). it's a long cardigan, the lace goes all the way across the back (along the top), and it is free flowing (no belt or buttons). looks great over the evogues sexy plus size floral lace corset top red.
107761	a very nice smooth and comfortable top long to the hips with a nice drape and gathered lacey sleeves that end at the elbow. can be dressed up or down.
107764	beautiful top when you first get it. the lace gets really stringy and hangs down all over the place, gets very itchy and ugly. i on the other hand can't take no for an answer because it's such a beautiful top, so i just cut the hanging strings off that i can. it always comes back though. also the sleeves are longer than the picture looks, i have to roll mine up a little. it's okay but i kinda wish it wasn't lace, the material is awful!
107771	the material isnt very soft, and it runs small in sizing. i am not very pleased. the left arm doesnt have any sort of sleeve, or hem for that matter. the hole you see to the right of the rose is the picture is the arm hole.....not especially happy
107881	i was so grateful to find this band - my timex ironman triathlon has served me well and still works perfectly, so i hated the thought that i'd have to buy a new one just because the band broke after some years. this is the original timex band for the 100-lap watch, and it fits perfectly. as other have said, keep the original pins, and get all women, children, and easily-frightened small pets out of the house before you attempt installation.having been through it, here's how i recommend installation:1) it's easiest to remove the old band by cutting it away with a very sharp knife, so you don't damage the original retainer pins. once the strap is gone, it's easy to remove the spring-loaded restainer pins with a knife or sharp fingernail by pushing on the shoulder of the pin at one of the ends, where it goes into the watch. you may even be able to just grab the pin and just push one direction or the other, along the axis of the pin.2) the supplied pins were either slightly too long, or the spring inside was so stiff, i couldn't get them to click into place, and i tried for a long time. good luck if you want to or have to use them - i used the old ones. have a knife or something with a very thin and narrow blade ready - you'll need it for the installation. don't cut yourself in the process - i'm not responsible if you screw up and hurt yourself or damage something!3) hold the band in your right hand. insert the pin into its hole in the band. push it in so the the pin sticks out pretty far on the side closest to your body, and just barely on the other side.4) hold the watch in your left hand. hold the band level with the watch and at an angle toward your body, so you can insert the side of the pin that's sticking out of the band the furthest into the hole on the watch. when you get it in there, press the watchband into position as far as you can, until the pin on the opposite side contacts the metal body of the watch.5) now the fun part. using a sharp, narrow blade, push against the end of the spring-loaded retainer pin that's sticking out of the band until it's even with the hole in the band, and push the band against the watch so the pin slides inside the metal bracket. this process takes 3 hands, and a fluent vocabulary of 4-letter words, and appeals to whatever god you worship, sometimes in combination. carefully move the watchband around a little bit inside the bracket until you hear the pin click into place. be careful not to move it around so much that the pin slips back out, and you're back to using the knife to push it back down - that's the hardest part of the procedure!6) pull gently on the strap to make sure the pin has properly snapped into place.7) repeat for the other half of the watchband, and you're done! i probably spent about 20 minutes on the installation. it would go quite a bit faster now that i know what to do.
107929	"this carhartt shirt jacket is great! i am 6""8"" and over 300lbs, so i am a big guy. i bought the 3x tall and it is amazing. the sleeves are a little long, but i am glad it is a little too big, as it will probably shrink over time as i wash it. the canvas material seems very durable and the inside lining is nice, warm and soft. i bought this for going on camping trips and retreats, and i am excited about using it this winter!"
107983	the asics gel-kayano 17 shoe is the most comfortable running shoe i have ever purchased. in fact i just bought my third pair. i want to let everyone know that these shoes are not just for running (i never run anymore!) but are great for just walking and everyday use. i have plantar faciitis and lots of heal and arch pain the extra gel cushion in these shoes is a life saver! my foot doc said to buy running shoes since they have more cushion and support than any other sneaker. in my book asics gel-kayano is the hands down winner! i love love these comfortable sneakers. one more note my husband has also fallen in love with this style asics and has them in 3 different colors too!!
107989	i have flat feet as bad as they get. in most shoes walking a few miles can get painful. these shoes give my foot excellent support around the entire foot and the bottom absorbs shock and spreads the weight evenly when the foot comes down. the shoe flexes nicely to allow the foot to flow through the step. the shoe has a removable inside bottom cushion that's removable for people needing custom padding for their foot. as bad as my feet are that isn't necessary for me but it's good to have. i don't know if the padding will last as long as the rest of the shoe. these are excellent walking shoes and i'd recommend them highly.
107992	since asics doesn't make the kayano walking shoes anymore i had to try this gel-tech neo.  some of the reviewers thought this was a great shoe, i did not. i had pain in my left foot the first time i wore them.  i wouldn't recommend these for anyone who has flat feet or is used to a better quality of asics walking shoes. i walk 4+ miles every other day so i need a shoe that is supportive and takes the shock off the road.  this isn't the one. not sure where i going to find a shoe like the kayano walkers.
108006	i wore these for the first time yesterday and i do love them.  other reviewers stated that they were very comfortable and they did not disappoint!
108022	it is the second time i get the same shoes and of the same color.i wear mine everyday all day long.  i run 5 miles in the morning, then get into the same shoes to go to work, so, i basically wear mine 10 hours/day and they last for about 6 months for me.  very very comfortable!
108027	this is my second pair of asics women's gt 2160. they are perfect for my feet problems by providing great comfortable support. i thoroughly recommend these shoes especially if you suffer from plantar fasciitis. my podiatrist also checked my previous 2160s and stated that i should stick with asics. thank you.
108033	"i read a review in ""runners world"" about these shoes. i ran a 10k in november and i was very pleased. lightweight,feels good on my feet and for a very good price."
108043	as if walking on a thick layer of gel. that's what my husband described his new pair of asics. he loved it, in fact, we bought two pairs. will definitely buy more. it was great that they come with extra wide sizes. my husband's work requires him to be on his feet almost throughout his shift, in the er, and he used to get sore feet and back ache. with this comfy pair of wonderful gel, he doesn't complain of sore feet and back ache anymore. additionally he noticed that the shoe really breathe well, no more sweaty feet.great shoes!!!
108095	having a small collection of watches, which are mainly affordable automatics, except a few chromos. i wanted to get the best of 2 worlds. a quartz watch with a sweeping second hand, and precise to 10 seconds a year. having sized the band and wearing it , i have come to love this watch. comfortable @ 43mm, and not to heavy. i was simply taken aback by the details on the face, raised metal numerals. my original thoughts of how the crystal would look were completely forgotten. this watch will be in the rotation more than the others. simple fact...great value.
108162	for me, this bra didn't fit well in the cup area.  there was extra fabric.  also, i don't like seams on the cups because it isn't as smooth.  it didn't lift and support as in the photo.  many people obviously do like it, though, and it may fit you.i ordered 2 other styles of bras by playtex that fit and support me much better.  my favorite of the two is the ultimate lift and support bra.  it's very smooth in the cup area and lifts and supports as in the photo.  by the way, i ordered the same size as this gel comfort strap bra.  i first ordered one to see if it would work for me.  then, i ordered 2 more.of course, everyone is different.  this is what worked for me.it also has a higher review rating here on amazon.
108203	ever notice how a lot of bras that tout cleavage-inducing construction just aren't all that comfortable? luckily that is not the case with this bra. the underwire is the most comfortable of any underwire bra i have owned. i almost forget it has underwiring. straps are comfortable, don't dig in nor poke through if you wear a more sheer, form-fitted top or t-shirt. though advertised as adding a bra size (without going the surgical route), i would say its construction--the gel padding is at the bottom of the cups and wraps upward on the sides a little--more firms the breasts and enhances cleavage to give a more natural-looking uplift to what the good lord gave you and gravity fights to take away, lol. unlike a lot of cup size-inducing victoria' secret bras, which, imo, often make women look freakish, unnatural, this bra's padding, as i said, does more to reverse the inevitable effects of aging/gravity. i am a natural 38c and that is the size i bought. and i still look like myself, but more rounded (ahhh, those wonder years of your 20s), firmer, and maybe a half cup-size bigger. sort of the kind of uplift you would get working with weights to build up your chest muscles with biceps and triceps curls and pushups. the clasp is comfortable--no digging into your back and irritating the skin as so many bras do. i bought the nude color with the inside leopard spots(?) style, and the 'spots' do not show through wearing light-colored tops. of course that may not be the case underneath sheer, white or off-white summer fabrics. but it works fine for the heavier fabrics of fall and winter, even early spring.so all in all, a stylish, well-fitting, comfortable bra with straps and clasp and underwires that don't dig into the skin, and gel-padded in a manner that in smaller-busted women may make your breasts look noticeably bigger but that in c-cup women, gives a rounding and uplift that is more natural looking but gives the illusion of being a half-size or so bigger than you are. a purchase well worth the surprisingly, imo, low price.
108217	this shoe, this shoe will crush your toes, i got the first pair in what i wear, 8.5, after 5 mint run i had no feeling in my toes, i sent back, got a 9, put on to big, heal comes out, this is not a shoe for the runner, walker maybe, but looks good just order larger then what u wear, wont buy these again,
108229	i love this so much that i plan to get the brown/fall colored one. i used this to pair with a green lace dress i wore to my daughter's communion and many people wanted to know where i got it; did i make it; is it an heirloom, etc.  great price, too!!!
108231	i saw something similar at an arts and crafts show, and i was incredibly sad that it was out of my price range. a few months later, i was searching for something like it and i found this! i swear it's the same purse! i bought it for a reasonable price, and i've used it twice for special occasions. it's very well-made, and i've gotten several compliments on it.
108232	this is a lovely evening bag.  it just arrived, so i haven't used it yet so i don't know how durable it is.  but it arrived in perfect condition in the protective bag that usually comes with high-end bags.  the size is perfect, too.  not too big or not too small.  the bag is well made and appears sturdy.  since it is covered with sequins, you will have to take care not to abuse it.  it is truly a beautiful bag.
108246	just received this bag tonight.  i purchased it for an upcoming cruise and i absolutely love it.  i have searched for weeks for a bag that was not to big and not to small.  my cell phone, hard case wallet, compact, and lip stick fit in it with room to spare.  its size and vintage style were just what i had been looking for.  some reviews have complained of a chemical odor, but my bag did not smell in the slightest.  i would highly recommend this bag for any one wanting a larger, elegant evening purse.  the seller also shipped it lightning fast.  i ordered on tuesday and ups actually tried to deliver yesterday (less than 24 hours after i ordered) but i was not home.  my shipping option on this was 3 to 5 days so i am very impressed with how fast i received this beautiful item.
108257	very lovely and delicate purse.  different and so lady like.  reminds you of the days of old when ladies were ladies.  perfect for special occasions and the bead work is fantastic.  perfect for my needs.
108340	i got these jeans for my daughter and she loves the fit and we received quickly and exactly what i ordered.  thanks!
108342	"these say lower on the waist but they went above my belly button. the cut is relaxed and roomy in the thighs. i am 42...5'6"" 140 and the 6 seemed huge even though it fit in the waist and butt,  it got really big in the thighs. not an attractive cut"
108355	this bag is pretty big and hold a lot of stuff.  so very pretty and great quailty.  was a great buy!!!
108505	i ordered this timex in purple for my 10 year old daughter. she adores the vivid color of the wrist strap. the digital time on the watch is easy to see and there are several different options for stop watch functions and such. there is an indiglo feature on it, where with a push of a button a bright green/blue back-light comes on, letting you see the time in the dark. the light has a self-timer and goes off  on its own after a few seconds.the wrist strap easily fits an array of wrist sizes. i tried it on and it fits my adult (women's sized) wrist, but also fits my daughters 10 year old pre-teen sized write.setting the time is best done by an adult, as there are several buttons and it could be a bit tricky for kids.my daughter is quite hard on things, constantly playing outside with friends and coming home a mess every day. this watch has held up through her daily abuses and is still ticking. definitely a great watch for a young lady.
108535	fits nicely, works well, looks good. my daughter wears this all day every day. into the ocean, swimming in the pool, riding horses, everything. she is 12 and loves this watch.
108568	"my first expedition analog/digital was purchased 8 years ago and every function still works -- but it's kinda beat up.  my leather band is gross and the face is a bit scratched up.  i don't remember exactly what i paid for it 8 years ago but it was around $40.  what a deal then, what a better deal now. it was my favorite travel watch for keeping track of what time it is at home from far away.  no calculations, just look at the digital read out -- great for challenged people like myself.  plus it has a stop watch function which i used pretty regularly, an alarm loud enough to wake me up even when i'm on meds, a 24 hour timer which i never found a use for, and a day and date function. other reviewers negative on the readout are correct -- the shadow from the face makes reading some of the readout difficult, especially the tiny ""a"" or ""p"" for am and pm.  nevertheless, i ordered a new one and discovered it is somewhat different.  this one has a wider case.  the analog face is brighter with cleaner markings and 13-24 hour printout around the dial. (the digital readout, unfortunately, appears to be the same)  overall, it is still a value.  i also own a low end tag heuer that is an attractive watch and well made but also cost 30 times more than the timex. for less than $40 this timex is the best deal out there.  hey, if it konks out after a year, it's only 40 bucks.  put another way, i could buy one a year for 30 years and still not break even with the tag."
108578	returning. very hard to read when using the indiglo light, also a dark spot defect at bottom of watch face, which makes it even harder to read. looks nice but that's as far as quality goes on this watch.
108619	this watch has class written all over it.very nice to have the classic with a black face and white numbers on the dial.indiglo is a proven needed feature.this watch will go with dress or work clothes and can be as tough as it needs to be.glad timex finally made this one.
108620	have had a timex for years.. the present one is like the last two. it shows day & date. the new one--being reviewed--only shows the date. watch strap is thin. however,  i might go to wmt and get a band that fastens itself;. my concern is trying to get the calendar to work.  for now, even though the older timex has lost some accuracy, i am hesitant to  fully switch--am carrying the new one in my pocket but wearing the old. i like the black face, white dials and luminous feature.
108624	these easy readers have been my daily watch for the past five years. i always have one in brown and one in black. they tell, time, look nice without seeming tacky or gaudy, and at this price point i don't have to worry about one biting the dust from time to time. the only line of watches i'd ever recommend and as long as they make them, the only ones i'll buy.
108630	my granddaughter loves her new shoes.  they are made well and the fit is good.  she will use these shoes for church and special occasions. there is no need to spend lots more money for that other brand.
108656	"i am 5'10"" and about 145lbs but pregnant at the moment ( so alittle bit chunkier than usual ). am glad my bigger part of my pregnancy will be in sping and summer, so i decided not to buy maternity clothes. the are simply very expensive and ugly. so i decided my maternity clothes will be nothing but dresses and tights ( on the colder days ). this dress is very long, ( i rarely come across a maxi dress that's actually maxi for my height ) which is what i was hoping for ( after reading some reviews from taller ladies ). it's very flatering and doesn't even show my 'baby bump"" at 3 months. i love that i can wear this dress during maternity and after ( to hide the baby fat ). my husband loved this so much that he ordered me a secong one. definately recoment this dress."
108677	i love this black shiny shoe from naturalizer however, my toes were scrunched. i purchased the wide but it didn't help.  sorry naturalizer, it isn't easy finding a great shiny pump with just the right height and thickness of heel.  ugh.. back to the drawing board!
108702	as a shoe fanatic, i needed professional looking work shoes for an office setting that could stand being walked in for several hours comfortably. note that i am well used to walking in 4-5 inch heels. these shoes seem small for the sizing. and actually hurt more than any four inch heel that i already have. i literally have to put flats on the second i step out of the room-and take these off. i would have returned them but i am past the date. they are that bad. the leather is also getting weird creases/pulling around the toes that i haven't seen with other leather shoes i own-and i own only leather shoes-plastic shoe is disgusting. i am assuming it is because this is thin and not a high quality leather. i wish i could return these. sigh. i am an 8, bought an 8 and a half and they seemed fine when i tried them on. beware.so shoes that hurt, terribly and are ugly to boot. great.
108735	great shirt. soft, nice color, looks good with jeans or sweatpants. you can dress it up or work out in it. really great
108867	i ordered a size medium, and it fit way too big on me. the arm holes are far too large, and there is too much extra material on the sides. perhaps this would be good if you like to wear heavy sweatshirts under your vests, or have a larger chest and/or torso area. however, i prefer to wear long-sleeve t shirts under my vests. i am 5'5 and 137 lbs.
108885	i'm torn on the star rating b/c while i like the shirt, i have some issues with it that can be fixed simply by amending the title for this item.first off, the item came extremely fast! i got an alert on my phone that it was to arrive 2 days after i ordered it when i hadnt paid for any special shipping and i thought there was no way it could be my shirts...impressive!second, i actually like the fabric. it is lightweight but still soft and just feels comfy without causing me to overheat. i live in socal in an office with fluctuating temperatures so i dont want to have to be undressing and redressing all day long. i bought two and have since worn both to work and was very pleased. the color was true to the picture. the seams and buttons seem to be done well.now the bad stuff - this shirt is by no means tailored. unless the designer thinks women don't have waists, a size small should never be that wide. tailored in my mind means (like its pictured) cinch at the waist, flare out towards the bottom and curved seams on the sides making the front and back longer and the hips more flattering. also the arms are very bulky around the arm pits. this is not the cut. i look like i'm wearing my boyfriends dress shirt, in my size. i prefer to have a more clean and modern look for work. this is a little too..frumpy?the neck-line is fine with me, as others have complained about being too low, b/c i wear a tank top underneath it and don't button it or if i do, only the middle two buttons. i do feel the press for the collar should have been lower. i have ironed mine to fold farther down which has helped it achieve that more feminine look and less like a guys shirt.
108957	i had to go to a 40s theme party so i needed the pantyhose with the line down the back. so cute! i am going to start buying them for every occasion it gives you legs a little something extra
108969	okay so not really,  bought them for wife to wear, she loves them, seem to hold up well and are stylish
108990	cute bag, but after one day of use, both handles ripped out of their holes.  this bag was not designed well.  do not buy this, you will be sorely disspointed or you will spend alot of hours trying to figure a way to salvage it so it can be used.  whoever designed this should have put more thought into it.  a bag needs to look good and function well.
109089	i got a couple of these for my gf. she loves the fact that they are very soft and thin, so wonderful to sleep in during the summer. however, she feels they are a bit on the baggy side and would have liked them to be more form-fitting to add a little sexy to them. so she doesn't use them a lot around me. i bought them for a really good deal, but wouldn't pay regular price for them.
109201	best watch ever! stylish, great clasp and a nice weight! perfect all season watch. the bracelet is a little hard to adjust to size. definately a jeweler's job. a black or brown would be nice too.
109239	these watches are a great little bargain.  i have them in each color, to coordinate with different outfits.  they keep time accurately and hold up nicely.
109250	love the flexible band and bling.  i wish the face of the watch was a lighter color, even white.  in certain lighting, the glare from the crystal and the coloring of the watch face makes it tricky to read.  overall, i would still buy it.
109297	columbia men's ultimate roc pant, flax, 32x34. made in sri lanka.pros:soft, thin material.cons:baggy in the ankles, not like the picture?they don't seem durable as advertised.100% cotton.update: 11/9/12: they lasted through the summer but i only wore them a couple times. i can't seem to find an appropriate place to wear them.update 4/16/13: zipper and button seem cheap. i hope they don't break.
109357	my negative reviews aren't popular, but i'll take the heat. this new version isn't made like the old ones (my old one was stolen). this jacket is falling apart after about 100 days wear. the problem is the stitching. the factory in jordan (yes jordan) tnf used to make this used what's called single stitching. if one stitch breaks, which it does, the seam unravels with nothing to stop it. all the stitching is some cheap nylon, or worse, cotton thread. its literally falling apart.  for this price it's not worth it when there are equivalent products at your local 'big box' store for $30.  tnf, spend an extra dollar on double lock stitching.
109433	quality exceeds what was expected.  am considering ordering more in other colors because i was so pleased with this one. can easily be used as a small tote not exclusively for shoes.
109497	ladies, what are you thinking?  these are hideous looking.  no guy would find these flattering.  please, do no buy/wear these.
109524	these caps are ok for us bald or shave headed guys. have to pull like hell to get them over your ears and each of the 3 bought seems to be frustratingly small. no, my ears are not that big ! ;-)
109543	so sexy, it made for a fun and exciting night as she kept me looking at her and made for a great night well made for something so skimpy
109547	but it's just 4 straps with some chains!  not much to it, and not really a thong.  the back would look the same as the front of the picture without chains pretty much.
109570	cute little thong panty.  one size fit's most i suppose,  i'm 5'6 120 lbs and it seems a little baggy in the...only area where there's cloth...  i will be able to tighten it up with a quick stitch job though.  not made with the greatest materials, so it seems a bit pricey.  the string is a thin elastic band and the fabric just sort of slides around it.  easily adjustable if you need to shrink it up.
109588	"""set of 2 - 12 page plastic wallet inserts for pictures or credit cards......(be sure to look at the illustration to see the fit)"".....that's the description from which i placed my order in good faith that was to be part of a christmas gift, promised to arrive before christmas. it arrived over a week after christmas, and it was 4 inserts for a bi-fold wallet, late and useless. i contacted the company, and was told in a long, drawn-out email that an employee had posted the wrong information, and they were sorry. (a month later, i see the same information is still up there.) they also said a lot of other people had suffered the same mix-up. does that make it okay?i haven't returned them yet, not quite worth the hassle of repackaging and taking to the post office. i may include them in a box of donated items for ""good will"".i had hoped they'd apologize and simply refund my money or send me the right item, as many companies would do in that situation, but when i asked, i just got more long, complaining emails, ending with ""no"". if you can find these inserts from another seller on amazon.com, i would suggest not bothering with these guys. they don't seem to have much of a sense of obligation to the customer. plastic wallet inserts aren't a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but i really hate when i (and my money) get used."
109592	if you wondered if this was made out of, it is good stuff;  and if you wondered if it would hold up for a long time?  then you will be pleased with this product.  it is about the right size, has good thickness of the plastic materials, but not so thick that you cannot see through it well.this is a good product and i would certainly buy it again now that i have it and have used it for a week or so.  enjoyupdate: now that i have used this product for about a month+ i am very pleased with it.  it is strong material as i mentioned before, and is easy to use.i will buy it again when i need more at a later date.  up to 5 stars all around quality.  gary
109660	did not fit properlywhat i don't like is being forced to type words i don't want to in order to rate a product.
109666	authentic nike dri-fit t-shirt. cool in summer, warm in winter, easy to wash, dries fast. a must-have item for any outdoor trip.
109678	these are garbage right out of the box. the material, like other people mentioned, is stiff and rough and essentially scrapes up your skin as you walk. they don't fit well either, the right shoe is uncomfortably tight, which is remarkable since my left foot is a size wider than my right.teva, you charge a premium for your shoes and i believe still use vietnamese communist slave labor for manufacturing, so you must have a large profit margin. stop with the shoddy workmanship and cheap uncomfortable materials that hurt the user and don't last.a little background history; i bought my first dozers in 2008 and they're among the best shoes i've ever owned and i wore them for over three years, probably 8 months a year until the plastic in the heel poked through. great shoes really. i bought another pair, a later version apparently, that weren't as good and started falling apart after a year. still comfortable though. i bought a pair of riva's to replace my second dozers, which lasted only a few months before being mutilated in the washing machine and these are the shoes i bought to replace the riva's.
109767	i was looking to replace a pair of 5-year old solomon techamphibians, size 10, which are a bit snug on me. so based on the reviews here, i ordered size 10.5 teva's and was really looking forward to making them my go-to summer shoes this year. well, they just arrived, and i slipped them on. within 5 minutes, my large toe started aching. it was pushed right up to the toe-edge of the shoe. i slipped them off and compared it to the same-size ecco's i purchased a few weeks ago. the teva's were smaller in length and width. also, i noticed there was no arch support. i even slipped on my solomon's to compare, and they felt better!i am disappointed in the quality of these shoes too. the fact that there is no tongue, means the shoe fits snugly around the foot, and you don't have the option to loosen and open it up, even when you loosen the bungee cord. the inside around the heel and under the tongue area has a stretch nylon fabric that feels cheap. the heel collapses, but is not hinged like the techamphibians, and is not comfortable. the fine mesh on the interior of the shoe should keep fine sand out of the shoe (assuming it doesn't enter around your ankle).these shoes were a good price on amazon, but now trying them, has cost me $6.00 for shipping. this is the second bad shoe experience i've had on amazon. next time, i'm just heading to the brick and mortar. gotta try 'em before you buy 'em.
109819	"these shoes are great! i wear them at the hospital and after being on my feet all day, i don't have any aches or pains. i typically get shin splints after walking for about 5 minutes and with these, i can go 12 hours and am fine. this is my second pair of fila brand. i have another brand i wear for every day shoes as well. i hope they never stop making these shoes!!they are comfortable, fit right out of the box and are true to size. i do not believe in ""breaking in"" new shoes and these feel like you've been wearing them forever the first time you put them on. p.s. the price is right too! no need to spend $100 on the other brands!"
109844	very impressed with the quality of this product purchased for a pre teen with much jewelry.  i would definitely purchase again.  great price for the quality.
109871	i neglected to read much, if any, of the previous reviews and ended up having to send these back. they were cute and just the right heel height i was looking for, however the sizing was way off. i ordered a 9.5, which is what i wear in all of my shoes. this one though kept flying off my feet! i was wearing pants the first time i decided to wear them so i decided to change into thicker socks because i really wanted to wear them, but i just couldn't get them to stay on. too bad.. really attractive and a great price but it doesn't matter when you can't wear them.
109903	my husband is very happy with the look and fit of these pants.  they are easy to get on and off for someone who is recovering from a back procedure and going to pt.  the length is perfect!
109931	i have some expensive special dark blue shoes that have some blue leather trim. the leather was looking faded. this stuff was easy to apply and has renewed my shoes.
109972	i had this scarf for no longer than a month or two, and it started to shred itself. it's very sheer fabric and cannot withstand much handling without tearing. i wouldn't suggest it if you want to wear it often.
109973	i made sure i brought it from trendblue after reading the reviews talking about the mix up and receiving pashmina scarfs instead from the other seller. mien arrived as described a viscose fringe scarf. i ordered the purple and it is a lovely color and quite dark. it is very soft and the perfect size big enough to give you some warmth yet small enough to look stylish. i am very happy with it especially for the price. i will ware this all year round. i use it mainly just around my neck, it can look elegant and sheek or more ruff and ready depending on how you use it.  its just the perfect size to do many things including a light weight shall for summer evenings. i will be getting some more.
109975	"i have been looking all over for a spring-weight red scarf.  the description read 100% viscose and the photo clearly shows a loose-weave, almost linen-looking scarf -- i was thrilled.  i just opened the package and was not thrilled to find a plain old ""pashmina"" style scarf like one can buy on the street for $5 bucks.  it even has the ""100% pashmina"" sticker on it.  this is not at all like the photo nor the description.  i would never have ordered a ""pashmina"" scarf for spring-- this scarf feels more like scratchy acrylic than viscose.  it's going back and i will need to continue my quest for the perfect red, spring-weight scarf!"
109990	i gave these out to my two girls and wife...great item...very strong..heavy...commercial grade..fully assembeled and loved by my girls and spouse
109992	keeps all of my bracelets and watches organized. i have lots of accessories, so this is a perfect addition. it also makes all of my jewelry look classy because of the black velvet. highly recommended. i could not imagine my life without this product now.
110003	i like this.  it really looks like what you would see at a boutique or in a classy department store.  the price was moderate/fair, but something cheaper would not be as nice or sturdy.  i have tons of bracelets and bangles so this helps me keep them organized while making them easily accessible.  it also adds a little flare to my dull room decor.  there is enough space between each tier and you can pit your watch or watches on the bottom.  i would highly recommend this if you have a lot of bracelets and you like to be classy! :)
110025	i bought these in x-large for my husband who wears size 14 shoe. the sale price was terrific... around five bucks.these socks are made very well so there are no complaints as to quality and they are comfy. pretty thick and cushiony with some reinforcement at the arch.they looked long and slim in the pack and i was worried they might not allow for his wide feet without stetching too thin, but they are actually great. they stretch enough to give a perfect fit, but are still pretty thick. i definitely got more than my money's worth with these. hubby says he really likes them and they do not ride down on the back of his ankle as he wears them. they fit like a glove.
110038	but these are the best socks i've ever worn. i love that they literally fit like a glove and just surround my feet.  they've kept my feet dry and sweat/smell free which no other sock can do! i'm especially happy with this since my shoes wont ruin quite as fast.
110096	the watch is just what they described and i like the bling around the face!  i have a hard time finding a watch to fit my slim wrist. i was able to cut the band and put another hole in it without it raveling or coming apart.
110098	i had been looking for this watch style for quite awhile.  the prices of watches, at the stores, ranged from $48 to $200.  i was a bit skeptical about purchasing an $8.00 watch, but after reading all the other reviews, i thought i would give it a chance.  i couldn't be happier with this purchase.  the watch is exactly as pictured and described.  it actually looks so much better than many i saw in the department stores.  i have a small wrist, but it was no problem to trim/cut the band to better suit my wrist.  it looks great!  i was so amazed that a nice looking watch could be purchased at such a low price... plus the shipping charges can't be beat.  i paid $10.94 inclusive of shipping... what a fantastic buy.  i am now going to order this watch in a couple more different colors!
110121	it works and it's pretty. what more can you ask of a watch.
110156	my daughter just got this a week ago this watch is amazing it glitter she calls it her bling-bling and you don't even have to wind it up beautiful watch
110207	the shoes served the purpose, looks like a very nice casual/dressy shoe.  the comfort is something to brag on.  i bought them for my husband which is mostly a casual attire person.  he love them.  they look like really expensive shoes.  the cost was superb.
110264	i rate this product 5 stars.  it is very lightweight.  you hardly know you're wearing them.  the company included backs for these earring.  i have gotten compliments for these earrings.
110270	bought this on a whim and it is so cute!! i have worn it a few times already and always get compliments. it is a nice pair for girls who like good earrings. beware, i don't have especially sensitive ears, but if i wear it for an entire day i think i do get a mild reaction to them, so people who are sensitive to cheap metal, i wouldn't get these.
110293	i have a pair of cole hana wedge that a love so much, so when i saw these on sale on jumped on them. unfortunately, theses are not true to size. my usual size 7 turned out to be two fingers too long, so they had to go back...
110356	i'm no small runner, coming in at just under 210 lbs plus i use orthotics and have a wide foot. all that said, i can't just toss on any pair of running shoes and go. these provide excellent heel cushion, but more importantly excellent midfoot cushion (where my step lands). compared to the mr769's i just retired, these feel like they will stand the test of time better while still providing a soft ride.for those of your using orthotic inserts, these accomodate powerstep pinnacle maxx inserts with no problem or over-correction.
110431	not worth $72.  i'm returning.  amazon says that the shoe is made from leather; not what it says on the tongue of the shoe.  at any rate, not comfortable.  this pair is going back.
110518	these shoes fit well and are very reasonably priced.  i have worn them for several months now, and they are holding up well.for the money, i think they are a really good deal.
110522	i've worn mostly new balance cross trainers for the past several years.  this most recent pair was tighter than my previous pair of the same size and was not comfortable to wear or walk in; didn't feel much cushioning at all.  it seems as though the quality of new balance shoes has been deteriorating recently.  i opened a brand new box of asics gel cross trainers that i ordered a few days ago and put them on; it was like night and day.  the asics cross trainers were super comfortable and had very good cushioning while walking or jogging.  i will be switching to asics shoes, which is too bad because nb used to have good quality shoes.
110524	purchased this and the mx623. this shoe ran tight and was uncomfortable. sole felt weak. i think the mx623 is a better shoe and rated that one 4 stars.
110560	"i grew up polishing my dad's workshoes and earned lots of extra spending money, but it was not until i joined the army that i really learned how to put a truly glossy shine on my boots.  i always thought that if i learned no other skill or trade in the military, at least i could be a darn good shoe shiner. i feel a little disloyal ;-) admitting to liking lincoln shoe polish since it was the marine corps approved brand and the tacitly ""approved"" shoe polishing product for the u.s. army was kiwi.  but at guard mount and honour guard inspections, the mps with sharpest looking uniforms (and best boots), and thereby earning extra privileges, were consistently those who had switched to lincoln.  and so began my association with lincoln shoe polish.i don't know the chemistry behind it, but lincoln clearly has a softer texture (more emollients?) right out of the can, and so the wax seems to penetrate into the micro pores of the leather better.  then when it is mixed and swirled around with a soft, wet cotton ball it seems to spread out in a nice even layer, much more like a cream polish (no lumping, and less swirl lines) and with far, far less effort, you start to see that glassy reflective surface which is the goal.  all that is needed after that is a quick, feather light (not pressing hard) buffing with a soft, lint-free cloth (micro-fiber is best).if that weren't enough, lincoln also has a superior dye stain ingredient.  once worked into the leather, it is tenaciously colour fast doesn't seem to readily rub off or transfer.  exposure to air seems to ""cure"" it, bonding the colouring component to the leather.i know it's just a small thing, but i also happen to like the snap open can on lincoln, rather than that twist key system on kiwi that sometimes breaks off.one last thing, not only is lincoln made in the u.s., but i discovered that i grew up just blocks away from the actual factory off of kifer road in sunnyvale, california.  so it is my hometown brand."
110594	i got this robe for my husband for christmas. he wanted a lightweight robe that came below his knees, in a comfortable fabric. this robe fits the bill on all three counts. he wears it every night. he would normally take a medium, but one of the other reviewers kindly mentioned this robe runs small, so i got a large/x-large, and it fits him very well.
110625	to be honest, this is the first pair of leggings i have tried, but that is because i didn't think leggings would have enough support for me. these cost more, but they definitely hold me in and are very comfortable. i'm 5'8&#34; and weigh 180, so i needed strong leggings.
110662	this watch was a great price for all it does. i love that's it's small on my arm beause i'm not to big. i love the tide chart when i found out how to use it because i live near the water.  i'm not so happy about the light but like i said the price was good. it's easy to use if you follow the instructions but there a little confusing especially with the tide and moon graph. but overall worth the money:-)
110689	"this was probably a great watch 4-5 years ago but not anymore...*the light ""pales"" in comparison to the timex indiglo. also, the light does not stay on when switching modes like the timex ironman does*the alarm sound is weak and doesn't have a snooze function*some of the info on the face is hard to see, esp. the solar charge bank*mine doesn't seem to synch very easily with the atomic clock so i just set it myselfi have a few other minor complaints as well. two things i like about the watch is that is was pretty cheap and it's much smaller than many of the most modern casio watches.i think i'll stick with the timex shock ironman!"
110707	i bought this watch after having owned the same in blackcasio women's lws200h-1acf solar runners 120-lap black digital sport watchso i knew the functionality which is great. the color is however quite dull and does not look as exciting.
110737	my mother in law loves clarks shoes; however, she won't pay the suggested retail price for them. i found these and they were exactly what she wanted. they provide a good arch support.
110743	these shoes are not just pretty looking, they are also comfortable and true to size. it seems with all clarks shoes, they are well made. i always find these shoes to be worth the few extra dollars i have to pay for them. i was a nurse, my feet are tired from constantly being on them. these feel like slippers when i slide into them.
110744	these sandals not only look good, and can be worn with dressy or casual clothes, but they are super comfortable.  the sandals have great support and cushioning for your feet.  well worth the cost.
110780	received my casio gx56 the other day. haven't taken it off since it came out of the can. love this watch! it's bigger than i thought but it is totally cool!
110792	solar function works very well and keeps great time. the temperature feature is marginal but every other feature works well and i have not had an opportunity to test it in extreme conditions it appears to be very functional. the band being a combination of leather and cloth is an improvement over rubber.
110833	almost gave up summer vacation due to plantar fasciitis but these shoes helped a great deal.  i still added another layer of soft cushioning (dr. scholl's) and it did the trick.  very hot summer days, walking on blistering concrete at amusement parks could have caused more pain but these shoes saved the day.  the shape of this shoe provides the needed support.
110857	"these have around a 3"" heel yet they are really comfortable.  i purchased them a 1/2 size larger and put insoles in for even greater comfort.  i was concerned that they would look cheap, but since i wear them with bootcut and wide leg pants, they look fine.  i was worried about the fit, given people's complaint that there is no zipper.  i have a very narrow heel, but since i inserted an insole, i have no problems with slippage.  the only negative is i wish they were quieter but maybe i can put rubber on the heels to take care of that.  if you want to stock up on booties before next year while the prices are low, don't hesitate.  i paid $79  for a similar pair  (from another brand) that i don't wear as much because these are so much more comfortable."
110961	my husband has worn the traditional docker's braided belt daily to work for years. the belts only last about a year, because the belt is braided all the way around. he tried this new belt, which is the same except for the solid leather in front. he said it was too stretchy.
111030	this was a christmas gift for my hubby, he needed a new belt and is very picky about how the leather looks and feels.  this one was a hit! the leather is supple and not shiny, and the double stitched edges lend a little extra style. the color is a rich brown and the buckle is not a bright silver color.  the fit is just what he wanted.
111092	very nice wallet, soft leather and a good amount of storage for a fairly small to medium sized wallet. it has a spot for your drivers license and i put a couple things behind it as well. i use all nine credit card slots for memberships etc., and there is plenty of room and the wallet does not get bulky. if you have tones of credit cards its not the wallet for you but if you have just a few then its perfect.
111108	i ordered these shoes in the blue patent and all i can say is i wish i had this shoe in every color. i did have to order 1/2 size up because cd shoes usually run a little small for me. i normally wear a 7 shoe.
111175	these were tight, & i'm tiny. i'm only 4'10&#34; & 100lbs. they are very high-waisted, but feel like they may cut off circulation to your lower body at the waist band. i used em for a bit, but eventually upgraded to something better.
111238	love it!  when it arrived, i thought it'd be rough and tough from packaging and mailing.  instead it came out soft and comfy!  great product to wear underneath tops, which is why i purchased it.  never purchased from elance before but will definitely purchase from them again.
111296	super comfy!  i have planters fasciitis and these shoes are spongy and cushiony.  i am usually a size 10 or 11 and the 11 fit perfect.
111342	perfect for belly dancing or zumba party! silky soft on your wrists and the coins dangle just the right length - no problems holding zumba toning maracas or with clapping.
111360	shirt fits great, long enough to cover arms, neck, and butt and it keeps me warm in afghanistan.  i can maneuver and shirt moves with me and doesn't get in the way like a bigger bulkier shirt would do.  love it.
111368	i am on the larger side of  a woman, i am xl or xxl in all that i wear. i often feel self conscious of what i look like.when i put this dress on i feel great, it is very flattering. it accentuates the bust and not the stomach or fatty parts of the body. very good choice and i have bought three more.
111376	the quality of calvin klein fabrics are way better than others and for this price you can not go wrong.
111389	i am an athletically built 183 cm 80 kg guy.these were too large for me, and also, i was surprised at the thin-ness of the material.these were kind of like a nightshirt on me, when i wanted a more snug-fit.would recommend anyone who wants a more flattering fit buy a size down.in short, i prefer the jockey t-shirts.
111390	and they aren't as long as i'd hoped...i'm 6'1/210lbs/44-46 inch chest. these are definitely a huge step up from hanes or fruit of the loom...but they could be better. the fit is inconsistent...some shirts are great, some are awkward - short/wide. ymmv. considering they are under shirts, some of the items i list don't really matter, which is why i gave it 4 stars. if they could be worn as a normal shirt too when needed, it'd be a 5...but they just don't quite fit like a normal slim fit shirt does.
111435	this shower robe is amazing and does the job .. very nice and it's color is wow,! my husband like it and i had one but please be aware it runs smll so order a size bigger!
111489	crotchless panties is the new thing. i love these panties that i had to get another one in a different color. the butterfly adds to the sex design of having everything visible to your partner. when i put these on, i instantly feel sexy and ready for a night (or day) of fun!
111499	"i admit, when i opened the package and found it braided into a ""rope"", i thought, ""oh, no"".  but i untwisted it and it was this lovely, soft, cotton-feeling item.  the length was just right, the pattern fun, and the fringe a nice detail.  i'm glad i got it."
111515	"i bought these for $25 (cheap).  that said, they aren't the cheapest made boots i've bought.  they fit great and look great.  the only thing was that the soles were kind of slippery on the ground, but after some wear they seem better.  i have thicker calves and i can completely zip these without looking too tight.  i'm 5'2"" and they come right under the knee for size guide."
111536	i like them , but i was hoping they'd be a tiny thicker for more impact (wanted subtle but not boring). i am disappointed with the clasp, i've already lost one after about a month.
111555	i read quite a few of the reviews before ordering these because i didn't understand why the rating wasn't higher. i've had at least 10 pair of these teva dozers. i wear them so much that i wear them out. i love the new pair i just received. i waited a few weeks to write my review because i thought perhaps the fit would be off or some other problem based on the reviews on amazon.i wear an 8 1/2 and am probably more of an 8 1/4 in my right foot. my feet are flat and they tend to be hot. these athletic shoes are fully vented and keep my feet nice and cool even on a hot day. i always wear socks with them; but that's just a personal choice. i suppose you could wear them without socks just as comfortably.they did make some changes to the styling but i find them just as comfortable as previous versions and i also find them true to size. i wear a us 8.5; i ordered a us 8.5 and they fit perfectly. if anything, i think they've actually managed to improve them somewhat as i feel i am getting more support and a little snugger fit which helps to hold my foot in a proper position.i love these shoes. i will keep wearing them almost daily for as long as they make them. i especially like the raven color as it is a good, dark neutral color.i work out, shop, hike and run errands in these shoes. i'd rather have them on in the house than go barefoot for the support they provide. thanks teva for another worthy generation of dozers.
111557	i got these to replace my worn out dozer ii sandals and was absolutely horrified.  these things are plastic garbage in comparison.  they hurt, caused blisters and are cheap in every way. i chucked them into the donate bin within three days. i do not know what is going on with teva, but i will not buy their products again.
111624	these sandals are very comfortable. i got 'em wet yesterday and they feel good even then. they don't get slippery like some water sandals can. i usually wear a size 9, but after reading some reviews decided to go down a size, and they fit perfectly. highly recommend.
111645	if you are ordering this shoe in the displayed color as shown i hope you get it! i have ordered two of them and they both came in brown not the color shown. i did keep the first pair i have because they are comfortable and i like them so i ordered another pair hoping they would be in the color shown and they were not. just goes to show ya sometimes the colors don't always match. if any has ordered the color shown please let me know:)
111709	"based on earlier reviews i ordered a large. i am 5'4"" on a good day and average build. when i put this on the crotch was hanging to my kness (no joke!) and the legs were about a foot too long.  i plan on washing this in hot water and trying to shrink it.  i'm okay with the legs being too long because i can fold my feet into the extra fabric to keep them warm but holy cow..."
111711	"this hanes camo thermal union suit was a little scratchy and somewhat loose when it first arrived but improved after the first washing and became just about perfect after the third washing. the material is good quality and i love the camo pattern. this has buttons going up the front and a ""hole"" with overlapping fabric (to prevent ""drafts"") in the rear.i hate being cold, which is unfortunate because we live on mountain in pa, and i have pretty much decided to live in this union suit for the remainder of the winter. my wife says it is the least attractive thing she has ever seen me wear, but it keeps me very warm and that really is my biggest concern!recommended!cfh"
111730	i've been wearing this brand for years. jms has very poor quality control when it comes to sizes. i had recently ordered a pack that fit perfectly and a size up just in case. the size up was way too large so i packed them away because i had washed them already. i ordered my most recent pack holding them up to an unwashed pair of the previously ordered ones in the same size they were fully 2 inches smaller at the waist. i've had this happen before with these panties as well. i used to buy them at walmart and ran into the same issue there and i thought buying them online may result in better quality control on sizes but i guess now. i wish jms would get their size quality control under some control because it's a crap shoot every time i get a pack of panties if they will fit or not.
111738	if you have more than one girl, these are great socks.  not only are they soft and comfy, but they have the sizes clearly marked on the bottom.  i never have to guess who's socks i'm folding.  my 3 year old can get these on an off by herself.  she loves &#34;hiding&#34; the image on the sock by not folding it over.
111744	these are the best socks for my daughter. most socks shrink after a couple runs through the washer & dryer but these stay the same size. also the material is thick so her shoes don't rub on her ankles, plus i can unroll them for her boots.
111768	these were a great deal for nikes and have the level of comfort and performance i expect from nike. added bonus: pop of color with the laces.
111787	the bra doesn't have much support for larger sized ladies, and the band is smaller than marked. i'll be returning for an exchange.
111799	they are comfy, and they stay put.  i love these socks for my 2 year old, and i would highly recommend them to anyone.
111802	we went through a few brands before hanes and these are definitely my favorite. they stay on my sons feet perfectly and don't fall off like other brands. love, love, love.although, i thought i was getting the white ones pictured and i got varied colors. its not a big deal to me, so i didn't mind.
111833	we bought this for last year and it lasted the entire summer. i plan on buying this exact shirt again. my son never got sunburned while wearing it and he never tried taking it off either.
111864	i have tarsal tunnel syndrome & wear orthotics in my shoes.  i have joined a gym which offers water aerobics & other water exercises & wanted a shoe other than a flimsy water shoe.  my first class is december 3rd, 2012, so i went to 2 local big box sporting goods stores.  the clerk in the shoe department at sports authority said the only option at this time of year is the water shoe.  i went to dicks, and the sales clerk said they didn't have any in the store.  he told me the water shoe would not give me the support i needed.  he told me to check on-line and not to let anyone talk me into getting a sneaker & wearing it in the water.  he named a several brands who make shoes designed to wear in the water for things like water aerobics.  i was delighted when i saw these on amazon.  one of the reviewer said they tend to run small, i normally wear a size 8 or 8.5 shoe.  i was going to order a 9 until i saw that review.  they arrived today & wow the size 8 fits me perfectly.  they are so lightweight and cute i really can't wait until my class on monday!  a friend who is taking the same class is going to be green with envy.  lol
111889	these bra tops are very soft and non-binding.  it is just the thing for comfort at home after a long day.  they don't give you much shape, so it is not designed for wearing under your street wear.
111891	these are so comfortable you forget you have them on.  mine have held up beautifully (well over one year) and i use the washing machine and dryer.  they seem to be indestructible.
111909	this belt keeps my pants from falling down, and does so in an economical, but attractive, manner.  it's slim on width, but fat on value!  if you need a narrow leather belt, and don't want to break the bank, i think you'll be pleased with the ctm women's skinny leather belt.
111918	now let me explain a couple of things here first: 1, i do not run unless i am being chased 2: i am not an avid exercise feind 3: these shoes are my work shoes and i am a nurse therefor i do not have any heavy duty usage out of these. i only asked for a couple of things i don't want them to feel like bricks on my feet and i want to be able to wear them for 8 hours without having my knees or feet feeling like i did a marathon (refer back to 1st comment). these are cheap (i like that) and they are easy on the feet. i usually don't change shoes very often so i like to have a pair i can depend on. these are very very good for the price, only complaint is no color at all, i mean none. white and grey, was the designer color blind?
111982	i usually wear new balance or saucony running shoes, but i was low on cash and desperate to find a shoe supportive enough but still inexpensive. oy, i've learned my lesson. i thought it might just be my flat feet & big size, but i found that my arches really were hurting soon after lacing these up. i've worn them several times and they've felt the same every time- very uncomfortable. i hope more wear will break them in, but i'm skeptical. i wear an 11w. i do have fibromyalgia & osteoarthritis in a few joints, but i don't normally experience any foot pain whatsoever. so i was surprised when my feet felt so fatigued & painful after just a short while in these (considering that they are running shoes, after all). but then my college professor- who's rail-thin, wears a medium (b) shoe, has a normal arch, teaches all kinds of fitness classes, has no disabilities & is 5'4&#34;- said the same thing independently of me about this brand. she mentioned that up until recently, she'd found that the avia brand was great, but that she'd had issues with the last couple of pairs from them being very uncomfortable. this is a woman who walks quickly and can wear even very high, thin stilettos without much issue, so i was surprised. so maybe it isn't my wide, flat feet after all! i think perhaps the brand has just gone downhill in quality. in any event, i will definitely not take my chance buying from this brand again.
111985	these shoes are low quality and poorly made.  i bought these shoes for zumba.  i do zumba 3-5 days a week. the shoes started falling apart after 3 month, literally.  the seems started coming off, and the shoes just fell apart.  additionally, the shoes have little side support, so they are not very stable during twist and turns. they did have good support, shile they lasted.  i will not buy these shoes again.  i will invest in a better shoe, even it means spending a little more.
112001	if you are looking for a great shoe/sneaker to do zumba in, these are perfect!  my frontline dance sneakers needed to be replaced and i tried these... i love them.
112037	this is my weakness.  tie dye anything.  i just love the bright colors and the quality of the fabric is great.  they are top quality items.  i could keep getting more and more of them.  maybe i will - i have a son and two son-in-laws to buy something for christmas.  the problem is they are hunters and fishermen.  maybe they can wear them to scare the deer off (i don't like for them to kill them).  it might attract the fish - maybe they will be able to catch more fish.great shirts.  the shipping was effortless  also.  it always is with amazon.com.  i have never had a problem with amazon - ever.  they have this ordering and shipping process down to a fine science. the better they are the more i buy.  help!! i am going to go broke (and with paypal forget it - i'm done for).
112043	i got this to replace a shirt i had bought at the state fair year ages ago that got ruined.  it's the same type of pattern and colors.  i really like it.
112104	i received 2 pink, 1 beige, 2 different shades of light purple, and 1 brown.  i was expecting 2 black, 1 brown, 1 pink, 1 beige, and 1 white.  if you buy these panties, you will get what ever color they want to send you, not necessary neutrals.  very disappointed. would have given the product a five star, if i got what i asked for.
112132	this bra is a full figured woman's sleeping dream.  it is soft and comfortable and doesn't roll or ride up while sleeping.
112312	i put these hoops in my second holes that were starting to close up. i wear them everyday and even sleep in them. because they are so small in diameter they can be turned while in your ears and never feel uncomfortable. they go with everything and have not caused any sensitivity, they've been in my ears for over 1 month! i'm very happy with this purchase. good price and speedy shipping.
112318	just what i was looking for, size was easy to gauge the way amazon displays it.  a nice basic gold hoop, not too heavy, not too light.  can be worn with everything.
112331	took a while but it was worth the weight, its heavy duty strong comes in its own stuff sack and its the real deal. plenty of attachment points and it works and wears well. took a while as it came usps from dublin ireland.
112351	last minute purchase i had to make for an event and i'm actually very impressed. first of all, the fitment was great, for the xl at least. i have a 46 inch chest and 36 inch waist, and i'm 6 feet tall... and it fit perfectly. for the price....you can't beat it. it was constructed well and again, for the price, its worth every penny.
112364	the veat itself looks very cheaply made and is thin material. the one i got doesn't fit at all so i have even trying to send it back but still haven't received any label.
112381	bought this for my mother for christmas.  it shipped quickly and i was happy about that.  the charm is very cute in person and looks great on her bracelet.
112470	if you wear dansko clogs all the time like i do you will love these shoes for warmer weather.  they are sporty and comfortable.  i love wearing them with capris.  so many people have come up to me to ask about them.  another thing i love about the volley clogs is that they come in so many colors so you can be casual or you can jazz up your look.
112534	first, yes they do work.i have saggy breasts that are very out-of-place for my age, being a teen. i got them from weight gain/loss over the years and neglecting to wear a proper bra, i suppose. i am a 38b.these do lift the breasts and i was very pleased. i wear them to look better in a bra, i couldn't see going bra less with these because of the jiggle and nipple show-through, but that's not what i bought these for. the only problem is you only get 10, then you gotta buy some more, and they come off in the shower because they are not really sticky. they also collect lint. i admit, i was impressed that when i wore them to bed, they were still in the correct place in the morning, and i do a lot of rolling around. i do not cut them at the cup size like you're supposed to, because i found them to be too small as it is. i wish the top part was bigger but oh well.i'd say the lift you get from these is moderate. i tried pulling it up higher but i guess the strain is too much on these because they are not very sticky. but they are very comfortable and you can't feel them. i think a stickyness more akin to boxing tape or 3m would've worked better, though maybe that would hurt too much to take off...
112601	i was hesitant to order this robe and usually spend close to but not quite this amount for a robe each season.  my other robe was completely worn out and needed another for end of season.  this robe exceeded my expectations of what i would receive.  very soft and plush.  a bit on the heavier side but fantastic for cold mornings.  extremely comfy, has been washed and came out of the wash with no problem.  a 5 star product.
112602	i got a 1x and i swear it is made for giants over 7 feet tall with a waist size of 100 inches.  why is it so big???  and the bottom hem was dirty when i got it.  i will say it is soft and the color is accurate and pretty.
112619	"yuck! these shoes are not bright clean cloud white like the photo...not at all.they are coffee cream, dark vanilla off-white --- and with a terrible yellow cast to boot!moving on... they are a little big in the toe and heel, but for me that'snot a bad thing.  (i wear 8 1/2 wide usually and i ordered a 39m - fits wellenough. (i don't wear thin socks).after years of dragging around in > no support &lt; keds... i had to get something better.clogs.  these are so heavy - but you don't notice that once they are out of yourhands and on your feet.  so that's fine.they do not feel squishy soft and bendy like sneakers do / should... but they onlylook like sneakers - don't be fooled, they walk like clogs.. but that's okay with metoo.comfort. very very very comfortable. due to the (almost and i'm not kiddingdonald duck disney) looking bulbous toe box (let's hope no one else notices)so........ the toes have much needed room - nodoubt that's why people love these...my toes love them too! but just don'tcall me daffy duck okay?the look.  major old folks home assistant, nursing student look here... nota sexy shoe, but since no one really looks at your shoes, you gotta go withcomfort...right?  okay... moving on...they feel solid and good.  like i'll have them a long time.the lift.  yes, they will make you about 1"" taller - if you like that, i happento like that.so this is my new replacement shoe for keds.  it's not country-clubby non-descriptlike keds...it's shreaks and i mean shreaks nurses shoe all over the place, i hopei can move past that ...ugh ugh ugh part... no i don't work for the hospital sorry......but i'll look past the weight (which you don't feel on your feet) the off white/badyellow creamy color that is not a bright white as shown in the photo and the i am nota nurse feeling... because>>>>>they are 100% comfortable.  honest.  i'm going to buy a pair in black now...uh maybe."
112662	not the quality i was expecting but it's good and the buckle is nice and its above the average i think.
112725	comfortable, fits nicely and not too bulky in size. very soft and comfy in the inside and hard wearing on the out. my dad loves it and is wearing it to almost everywhere.
112792	i am a small.  i ordered a small.  this falls off/down easily.  if they had an xs i would order again.  size down for this purchase and you will be happy.  material is nice and soft and flowy, just too darn big for me.
112844	this sweat pants is exactly what i expected... it is thinner than other brands, but it performs as good if not better!i wear it for morning walk or just around the house... it's super comfy and i've ordered a different color already!i'm 5'8&#34; with 33&#34; waist and medium size was perfect!
112937	the little plastic parts rub something raw and they would not give me my money back only an exchange for the same crappy shoes. don't use them!!
112989	these are the best shoes i ever bought for comfort, practicality and beauty.  the price seems reasonable too.  never thought i'd find a perfect shoe, but crocs makes them.  the original crocs seemed outright offensive in style, but now they make some cute, even lovely designs.  i've bought almost every color.  only problem is that you may find your crocs style but not your size on amazon.  i've been waiting for months for certain colors in size 6 but alas, still not available.  will wait some more because these shoes are worth it.  i like crocs so much that i even bought some of their stock!  that's called value investing.
113011	"i will admit, i have been a very vocal anti-croc sort of person. i thought the originals were ugly. when i first experienced my feet swelling to the point my shoes left marks, i searched high and low for something that would accommodate my feet, but that still looked decent enough to dress up a bit. i was skeptical at first, but when they arrived, they didn't scream ""crocs,"" and they stretched with my feet while offering cushion (unlike my flip flops). i just ordered another pair. these have been a lifesaver!!!"
113012	"i have purchased crocs for my child previously but i never considered getting them for myself.  i wanted a summer shoe that would be water/rain/puddle proof.  by this i mean that i don't care if my feet get wet, i just don't want my shoes ruined if i get caught in the rain in the middle of the day.  i love how super light these are perfect for traveling with and wearing with casual skirts and dresses instead of sneakers.  the rubber is soft and required no breaking in time for me. i have them in the brown and i think i will end up being one of those reviewers that soon realizes she has 26 pairs of crocs in assorted colors and styles.one major weird thing is the sizing on these.  i usually wear a 9 in regular sandals and ballet flats plus my foot is on the wider side but in this style i fit the 8. i can see some people being stuck in between 2 sizes and feeling like neither fits.  luckily this didn't happen to me!note about sizing on these crocs: amazon sells the medium width while the ones i got were the ""relaxed"" width. you can find those at the crocs store. like i mentioned i am usually a 9 in regular shoes but the 9m was too big in crocs for me 8m was too small but the 8w was perfect."
113036	i love crocs now that they have styles that aren't hideous like the original iteration. these are my third pair, and second in the kadee style. unfortunately my first pair wore down over time and my dog chewed up my first pair of kadees! this color was a great price at just under twenty, so i scooped them up. i'm so glad i did! i work on my feet all day and sometimes walking my dog late at night is taxing on my feet. these shoes are so comfortable, and the color is really fun!
113147	i read all the negative reviews and was a bit skeptical.  but i got one of these for christmas as a gift hovever, it was not bought from this site.  it was great.  it did not have the odor that the other reviewers mentioned and it holds all my stuff.  it fits most of the bags i use and makes it easy to transfer/change bags even in my larger bags it stays open and not fold in on itself.  i am so glad i got this.  best chirstmas gift ever.
113151	"this thong is so soft, comfortable, and truly seamless. i wore it for 40 minutes on the the eliptical trainer and then went straight to a 75 minute hot yoga class. when i took it off it was almost completely dry even though the pants i was wearing were still pretty damp. while it may seem weird to wear thongs as work-out underwear since they are oftentimes considered ""sexy"", if you're concerned about having your undies stay put, a thong is really the best way to go and this one definitely gets a thumbs up from me!"
113168	good looking, versatile, i got three of these in gold box deals and love them. danskos run small so be careful when ordering. very comfortable shoes.
113198	i bought these larger size pants because nothing is better during the winter holidays than big comfy lounge pants. these pants were so great that my wife had me purchase her a pair. they are soft, last great, wash well, and again are crazy comfortable.
113233	these are great fitting jeans even after washing...they just feel good. i would recommend them for the fit.i purchased black jeans and due to the fact that there is some polyester in the pants they gather lint from everywhere. (do not kneel on the floor to pet the dog) that is why i gave them four stars. just an irritation.[they fit around me well, but are still dragging on the ground. petites wouldn't have fit well around, have that problem with jeans a lot. there is not really a fix for being me having short legs. i will be shortening them. ;)]
113407	i love this suit! truly is sexy! i have 34dd cup size so my boobs are too big for it buti make it work. i have to pin the zipper closed. very sexy for a mom that wants to hide stuff.lol
113450	i love this dress. it is a very simple casual dress. the colors are mild and classy the fit is great.
113529	i ordered two of these necklaces: one for an everyday set to wear, and one as a gift. for the price i expected they'd likely be slightly different shapes or just irregular but really, they were a really decent quality for the price! they're very well matched in size, and they're smooth not irregular like i thought i'd probably get since they were so inexpensive. there's not a lot of luster to them hence the loss of a star, but that's forgivable overall since they're an otherwise nice to wear everyday set. i've actually received compliments. overall, a great necklace.****update: it is now nearly 1 1/2 years later and the necklace is still in great shape. what a great find!
113610	i ordered two for my 3mm sterling snake chain pandora-styled bracelet and they work perfectly. i am going to order a couple more, too, although i might get another pattern for variety. note- my bracelet does not have the screw-on bead saftey ends that other baed-charm bracelets have, so these are a must, otherwise i couldn't get the bracelet on/off without losing my beads.
113638	i bought the black pair in a size 9 and i wear a size 9 tennis shoe. the crocs fit fine, no overhanging toes or heel, and not too loose or wide. i usually try to find shoes that are a little bit wide because i have a morton's neuroma in my left foot and if a shoe is too narrow it causes excruciating pain. these sandals are the perfect width, just wide enough so there's no discomfort, but not so wide that it looks like a flipper. i tried wearing the strap on the back of my heel like a slingback sandal, but the strap kept slipping down. so now i'm wearing the strap over the top of my foot and the shoes stay on just fine. the straps across my toes were kind of snug at first, but after pulling on them and stretching them by hand they feel better. i usually have foot and heel pain if i wear sandals that don't have support and i'm limping by the end of the day, so i usually have to forego the sandals and just wear tennis shoes. i'm hoping these will be my sandals for the summer. so far so good (3 hours and counting). also, per someone's suggestion, if your crocs are a little too snug, put them in the dryer for 10-15 minutes (just long enough for the dryer to warm up and get the shoes semi warm) and then you can either stuff socks or something in them to stretch them out while they cool off or you can put socks on your feet and wear the sandals for about 30 minutes until they cool off and reshape. i tried this on another pair of crocs that i have and it worked like a charm. now i can wear them and they're comfortable. so i imagine you can do this with any type of crocs you buy. hope this review helps!
113718	"first of all, i love the shoe!!! it's got a lot of cushion and it's even comfortable on my right foot where i had bunion surgery a year ago. the only problem is after reading all the reviews, i ordered size 8m (i'm usually a 7 to 7.5), but received size 8w. the description states that it is 8m, but if you zoom the bottom of the shoe, you can see that the shoe says ""w"" for wide. it is too wide and a little too long also. i'm thinking about exchanging it for 7w. maybe it will fit better. otherwise, i love it!"
113732	i love the style and the fit but the heel strap will not stay up and that is very annoying to me.  i would buy more pairs of this style in different colors if it weren't for the the strap falling.
113750	the pants are perfect after a wash.  a bit large out of the box but a wash and dry and they fit perfectly.  i got a large knowing that they would tighten up.  a good price.
113780	these are the most comfortable sandal i own.  i have a ton of different types. but these are the only ones i got too!i will definitely be buying different colors when spring comes....i can always rely on amazon to have them for ms!
113794	got these for my girlfriend and she loves them. a nice small set of earrings that appear like they will last a long time.
113836	these are absolutely the most comfortable shoes i have, and since i have a standing workstation, i'm on my feet for a good 10 hours a day. i love that you can just spray them down and wipe them clean, as well. so why the 3 stars? because after almost exactly two months, one of the straps broke right at the fastener on the side of the shoe. this should not have happened - i expected better from crocs, really. so i took a chance and contacted amazon and they made it good - i had a new pair by the next day and the ones i had are on their way back to them.  these shoes are used under very ordinary circumstances - not even what i would call normal wear and tear - they get put on in the morning and taken off in the evening. i don't yank at the strap or do anything that should have caused something like this to happen. i am hoping to have better luck with this pair, and thanks, amazon, for stepping up to the plate and making it right. i'll re-do this review in a couple of months and see how this pair does. hopefully i can revise the three stars to five. so other than the strap issue, these are so easy on the feet, they almost feel like you don't have any shoes on! i definitely recommend them, but with reservations at this time.
113873	then these are the clogs for you! thought you had enough aches and pains after a 12.5 shift in the er running around all day and logging a few miles pushing gurneys to ct, mri & x-ray departments? back aches from bending over throwing in ng tubes, foleys & ivs all day? worn to a frazzle from that pesky expectation that you can divide yourself up and be in 5 places at once? well, your troubles are over with thses clogs! your feet will be in such abject pain by end of shift you'll not even notice that aching back, that hand that was cramping up from charting will scarcely be remembered. even that mind-numbing pain from a collegue accidentally rolling a wheelchair into your shin will now be a welcome distraction from your painful feet. in the name of fair and equitable product review one must look for a silver lining here and i think i've found it, after a couple of shifts in these clogs no matter how brutal you'll only recall the foot agony as you limp out to the car. as they feel comfortable enough walking around the house you'll not really get an idea until they have been worn to work by which time you really can't return them either. yes, they look comfortable and rather cute but, again, if you like pain these are the clogs for you!
113881	just received these crocs.  they will have to go back.  the really wide spacious toe is diminished in this style, somewhat. hoped they would be right because they don't have holes so drier for winter.  i love the light weight of crocs, and the price (not like keens, $$, which won't do for anything but hiking or walking--not dressy at all) but the wide toe, especially on the inner side (by big toe) is why i like crocs.  this pair is not as boxy as many clogs or crocs.  it looks more like a normal shoe, but i could not tell that from the pictures, although i tried.  i've had a surgery for a bunion and am attentive towards getting that wide toe area in a shoe.  also bought the shayna and it is much better, plus dressy.  the 10 is too big for my 9.5 size, but maybe it will shrink if i wash it.  i tied it on with a ribbon around the back strap, looping over the top of foot.  they stay on  that way and are very comfortable, with the wide toe. the top strap is loose.
113901	these socks are so cute and colorful. i gave them as a baby gift. they were a great gift for the price. i used them for the feet on the diaper caterpillar that i made. i would buy this product again.
113937	i really enjoy these shoes, they came to me quickly,i have had crocs before and if you wear a 1/2 size you might want to go back a size instead of going up to the next size. they are comfortable and look nice with shorts.
114085	if you wear the regular croc clogs i'm the one pointing and laughing at you, so i find it even more amusing that i actually own a pair of shoes from a company whom i thought was playing a sick joke on the world.i got the black ones. i was digging the green and purple, i just needed black and thought they were a good place to start. normally i wear an 8.5, the reviews here were super mixed, some saying size up (even crocs says size up) some say size down. i went down to an 8. i'm glad i did, they fit my foot perfect. i also have a super high arch and i was hoping it wouldn't be bothered by being braced in by the strap.i threw them on, because i had to get an opinion of own on these little feather light sandals and because i wasn't about to roll around town and have my feet aching after an hour...i felt like a super hero putting on his suit as the rubber snapped down on to the top of my foot. as soon as i stood up, they felt cushy. i likey.i wore them for a few hours working around my yard and home. the thong did begin to annoy me, only between my toes, after about two hours, but i think that's the way my foot is shaped and i believe it will stretch out. the other straps were absolutely fine and otherwise i didn't even feel them. they are super comfy.they're super cute and sexy because they're barely there, my hubbie dug them too (also someone who points and laughs at croc wearers). they are made of rubber however and at least the black ones do look like rubber, i don't think i would wear them for any type of dressy occasion. with shorts in the summer, heading to the beach, smacking around town, or even with a casual maxi dress though, i think they'll pair nicely. i love that i can hose them off if they get dirty - i hate cheap walmart flip flops and these are a totally upgrade/replacement for crap footwear.thumbs up to crocs.
114146	well i thought the material would be a bit better. looks a little like nothing for that price but the fit is great and the material is light great for the summer
114148	this was a christmas gift. the person who got this loves and she cant wait until i bu her another one.
114160	absolutely beautiful earring.  right size for me.  love it.  good earring to wear on special occasions.  it is definitely worth the money for this.
114178	let me start by saying that i have read other reviews about this and they were none to good, well i beg to differ, i really like this case, it is solid, has multiple attachements for molle and other and is nice and big inside to fit just about any sunglasses and accessories such as wiping towlettes and a wiping towel that usually comes with any sunglass purchase, so all in all, i would highly recommend this case to anyone looking for a replacement case or just for another case to put there sunglasses in. 5 stars.
114225	"i just bought this as a gift for my wife when she informed me that we are pregnant. she absolutely loves it, and it looks just like the picture. my only disappointment (and the reason i give it four stars) is that it is much smaller than i expected it to be. i haven't measured it, but i would guess the size to be about 1/2"" square. also, the chain is very thin, but that can easily be swapped out for a better chain."
114317	i bought these in bulk about 10 years ago at walmart and i am still wearing them. the socks fit well over my size 12 foot and since i have hairy legs,it does not rub up against or bind the leg hair. living in the south, i only wear these during the warm to hot months,they go with tenny shoes,dress and even sandals. they wash well and if taken good care of will last.
114339	these socks are comfortable and fit well. the stitching over the toes, which in some socks is bulky and can become annoying, is hardly noticeable here. quality is good for the price. i've got some socks which are 4 times more expensive and don't feel much different. the only reason i'm not giving 5 stars at this point is that i've just got them hence their durability is yet to be seen...
114425	received this ring today. it came within the delievery time frame. while i was surprised that it was only shipped in a bubble envelope and a baggy, no damage from being shipped from ny to alberta. love the look of this ring and definately not disappointed. topaz has great coloring and all stones appear well secured.
114451	i was hoping for more of a slouchy cap when i bought this. it is nice but very true to the beret style. it can be slouched a tiny bit but not as much as i would have liked. it is a nice hat though. the material is very soft.
114462	the tee fits great. the fit is longer and the fabric is very  comfortable. the fabric is a little thin, but it works great for working out.
114482	because of the high price for a 14kt gold chain,  i opted for the next best and am very pleased.  i needed a gold chain for a small locket and this necklace is perfect, delicate and well-made!  a wonderful purchase....  thank you, amazon!
114515	very surprized when the sandal said trotter. they are still great but not the brand i thought i was buying.
114525	these are a wonderful sandal ~ in fact i loved them so much i got the tan and black as well.  so comfortable and i love the fact you can adjust them to make them fit even better.
114601	i bought this for my boyfriend, he's not a crocs fan but i decide to bought them anyway, he loved them! he use them all the time because they don't look like crocs and he can walk all day long with them.actually after that even my dad ask me to bought this ones for him too. they both wear them all the time.
114602	i have a bad hip and even though i hate the croc look, i can't deny their comfort. these are the most 'normal' non-cartoon-feet looking shoes i've found. they are exactly what they claim and the best at what they do. and with jeans, they don't look like crocs.
114643	these are so great! good quality, color and selection. i think i got a deal that amazon was having because they were on $12 when i purchase..now $19. i would pay the $19 though. they are just so cute and if i have a friend that's gonna have a little girl...i would purchase these as a gift!
114666	i never had a pair of flats and decide to purchase the ballet flats in silver. i got a large which is like a 9, but realize they run a tad bit on the small side since these were made in another country where people's feet are smaller than american feet. i just didn't like to see my toe silhouette and they felt very uncomfortable when walking, my foot kept going into spasms. i though these would be great to wear once in a while, but i was wrong i gave these to salvation army.i wear 8.5 an a large is equal to a 9 and my toes still hit the end, an xl would be more like a 9 but having your toes silhouetted through the fabric, not cool.
114669	i bought these on a whim to wear at a house party of a friend who doesn't wear shoes in her home.  these are awesome! they are super comfortable and store nicely in my small purse.  since then, i've worn them several times and have even worn them while flying (so now they are outdoor slippers for me).  i plan to buy other colors.  they are thin and my feet were cold when i wore them once in february, but that doesn't take away from how much i like them.
114701	no words to explain how beautiful are this earrings! they really shines and the size is perfect. i bought it for my teen daghter. she love it!!!
114724	it's ok but the size is too large for a person without macrocephaly or prognathism. be careful when you order.
114745	i got some hankies from my parents many many years ago, and over the years they have become lost or worn or soiled etc.  so i finally went out and got these as replacements.  i'm very happy with them.  good size, softness, sturdiness, and relatively attractive.  can't ask for more.
114826	decided to stock up on flippy flops before summer, so i bought a few different pair... was originally concerned of buying these online since each fits and feels different on the foot... was pleased with the price and quality these keens offered.. highly recommended for purchase!
114831	i got these at the super low amazon sale price and i've been really getting into the keen line, so at this super special that amazon has on these i couldn't pass them up, just a win-win at this low pricing no matter what. they're about what i expected for a lower priced sandal but i figured they would probably be a bit better than your standard generic offerings for about the same price and i guess they're that but nothing to make your head spin or anything, i suppose a quick on and off if the occasion arises to hurry outside for something quick and whatnot, they do fit a little better than some other major brands i have in this low price range but again nothing to spectacular. these would probably be great for those with feet problems such as heels spurs and the like that find it hard and painful to walk barefooted on the floors when getting up at night, or a quick jaunt outside to collect the mail, etc., or greet someone that needs a really fast easy slip-on, as the sole has allot of cushioning. - overall good for the sale price and may hold much value for those in need, but again nothing to write home about, just a good basic inexpensive easy on/off flip/flop type sandal.
114843	to all who would read this. socks are not meant to be worn with sandals. it looks ridiculous and no it doesn't matter what color the socks are or how hot you think you look. if you are dead set on this idea then go all the way and get the long plaid shorts, the black above the calf socks and lets not forget the wife beater that is obviously to small for you to complete the picture. keens are awesome and if you are going to wear socks with sandals then wear the cheap knock offs.
114859	these shoes are perfect to wear in hot climates or when walking/hiking a lot.  first pair i bought to go out west on vacation in may - lots of hiking. i have other keen shoes for water that have open areas that i wear everywhere for the comfort factor (heat/support), so i bought this keen style to keep out the small rocks, etc. while hiking.  they did not fail me.  no blisters, very light weight & breathable.  if you have trouble wearing the heavy, hot hiking boots like me, then this may be an alternative for you.  i also have a wide ball and narrow heel & keen shoes keep my ankles/heels secure. i didn't carry a heavy pack hiking at grand canyon, canyon dechelly or yosemite, so cannot comment on how they hold up under significant weight for long periods of hiking.  but i did carry a light day pack (~10 pounds) and my feet were fine. i wear thin defeet socks with these shoes as with all my sports shoes. i just recently bought this second pair as a back up for a better price here on amazon.
114922	my wife says these are very true to size, unlike others (different brand) she has purchased in the past..she actually had to return the first 2 pair because of this fact..if you wear a 7, buy a 7.  these are comfortable and well built
114930	these are the best &#34;real&#34; summer sandal for kids.  yes i buy plenty of flip flops for my daughter, but when we need a walking sandal and a swim shoe, these are the real deal.  i have now bought them 2 years in a row for her (she wore them every day in hawaii when we were there, every day in florida, etc).  i will be buying them again for this summer.  she doesn't even know it's a new pair every year ;)
115104	"i did not like the style and returned these shoes. the quality seemed fine and the fit was good...however, the rocker sole is odd and uncomfortable. as you ""roll"" through your stride, at some point, the entire weight of your body is resting on a precarious inch of wobbly foam. this is not some anatomical breakthrough...instead, it strikes me as a faddish response to the need for shoes."
115122	i use this on all types of shoes (suade and regular leather), boots, and fabric's. it is a very good value, fast shipping, and works great. 12 ounces is great, too. i bought 6 cans for our outdoor patio chairs. i think, though this states for boots, it is the same ingredient for anything and just sells with the 'boot' name for those needing boot protection; like 'extra strength excedrin' has the identical ingredients for 'excedrin migraine' yet it is less expensive. 'nano' particals has become a sells term like putting 'organic' on everything, because it sells; remember 'no fat' on lettuce? they just lable it differently for peoples specific needs and gullibility. i recommend, will buy again, and i hope this helps someone.
115127	i spray this stuff all over my bearpaw suede boots, with two layers after 4 hours as instructed. even in the winter with the snow we've had, nothing gets through my boots, and no snow or water sticks! everything slides right off like it should with this silicon spray. i have not ha any stains, or weird marks from using this on my boots. plus, you get a lot in the one 12 oz for cheap! i will be buying this from now on!!
115184	in theory this is a great bag, particularly because it has a smaller component that can be detached from the &#34;mother ship;&#34; there are several pockets and dividers; and one can roll the bag or carry it with straps or by its handle. unfortunately, the modular construction makes the main component a bit too small to hold a full set of clothes plus shoes, and the smaller component is not large enough to hold everything i would want to take on a day hike or a walk around a new city.if it were just a bit larger i would have kept it and i still keep hoping to find a slightly larger version.
115198	i have washed this shirt a few times now. i think it fits great. it looks great. the shipping was fast. easy shopping all the way around. and you can't beat the price.
115232	i'm 5ft4 and 125 lbs, and i purchased a size small. i found these pants to be a little bit long for my legs. i do not think i have short legs per se. i do not love the cloth these are made of, either. it feels a bit cheap; kind of like scuba material. i do not wear these pants very often because of the length.
115237	i own at least three pairs of these and wear them to the gym all of the time for classes in zumba, yoga, and body sculpting. i can move freely and they never ride up or slide down. they are comfortable in every way. they wash well and hold their shape the petite size has a 30 inch inseam and my inseam is 28 inches. in other pants those 2 inches don't make a difference since i can wear taller shoes, but since i wear these to the gym, i had them shortened so i wouldn't trip on them. it costs about $10 a pair to have them hemmed at my local cleaners, but i think it is worth it since they are high quality pants and i intend to wear them for a long time. i do wish the manufacturer would offer them in shorter lengths. still, for comfort and overall fit, i recommend them highly.
115243	these shorts are light weight and comfortable. i use them primarily for lounging or sleeping.they are also good cover ups for bathing suits. i prefer a heavier weight with pockets for other activities.
115245	i read the reviews and ordered down a size but they are still pretty large.  the fabric is fine but the legs are so big.  i like the waist band and that was why i ordered them but the rest isn't great and i will wear them in the house this summer but they are far from being a favorite.
115284	i got these a few months ago and have worn them less than 10 times, maybe even less than 5. they fit perfectly and are really comfy, so there's no problem there! however, i pulled them out of the wash a week ago and the seam at the crotch had started to come out, leaving me with a giant hole right there! they're fixable, but i did not wear them enough to cause that! one star off for the inconvenience.
115290	i bought these based on the high reviews and the affordable price. they were completely disappointing. they were too big/loose but too short. i did read the other reviews and they mentioned the length being ok. i'm 5'9 and they barely covered my knees. they aren't sheer so no worries about bending over. the material is really thin and doesn't hide any bumps. don't waste your time or money on these.
115497	everything about these boots is great but there is a design flaw that makes them unwearable.  on the back of the boot, above the heel, is this plastic piece that is sewn into the boot (to keep the heel structure) that digs into your ankle every time you take a step. just wearing them around the house for a couple of minutes left red welts. sadly they are going back.
115548	bought this uniform pant for my 8 year old daughter. the pants washes very well and the size fit her perfectly. very cute fit, not too &#34;skinny&#34;.
115600	another pair of crocs bought for my nephew.  i liked the thong slipper coupled with the toe bumper to protect my nephews toes while playing outside.
115638	absolutely perfect.  light-weight knit goes perfectly with lands end super t shirts.  legs are slender cut and if you are not overweight, these pajamas are nice enough to wear outdoors.  fabric is super soft and very well made.  have the light grey and will order the darker grey when it is in stock.
115656	we purchased this to put all out travel documents and other important items when on vacation. i must say it hold a lot of stuff and did not look bulky. it is a great product.
115674	this is a very pretty watch but it didn't work. i thought of replacing the battery to see if that was the problem but felt that a new watch should not require an immediate replacement of the battery. i returned it.
115683	i give this patch a 3 star mainly because i thought my marine buddies would get a kick out of it. but i realized that it's insensitive to people of islamic faith. i cut it in half and discarded the english. i tell everyone else it means &#34;friend&#34;. i would not recommend this patch.
115717	i've always been a fan of saucony. i bought my son a different style in extra wide size, so was hesitant in buying standard size for him. when i got them, they fit and looked very stylish. granted, the velcro can't be pulled as tight and wished they were a little wider, but not every baby is blessed with two by fours for feet. i only have 4 stars because width (obviously), but disappointed that the difference in price between a 6 and a 7 size was a whopping $16 for that extra 1/4 inch ($24 and $40 respectively)!!
115751	this is such an adorable bag for any little girl.. it is so pretty i wish i had bought more. definitely 5 stars
115809	haven't really gotten to use the umbrella yet, but it is large and seems of good quality.  would work great at a weapon on the streets as well.
115816	i've got to say it- these fit-over glasses work great. having had eye problems for several years now, i have come to rely on sunglasses indoors and out.  of the many other brands of fit-overs i have tried, these have worked the best. they provide complete coverage, are light-weight, and actually fit over my glasses. they are pretty much the same thing as the post-cataract crowd gets from the doctor.  they might increase my dork-factor by 10, but the relief from the sun can't be beat. for stylish occasions i have a set of prescription sunglasses.
115865	these shoes are very light and comfortable: they feel almost like ballet slippers. clarks mary jane shoes are perfect for long walks and look good both with jeans and dresses, given one likes the style.
115922	got these for my 12 year old daughter.  the 5mm in silver is a great size.  they are very noticeable. the stone stands out from the silver. they are well worth the money.
115946	i was hoping that this would be more of a cute, casual summer coverup/ dress.  not so.  it is more like a big shapeless tee shirt.  it is ok comfortable, and i do really like the color.  it is fine as a sleep shirt or for hanging out on the porch or at the beach/ pool, but that's about it.  i'm not returning it, but i wouldn't buy it again.
115969	great shoe i am working through my pregnancy and my feet swell these are comfortable and roomy. great buy ..
115998	seems durable for a poncho.  i will update of how it held up after son returns from school camping trip.
116024	absolutely beautiful.  i love the detail on something so intricate and tiny.  the construction is not cheaply done, and the color is good.  the material is comfortable to wear !
116130	i am a lightweight woman with high arches who wears 7 narrow.was thrilled to find a shoe in my size -- though really wanted a  narrow cross-training shoe for aerobics class (which almost no brand makes in this size).so far, this model is not suitable for that purpose -- and is not yet fit for a general walking shoe.it has caused me some pain under the toe/ball area of my foot, as well as the outer side of my foot.  i am currently trying to wear this shoe for short periods -- hoping they will break in before they damage my delicate feet.might work okay for someone of average weight.
116132	this shoe is a great fit for women with narrow feet -- true fit for aa sizes.  the shoe appears well made and stylish.
116166	the clasp isn't as well made as i would like, but for the price, it is sufficient.  i would now suggest wearing very heavy pendants on this because i don't think the clasp would hold it without breaking.
116169	i got three of these (in 2012)  for my grandmother (in her late 80's) and she absolutely loves them!  a few things she usually looks for in a house coat, since she is only 5 feet tall:- good overall lengths, right in the mid-ankle. this garment is perfect for her. usually we have to alter most house coats, but not this one.- ease of getting on/off. even though this coat has a snap closure, my grandmother usually only snaps the few top clips and pulls it on or off. because the fit is not tight, it is quite comfortable for her.- the selves are a great fit for her frame. most other coats we tried were too loose in shoulders, or too tight in upper arm, or had too long of sleeves. this one is just perfect in all resects.- the fabric is not too thin, which gives at a nice feel and washes quite well.- they are just pretty to look at. the peach is especially nice and my gran's favorite.all and all, highly recommend.**** may 2014 update ******- my grandmother is still loving these housecoats. i find that they do fade out and start piling after about 2 years of weekly washings. seems like a pretty good milage to me!the older coats are still usable, but to freshen up the look, i'll be getting some new ones too.
116172	it's so nice to find a 100% cotton flannel robe -- soft, warm and comfortable.  just wish the sleeve cuffs were a bit bigger so they could be pushed up or rolled up.
116179	the size large barely fit my husband (shoe size 9).  they fit me better (shoe size 7 1/2) and they aren't available in size extra large.  also, the toes are fraying after only a few wearings/washings so that i actually thought i had them inside out at first.  i also wish they came up a little higher around the ankle.  they are non slip though.
116194	i have balance issues and my socks are slippery on my hardwood floors.  these socks help me tremendously!  no more falling for me.  the only problem is now that it is getting a little warmer out...they are a little too warm.
116403	i usually buy hunter's for my daughter and me, but this year i decided to give kamik a try...boy am i glad that i did. these boot are perfect for the wet damp weather during the early fall months and they are just as cute, if not cuter than the hunter rain boots.i first purchased a pair for my 10 year old son from piperlime based on reviews that i read, and then decided that i should give them a try for myself since i had completely destroyed my hunter's last year.  i will give an update after i wear them this weekend-supposed to rain all weekend here.  but so far, so good! very well constructed and they fit the same as the hunter's-so why not save a few bucks?
116414	lucky for me i do have a small head and these fit ok... i would not want them on too long because it starts to put pressure on my head.  as far as being polarized... i wore these to go fishing... and i could see through the glare on the water better with my own eyes than with these on.  i wish i would have just got the 5-6 buck ones at the sports store.  wont buy these again.
116425	this is the first pair of cycling shoes i have owned.  they work very well and definitely improve my performance on the bike.  however, they do not keep your feet warm on cold morning rides.  also, make sure the screws are very tight on the cleats.  if they come loose, it is extremely difficult to become unattached from the pedal - check the tightness of the screws frequently.and the size may run a slight bit below stated size.  not being used to the eu sizing, i ordered what it stated and they are a tad small.  they fit okay - but not enough room to double up on socks for the cold morning rides.
116538	received the set of three genuine lapis gemstone stretch beaded bracelets. color is a dark cobalt blue ( matches my kitchenaid mixer). the beads are a medium size, not too large and nicley round ( one reviewer stated their bracelet had a flat side to their beads). bracelets are very comfortable, the elastic doesn't pinch ( i have a medium size wrist). might be a little tight for a larger wrist.
116558	these have been the best cheap purchase ever made!i bought them specifically for walking the dog down to the mailbox in the winter, which means they get dirty, wet, muddy, etc. while throwing the ball, and then i can remove the tips for getting the key out of my pocket and into the mailbox.these work perfect for that.plus, they are super warm when you pull the tops over your fingers.i haven't had to wash them yet, but so far they have held up perfectly.i would highly recommend.
116611	i like this sneakers, pretty comfy.i will be looking out for more grasshoppers in the future. and i can wear it with or without socks.
116613	on the screen these keds look grey, but they are actually metallic silver. awesome. i get compliments whenever i wear them...and they're comfortable too.
116633	i wear a size 12 pants (or large-middle age suburban sprawl) and usually size 7 undies. got these in size 8 cause i can't stand anything that's too tight. no ride up. noe show through and sexy enough.
116862	for what it is and the low price it was sold at, this is an absolutely great wallet. even the box it comes in is leather(ish) but this will be a re-gift from me (yea, i'm that guy) because i sit at a desk these days at work and it's just too big for me once i put all of my stuff in it. granted very little of that is money but with a couple of credit cards, multiple id / driver licence, etc. and a tri-fold design, it closes up almost an inch thick. thaty is too much for me an i went with a bi-fold choice which has worked out much better. on the whole it is a great product, very good manufacture and if you can take sitting on it or store it somewhere besides your back pocket, you can't go wrong with this one. i recommed this product.
116955	it's tough buying shoes without trying them on as everyone knows.  for me these were just a bit sloppy around the ankle, and i need a little support for my arches.  also i've gotten away from trying to subject my toes to what is a not natural shape for a human foot, and they rebelled.  i should have known better.  they just didn't feel good to my feet.  in their defense, however, they are soft and would have looked good with jeans.
117030	great thing to have when needed. have used on every pair i have. suggest them for all.thank you, very much!
117047	just a wee bit too small tried to make it work because there was no larger size alas had to send it back.
117081	the padding keeps my nipples very discreet,even under white, thin, jersey material. i wear lots of tube tops and now i can wear while again.
117113	the pink bows are super cute. these aren't stretchy. i am a size 4 with a tummy. they fit. a little loose.
117116	i got these for my wife and she said the material is sheer but still very comfortable. i got a thumbs up from her on this present.  :)
117128	these are awesome.  i'm 5'8, 130lbs, i have no butt, and this makes me look like a have a bondonkadonk.  :)  the crotchless part is very seamless and it's not obvious that it's crotchless unless your put your hand right over your &#34;girl bits&#34;.  the garters are comfortable and long enough that you can wear them with stockings without it pulling your panties down.  i think this would be flattering on people with big butts as well as those with flat butts (like me).
117255	this is a great and comfortable shoe for around the house or off to shop.  great price on sale so ordered another pair for me and 2 for my daughter-in-law.
117364	great fedora for the price. i have a larger head and this is true to size. i ordered a l/xl, fits perfect and stylish.
117379	this thing helps me hide my man boobs(moobs) and stuff in some of that belly, i reccomend you get a size bigger! it is very tight, some people might not like that, but if you wanna look slimmer, you gotta make sacrifices
117381	i love this vest.. it does far more than it's suppose to... by compressing my abdominal it suppresses my appetite, and when i do eat i feel fuller quicker and longer.
117398	this item the actual bra seems to seve no purpose because it comes up and just rests there not really affording a lift which is what i think one will want after contour fit.
117458	i've been looking for of classic harness boots.  this style is perfect.  i prefer the rounded toe over the blunt/square toe.  they fit true to size and are comfortable.  they're a nice dark brown color, too.
117474	i wear 36dd. large is the correct size based on how it fit in general, but it barely contains my bust.
117483	"i actually purchased this a while ago, and am just now getting around to a review.  i bought an xl in fuschia and have been quite pleased.  jezebel sizing seems to run true, so the xl was a perfect fit for me (bust 40b, waist 36"", hips 41"").  i like the ties on the back (it also has a two-row hook-and-eye closure under the top tie).  i love the fact that it comes with a full panty instead of a simple g-string, and find that they fit me very well."
117523	these boots are very stylish and just the right color, but unfortunately, one of them felt like there was a nailhead or bulge coming through the insole @ the heal, making them terribly uncomfortable and completely unwearable. too bad, b/c they're otherwise very cute.
117531	this is a very comfortable and good looking sandal that i would highly recommend. i have worn these sandals many times so far this summer and they are great overall.
117551	i have plantar fasciitis and these really help. i definitely recommend!!! thank you so much superfeet for making an awesome insole.
117561	i think the green one are better.i bought the cooper praying for a much better feel.they made my feet feel funny in my shoes
117571	the fit, material & its bright colors are very good. waist has smooth elastic, the whole texture is very smooth. the colors look brighter & lively than its online pictures. the pants don't come off the feet like other brands and this is good for the crawling babies. i very much recommend these. great service as well.
117579	looks good and i like the quality, but the size is not 0-3. my girl is 3 m.o. now and still the pants are big on her.
117590	"i have a pink and tan set, and they just great. quality is good, the packaging makes a good gift. it is 0-6 months size but it can last longer (especially hat).my newborn baby girl had small head 13"", now 3 weeks later almost 14"" and the hat fits good (it sticks only on the top). it will stretch later and i suspect will fit also during next winter.the gloves are a bit tight around wrist, but that means she won;t loose them. although as baby grows i think that rubber band would be better.the socks/booties are cute and put it over the onsie with covered feet.the items are 100% acrylic, are soft and durable. can be machine washed."
117593	these tights are great! they hold up well through many many many wash/dry cycles, so far, have not piled- she has been wearing them about once a week for 3 months. size is spot on, very stretchy so these really will go the distance 9 -  18 months, possibly longer if your babe is on the small side. the bottom of the tights have no-skid  dots on them, so she can cruise around with out slipping, no shoes necessary!
117606	second pair of shoes i have bought from stacy adams - the square-toe shoes avoid the cramping of most slip-ons, without being a sloppy fit.
117663	i was looking for something to help my daughter's bunion condition.  i got this for her to try and she really likes it.  i don't know if it actually helps but the design of separating the toes seems to work logically.  one advice is that don't pull it too much as the thread on a couple of the &#34;separators&#34; come off easily and i need to re-sew them.
117700	the rest of the colors--black, blu, orange, pink are okay though.  white looks like an undershirt.  lavender somewhat thin as wll
117790	these don't fit any better than any of my regular hanes (or whatever walmart sells) undies.  the fabric is nice, but that's about it.  i was expecting them to be very comfortable.  not worth the extra cost, in my opinion.
117799	i like cotton underwear, but thought i would try these.  they don't even have a cotton insert!  yeah they dry fast, but what is the point if you are uncomfortable all day?
117817	"i lusted after these cute shoes for weeks and finally tried them on at a major department store.  they were comfortable on me, as i have wider feet with narrower heel & ankle.but two things kept me from buying (aside from a better price at amazon):l)ankle strap is double-thick due to the wrap around/loop back closure.  seems like it would dig into my skin.2)the actual width of the platform sole is really thin, making these pretty wobbly to  walk in.  check out the view from the bottom of the shoe to see what i mean. for me, part of the point of wedge shoes is the stability, but these feel more like stilettos.too bad, because they are not only cute and have nice cushioning, but the combination of a platform plus low (3"" or so) heel height means you get sophistication and sex appeal without a steep incline.  wobbling around would tend to ruin the effect though."
117823	take any outfit that you would wear nylons or leggings with, and put these babies on and....wow! catch a lot of guys checking my girlfriend out when she wears these.
118014	these pants are great. tru to size and the color is perfect. i went with the navy size 10 petitie because i am a little shorter (65 inches).
118022	these shorts arrived on time as per order details.  they are of a very good quality material and the color is a beautiful shade even better than as seen on the site.  these shorts fit very well and are well worth the price. i would order these again.
118053	"i wanted to have a hoodie with a slim fit to be part of an outfit and this one looked to be it in the quality i wanted. most of the reviews said they ran large so i ordered a medium instead of my usual large. even in medium (8/10) the arms are slim and plenty long (i am 5'7"" usual size 10/12 jean, 12 top) and the side panels look nice, it is long in the waist so it comes down well over your hips. it will work well over a t-shirt, under my leather jacket on the bike, and long enough to keep my end covered. get your regular size if you plan on wearing it with layers underneath and more as a top coat as the arms are also slim fitting like a junior fit.the fabric is thinner than most men's heavy athletic hoodies but is quite warm, more of a sueded micro-fleece finish to the lining, the hood is large and works well on a chilly,windy day without plastering your hair to your head. i hate to say i have not washed it yet, planning on cold water and low dryer hoping arm length does not shrink. the amazon size chart measurements are correct for hip, waist and chest. i will update if it shrinks.decided to update and let you all know it did not shrink washed in cold water and low heat dryer.it didn't fade either."
118102	this shirt is much larger than i thought it would be. i thought the size would work because of bust size, but this shirt is much too large. i figured i'd keep it in case someone i know needs the shirt or some other way to use it.
118108	i returned these.  they look well made and fit well (true to size), but for some reason i didn't like how they looked on.  i love everything cargo usually - but these just were not flattering.  seemed manly...
118124	i like these shoes.  they are cute and fit to size.  they are pretty comfortable and have left no marks on my feet after wearing.  they are a good summer shoe with dresses and skirts and would probably even look good with a cute pair of shorts.  i would recommend these to anyone looking for espadrille type shoes.
118158	these shoes are nicely styled and a gorgeous color (bright, almost-pink coral) but they are run small. i ordered my normal size 8. they fit well overall, but my toes were squished in the toe box (and 8s usually are too big for me!)i would suggest buying these a 1/2 size up. i'd also suggest ordering a 1/2 size up if you're planning on getting insoles, because these shoes aren't very comfortable and insoles won't fit in the shoe in your normal size.
118185	it is thicker than i thought it would be. it fits perfectly on me i'm 5'9 and 177lbs, that was like right below the cut off point for these...so if you're heavier than 178 and taller than 5'10 i wouldn't invest in them. but hey if you fit into the criteria don't pass these up. like with all stockings you have to put them on gently if you want it to last. it even says that on the package. it came really quickly too. i received it 2 days after my order :-) i am very pleased. the price was a bit steep but after feeling the fabric it well worth it, plus i'm sure it's also a bit pricey because stockings are in style at the moment lol.
118234	this robe is so soft and warm.  i love it.  the robe fits me with plenty of room left over - just the way i like it - i am 5'5&#34;.
118236	this robe is so roomy and comfy. i read a lot of reviews before deciding on this one.it does have some linty stuff that comes off and will stick to things like fleece initially, but stops after a couple washes & not near as bad as something like a cheap fuzzy robe from walmart which endlessly litters everything it touches. you can tell this is much higher quality.i'd definitely recommend this robe for anyone who loves something soft, warm and cozy. i got a l/xl, but could probably have gotten a m, but i wanted it big and roomy.also, i am 5'10&#34; and it comes down to just above my ankles (the picture doesn't look that way).
118259	what a beautiful ring this is.  i wear it often and am proud of the color of the stone and the unique addition of gold at the base of the amethyst is really a plus.  i have several amethyst pieces and wanted to match the shape of the stone and was pleased to find this on amazon.  the stone is substantial but not gaudy and i am very proud to wear it. the sizing (i bought a 7) is right on with other rings i own, so the jeweler is consistent with other jewelry pieces.  thanks amazon, you have a great selection!
118283	i was pleasantly surprise when i received these earrings. they're pretty and just the right size, even more beautiful than what is shown. (thanks to the reviews) i bought them to wear to a wedding and received lots of compliments.
118342	received this lovely piece of jewellery today & so very impressed with amazon with the super fast delivery of my order with matching earrings, as i live in western australia & only placed the order on 8th december & received it 5 days later on the 13th december, 2011.this is  a dainty/refined piece of jewellery, not overstated, very delicate & feminine. sits nicely around the neck.it is a little smaller (the pearls) than what is actually photographed on the jewellery site which is a close up of the necklace, the length is right.the best part was the price, i have watched this item for some time & slowly it has come down in price & feel very happy with my purchase.
118352	what can i say, it is a stunning ring. seems well built and pearl is beautiful. it comes w/out a case, it's in a little ring bag. but hey, for $25 (i opened an amazon account and got $30 off), it cannot be beat. and yes, those are real diamonds. just a very nice ring that my wife loves.
118373	i bought these for one of my sons, and his ex-wife had purchased something similar to this a few years ago and he loved them...
118433	this is my new favorite robe!  it's very soft, washes and drys well, fits great, and i love it!  the length is just above the knees, so it's not overly short and it's not overly long for hot summers.  love it! :)
118539	i was worried that a ceramic band watch would be too heavy; this has a niceweight- feels luxurious but very comfortable and after a couple of minutes idid not even notice that i had it on. the watch is gorgeous, white with rose goldcolor trim, it looks very elegant but not gaudy or over- decorated. fine for bothdaily and  dressy use. so far, after setting it with the cable news channel clock,it has kept perfect time. i particularly liked the fact that there is an extra link thatcan be removed if the bracelet is too long, without needing a trip to a jeweler.i can wear a 6 3/4 to 7 inch bracelet and this fits perfectly with the extra linkin place; a larger wrist might find it tight or need to get extra links. the only ( slight)negative is that it can be difficult to open the catch but i would rather have itthat way than so easy to open that i lose the watch.
118568	ordered for my wife. she  and i both loved it.  great quality and looks nice. arrived early. will order from this seller again.
118591	i bought this for my daughter because we are thinking of taking a vacation.  i think the material is good.
118632	it's a seiko - what else can i say ... made well, wears beautiful, (lots of compliments), outstanding finish and details and it's solar so no replacing batteries
118699	i wear a 38 g (was 36 ddd pre pregnancy), and have bought a variety of nursing bras.  compared to the other anita bras i have (the microfiber and the jaquard one), this is my least favorite.  it is very big and clunky.  i know i have a pretty huge cup size, but not every bra screams that.  the stretch microfiber anita nursing bra is just so much more comfortable and pretty.  this is not the bra i want my friends to see me wearing when we're having a baby play date and nursing together.  i know that sounds so superficial, but you want to feel pretty in a bra.  and not like a big ol' mamma ... even if you are a big ol' mama.other than that, it's functional.  it's just big and clunky without being particularly more supportive.
118710	this ring in size 10 ..i should have ordered a bigger size, but it was not available..anyhow my son is pleased as punch with it and can wear it on a chain.
118755	i have hard wood floors (which i hate) in my home. my feet were always aching, heels were out of this world in pain every single night. since i work from home, i had to look at the source of the problem. bare feet and hard floors. i started wearing orthaheels about a year ago, i have the inserts, shoes and this is my second pair of slippers. the fact is, our feet are not designed to walk on hard unyielding surfaces. these slippers are a godsend. some people may complain about the high arch support, but it's there for a reason and once your feet adjust to being supported, all the pain from years of no support goes away. i am thrilled to have found orthaheels.
118773	this shoes are great for the back, but be warned; slowly get used to it as it's purpose is to mold your feet into proper alignment and it can't do that without some pain.  so despite it's soft covering, underneath it's hard.  wear it a few hours a day, gradually moving toward all day.
118797	i went off of the reviews on amazon stating that this is junior sizing and to go up a size, so i went up two sizes because i was looking for a little more room. i was expecting it to look like the image posted here - slightly form fitting, with some shape to the shirt. i am not sure, but i think i received the wrong one. i got a humongous shirt that was so boxy, it would never resemble the shirt advertised. i returned it.
118800	i was a bit worried about the fit of this shirt, as i'm a busty lass, but it fits like a dream. the logo is perfect and doesn't stretch or show any cracking after two wears and washes. it's spectacular.  given that it's so hard to find decent super hero shirts for ladies, this one is well worth the money. added bonus: it's really soft!
118848	slippers are ok but they have a rip on the side!! i wish the us would make things like this. china stuff is poorly made!
118966	light and doesn't cause issues with my wrist.  and having the water-resistance helped me to pick this armitron unisex black watch
118981	the jersey is thin, the buttons look cheap, seams get easily broken, overall very cheap look. would not recommend it.
118984	i was hesitant to order this after some reviews stated it was too small. i've got a really large head, and this fit perfectly. there was actually a little room to spare, so they might have changed the design. the style of the hat is just adorable, very feminine without being overly so. i'm thrilled with purchase, and would buy again.
119007	this is of good quality and as described. it fitted me well but it made me look like a nurse. will try different design.
119042	very happy with my order.  the quality of the material is excellent.  the sizing guide was helpful as well, i went a size up on all my orders from doublju.
119050	there is no question that when it has came down to watches, seiko has always known how to make a great standard in timepieces. they have shown about all different grades from solar, to automatic. they are one company that show all boundaries for the dollar. that also has shown with the contemporary as well. this beautiful watch is a classy and contemporary quartz watch that looks great on any gentleman. from the contemporary and classy with business for the office, to the sporty and outgoing. i also like this one because it has a very easy to read stopwatch that doesn't feel as complex as other chronograph watches on the market do. the illumination on the hands doesn't feel bad either. it looks pretty good, that can even stand farther than other seiko's on the market. if you are looking for a great watch to step into with seiko, this is one you can simply start with.price: bsetup & comfort: b+overall: b 1/2+
119066	i don't like wearing regular shoes when i'm at home but going barefoot can be painful when going outside to get the newspaper (and stepping on small stones, etc) or bumping into walls when not paying attention.these moccasins are almost like being barefoot with all the pluses of a super comfortable house shoe. while i choose not to wear these &#34;out&#34; i could because they have a hard sole and look better than some of the shoes i've seen other women wearing.fit just a little bit snug at first but now are perfect.
119212	"sweatshirt material. wind will cut right through this jacket.i am 6'2"" and about 200lbs and got the largest size they have. barely fit with my wide chest. enjoyed it while it lasted.inside of jacket sheds onto any shirts worn beneath it (don't wear white if you got the black jacket). i washed it and let it dry and now the nice clean appeal of it is ruined and it is worse than my cheapest sweater after years of wear and tear.i like the brand of clothing (despite most of it not being meant for a guy my size) but i will be highly more skeptical in the future.all the cons being said, it was very nice (despite the popped collar and the studs on the shoulders attempting to appear punk-ish)"
119239	pay close attention to the sizing instructions, because they run small.  this is especially true for a fitted coat such as this.  i love the material and detailing.  it's warm without feeling bulky.  looks great, very classic with a modern twist.  shipping and handling are a little expensive which detracts from the great price.
119243	i only tried it on once for trial purposes and i can already tell that it will look good on me on top of my already very good looks! kidding aside, for reference i am 5'3 140 lbs and i got the korean(m)/us(s) and it fit me adequately! the sleeves are almost covering my hand but it really is no big deal for me. i prefer the jacket closed since it doesnt look as good opened as it is closed. when the jacket is opened it doesnt look like what it looks like in the manequinn preview maybe because i am just short, so most of the time i just close the lowest button pop out my scarf then bam ba da boom, you will look like a fashion model and everyone will be admiring your aesthetics. i have not tried it out in the very cold weather yet but i really do not care about that cause i rather be looking fashionable than be warm. i have a scarf to go with it anyways! hope this review helps! will buy again from seller!
119320	honestly i can't rate it.  have not used it yet.  i am hoping it will work when i start cleaning my jewelry.
119328	it fit perfectly and is sexy!  i am looking forward to wearing it on stage during a gig while playing my keyboards!
119356	i love this hat. i have kind of a big head so most hats don't fit me well but this one is stretchy and slouchy enough that you can't notice. it's warm too. i wouldn't say it'll handled the blazing cold in mid-winter, but it'll help. the main reason for this is because of the loose nit which was to be expected. i ordered the grey one and i couldn't see the bill through the nit and i  even tried to look at it. it only got 4 stars because of the loose nit but other than that i love it.
119429	bought it for her birthday.  she likes the light weight so that she can wear it inside and out.  inside it is fashionable, outside it is thick enough to keep the chill away.  great colors, cool design.  perfect for casual wear, but can also be worn with some dressier clothes.
119430	i thought the color combination of this scarf was gorgeous. these are beautifully made scarves, and they seem to be such popular fashion items these days.i love this scarf, but it`s really very hard to just pick out one!!
119441	size up x 2this thing runs very small. i'd have kept it if it would have run true to size. i think its a factory second due to the super small sizing.don't do it unless you size up x 2 sizes.
119443	this is a christmas gift so i don't know if she will like it or not -very nice. i'm sure she will!
119460	love these boots.  i am size 11m.  they are comfortable and don't really need break in time.  because i'm an eleven the ankle of the boot is kind of wide but good for tucking in pants.  the toe is rounded so i can easily wear them.  pointy toe is just too narrow for me.  i recommend buying at &#34;off btoadway&#34;. they have them significantly reduced to about $85.
119473	1st off, i'm a watch enthusiast (aka watch nut), i have about 20 watches in my collection.  several mechanical watches ranging from a tag heuer link chrono, aquaracer 300m, a tissot prc200, a bulova and two orients and a couple of invictas.  my quartz collection s a high end square faced citizen 3d eco drive. a accutron chrono, a pulsar chrono and a citizen gold dress watch.i love all of these watches and wear them all, but if i had to be deprived of my collection save for just one watch, i would make that choice this one.it can do anything i would need to ask out of a watch, it looks great, dress, casual, swimming etc. it's wr to 200m has a sapphire crystal, and is radio controlled (watch is accurate to the second every day) has perpetual date (never have to change the date window on odd numbered months). it also conveniently can change the time zones with the turn of the second hand. lastly it's an eco-drive and it never needs to have the battery replaced.i bought mine at kohls (authorized citizen dealer) for about $230 out the door after apply their store discount and an added 30% off coupon i had. that adds up to less the 1/10th of what i paid for each my two tags.
119480	my elderly mother has a variety of foot problems including bunions, bandaged sores on her toes and edema (swelling).  she needed extra-wide shoe with a lot of room in the toe box that were easy to put on and take off.  these fit the bill perfectly!  the velcro makes it a snap for her to put them on and take them off by herself.  there is plenty of room for her toes and we have been adjusting them to suit her changing needs by adding and removing the thin insoles and her orthotics.  (we bought the first pair at a specialty shoe shop, and she took 1/2 size larger than she measured, so it's possible the shoe runs short.)  she now has two pairs --- our favorite is the brown croc model is a beautiful reddish-brown-patent/black-fabric color combination that goes well with everything, including black clothes.  she gets lots of compliments on them which makes her very happy.  and i am really grateful to have found them.
119481	i had to return the shoes. the leather around the toes is very hard and feels extremely uncomfortable, the toes were very sore and therefore i could not walk. after reading all the reviews i thought these shoes were the ones i was looking for my sensitive feet and with many problems but it was the opposite. the shoes look nice, maybe the one that i got was not quite right.
119556	this is a really cute skirt! it looks really sexy on, and conforms to my curves, bought a m (i'm actually 5'7&#34; and wear a dress size 6) it fits well. i have to be modest at church, so it covers my knees, and still makes me look sexy.the belt is actually really cute too. i took it off the skirt and have worn it with several other outfits. :)
119569	i read the reviews on this and another skirt and i intend to follow the warnings of the back seam coming out. the skirt fits well, but i will reinforce the back center seam before taking this one out on the road.the fabric and style are quite nice for the cost. i am glad that i returned the skirt for a smaller one and gave it a second try. it was worth it. recommend it.
119612	i have had a really hard time finding flip flops that aren't crazy expensive, too narrow for my feet, or really really uncomfortable. i have a dozen flip flops that fall into that category. i love my rainbows but the women's rainbows are too narrow for me. i have tons of old navy flip flops that give me blisters because they're too narrow. i have a few payless ones that are cute but my feet hang off the sides.these are perfect. they are comfortable, soft, durable, and wide enough. the narrow straps are feminine and stylish. best of all, they are affordable!!
119666	when you put on this little black tee, you have casual elegance, wonderful relaxed coverage and cool comfort all at the same time. this is the third one i have purchased in a year. washes well, wears well, travels well, always reliable. looks great even if it had to be rolled up into a ball in a corner of the suitcase. and everything black - goes with anything. always formal, or always casual. perfect...
119694	it's very sleek in appearance, however, with limited instructions, you'll have to click around to figure out how to adjust the time and date.i purchased two watches a while ago, from different vendors and received a very large version of it, and a very thin and flimsy version. the clasps are hard to kick off with your nails, first time around. i still haven't figured out how to remove any of the links.the larger one today (about a year later) still functions, but the smaller one has lost buttons and is completely drained of its battery throughout the course of daily fray. i suggest reading comments carefully to understand what you're getting.both the watches i received had red led displays as listed.
119731	live out his csi miami dreams!  he was not going to leave me alone until he owned his very own pair.
119744	a christmas present for my daughter....she has two cats.  she loves the bracelet.  it is very well made, with a very solid clasp.  it does not seperate to add more charms, like many of these pandora type bracelets do.  so do not buy this thinking you can add to it.  i still think it is well worth it.  i did get it half price during the amazon december sales....so i really do think it is a great buy.
119770	i don't think the beading was attached well and the base looked as if it were going to come off. they were very pretty and fit well, but not worth the price.
119824	this is really a one size fits all. it fit great. i have large hips and a tiny top and i thought the panties would be cutting into my skin but it didn't and the top still fit well. it was the perfect gift.
119875	one star off for no arch support which the flat crocs do have some of.  hard to know whether to get a size down or up with crocs if you are a half size.  i sized up on these and that was the right call.  they feel a teensy bit tippy to me but i am not a heels person so i am sure i will get used to it.  definitely a fun sexy shoe with some cushion for walking around in.
119919	these are very nice earrings, and i get compliments on them all the time. they look very much as pictured. i would recommend them.
119967	i ordered these thinking they were silk???  that was stupid.  i was really disappointed.  they are very cheap looking out of the box.
119983	these pajamas are true to size, wash up nice, and are comfortable.  i would purchase these again.  the price was right.
120009	these are very nice looking gloves; my partner loves them. the leather and lining are both soft and very nice-looking. he says they are warm. the only minor complaint is that they are not very fitted--they almost look a little wide. they still fit and look good, and i would prefer that they be a little wide than too narrow! the xl worked well for someone with large hands.
120025	this bracelet has kept its color, has not faded, and was the perfect size for me. looks very good and shiny.
120058	these boots are so luxurious! just absolutely beautiful! easily better crafted than uggs, in my opinion. super comfortable, fits as expected, nice color.
120107	it's not the most comfortable bra, but it does the job and it's really pretty.  it's a tiny bit itchy, but after a while i can ignore that.  it fits really well.
120132	purchased these for an 80's party for my 17 slim son. i accidentally ordered 2 & was going to return 1 but glad i didn't because the metal part used to clip it onto your clothes of the 1st pair broke when i was clipping the back part to my sons jeans. rated a 3 because i wasted money on the 1st pair. 2nd one was fine.
120188	i just love this hat.  i can't wait to wear it.  it matches my coat.  my hair is fluffy and it looks and feels great.  plenty big enough.
120200	this is my dream suitcase.  i wanted a suitcase that always fit a regular sized plane's overhead compartment, that would not tip over with a computer in the outside pocket, and that would fit enough clothing for a 2 or three day trip.  this fits the bill perfectly.  i wish i had gotten it years ago.
120201	great bag...best i have ever had.  love the weight, room inside, and the garment bag which is included is great.  it fits well into the overhead even when packed fully.
120203	i bought two of these bags, one for my mom and one for my husband, who travels a lot for work. the bag is incredibly well-built and has just about every pocket and convenient storage area that you could want in your carry on. however, and this is a big however, both my mom and husband had to check the bag during their airline travel. my mother had to check her bag in the us, while on a trip to europe. this might be because of the smaller bag allowance. but my husband consistently has to gate-check his bag on many united flights, which are smaller planes and frequently have much smaller carry on allowances. this was a real disappointment because i bought him the bag to house his big, clunky laptop. this is one of the few bags that had a space big enough for his work laptop, which is heavy and over-large due to the type of work he uses it for. the first time he flew with this bag, and they made him gate-check it, he had to take out and carry his laptop onto the plane to avoid having it spend the flight in the baggage hold of the plane. not a catastrophe, but very inconvenient and certainly nothing that makes him want to use the bag again.so, if you are a frequent traveler in either foreign countries, or on smaller aircraft, beware of the size restrictions.
120252	i got these shoes because i'm interested in eventually transitioning to minimalist shoes, but did not want to make the jump too abruptly.  these seemed like a good intermediate step to help me lighten up and work on my fore-foot strike.  reviews were favorable, so i went for it, and i am so happy i did.  the very first run felt amazing, so light and so comfortable.  i love these shoes and look forward to putting in some more miles in them, and testing them on some longer runs.  they are perfect for what i needed: a shoe that perfectly bridges the gap between my old heavy, cushioned shoes and the nearly-barefoot minimalist pairs that are becoming so popular.  these shoes are so comfortable and light, i might not make the transition to the ultra-minimalist at all, but may instead keep on running with this style for ever.
120400	have three sets by the same maker. they have really nice feel, but they run smaller than you'd expect for pajamas. i ordered 2 sizes over, still i wish it were roomier. compared with the same type, different brand: 3x del rossa is about xl  size...
120419	i purchased these for my 21 yr. old son. he wears them all the time. they have been washed a lot already and are holding up very well. the fit is very nice and the material is soft and silky.
120424	it has been a long time since i have hadpajamas this nice to wear to bed.the satin like texture feel like heavento my body. package arived on time andthe money was well worth it. willbuy a second set very soon.just ordered three more pair of thesepajamas and they even feel and lookbetter than the first pair that ipurchased. although they are a littlelong, i have no problem walking in them.you can't beat the price any where elsefor the style and comfort. and my wifethinks that they are sexy.!!!!
120431	these boxers are hard to find, i used to be able to get them anywhere, but now i have to order them for my grown sons. they wont wear any other type. they are going to be happy xmas morning. thanks amazon. you have it all!!!!!!!!!!!
120442	i ordered the small and it fits my 5'3&#34; 120 lb frame great. i love the shoulder straps are adjustable and this is sooooo comfortable. i'll be ordering more in other colors
120445	she replies:so comfy in bed,warm and loose  feeling,silky.the lengh of the pants ..perfect !!top silky smooth.great feeling by the touch of the material.
120453	arrived today, bf had me put them on right away, he loved them and i loved them, they look and feel great.
120578	yes, it works. it smoothes out all the uneven parts and makes you look about 10 lbs lighter. however, i can't wear it. apparently, i am allergic to the rubber/silicon part on top, that keeps this brief from moving. i had welts in the shape of the rubber liner for days; it was itchy and burning. i also tried to put some tissue between the liner and the skin and it still wasn't enough. turns out, i simply can't wear it.
120607	"i am a very consistent size 10.  according to the size chart on the packaging, a medium fits size 10 or 12.  that is mission impossible.  i thought i was going to pass out and break the elastic around the waistband trying to get it over my hips...ouch ouch ouch!  when i finally got the garment on, i was so disappointed to see that it offered very little tummy control.  it is not ""firm control"" whatsoever.  the only thing tight or firm about the garment is the waistband.  seems the garment is made for women with very slim hips, moderate to large thighs, and little need for tummy control or waist whittling.  if that is you, go for it, but i will not buy a dr. rey garment again.  give me my squeem garments any day, at any price."
120722	i bought this because of the peace sign and the surfer on the back, but after a couple of weeks, it started to fall apart on me. wouldn't really recommend this for durability.
120740	i think when the wallet says large, they mean it. it is a very spacious wallet able to pack in a lot. plus it makes for wonderful alternative to the likes ofowl recycled leather taxi wallet - imagery. i think this is a great wallet to have. i highly recommend it.
120876	i purchased these boots in charcoal.  they are true to size (9) and so comfy.  i'm looking forward to wearing them this winter.
120879	i didn't really care for the lattice boots. they look fabulous online or on a model's foot, however when i put them on i did not like them on me.
120894	this shoe is very cute - i got the beige.  it's a beautiful color.  sadly, it runs small and narrow.  i will be sending it back.  i tried to break them in at home, but my feet realyl feel crammed into these shoes.  i am thinking of reordering them in a bigger size with wide width.
121025	this product is useless. i bought it (12-18 month) for my 6 month old baby girl. but we couldnt put it on. so dont waste your money.
121050	i love it.  it is made well and arrived all in one piece with no scratches or broken glass. now, i can see at a glance all my rings, their colors, and their styles.  they were in four places before and i would forget what i had where.  i liked the feature that you can choose the size box you want.  it's not one size fits most. i checked out other vendors but they either didn't have a jewelry box for just rings or the jewelry box was too expensive.  i would have no problem ordering from this vendor again.
121056	very stylish and nice tshirt., i like it a lot, it looks great.the sizing is different though. i wear us medium and i usually get asian xl (us large) from their other t-shirts because they run small but not this one. it comes a little bit bigger. so i returned and got the asian l (us medium) and it fits perfectly.
121119	bought it for our daughter. the face, of the watch, is the size of a half dollar coin. works great. daughter loved it. great color. no scratches. packed well. no issues.
121183	since this sweater comes from europe automatically figure on sizing up one. i know this from past experience.it is very soft and the length is perfect. it goes great with jeans as well as dress clothes.great product & great seller!
121214	i ordered these sunglasses for my 12 year old nephew.  the description stated they would fit a 12 year old, well, they are sized more for a 2 year old.  they are very small and would only fit a very tiny head.  they are being returned.
121234	i have a large head, this hat fits well.it is pretty warm when the side flaps are down, that is nice. the materials and workmanship seem high quality.cons:1. it is not water repellent. the faux fur will really soak up water, and the entire outer portion is somewhat absorbent fabric.2. when you close the clasp below your chin, it is not tight at all. in fact, the flaps go quite a ways below my chin.3. when you close the clasp above your head, with the side flaps folded up, the hat does not stay attached very well. it is liable to fall off.
121300	hubby loves it
121326	unfortunately i cannot give high praise yet on my new nike+ sportband.  it arrived dead as a door nail ... and would not charge in any usb port i tried.  thanks to amazon being so great, i used the return feature and a new one will be shipped out a.s.a.p!so this is not a bad review on the product, but only this particular unit.  i will re-post once i try out a working model.
121385	this dress looks great online. the fabric itself even looks great in person. the trouble is that the dress is really cheaply made and has no support whatsoever. i didn't bother returning it but would never wear it our of the house. it is a nightgown/house dress.
121422	"without a doubt, the most comfortable sandal i have ever, ever worn! it's the kind of shoe you can put on in the morning and never feel like your feet are wearing anything. it's as though you are barefoot with protection for your soles. ""zilch"" is a fitting name. as long as teva makes this style, i'm going to be a buyer. love it, love it, love it!"
121487	i have these in all the colors and i love them. fits great, colors last, washes and dries well....and they are warm without being too toasty....great for layering...fits well under jackets.
121503	hii bought this watch cuz it contain a good color mixture . nice on hand even big slightly,also have a perfect reading in the darkbut the dates are difficult to read , too small scale , i don't know why??!!
121542	when you wear scrubs every day it's hard to make your outfit your own. as birkis, they are amazingly comfortable and durable. of course loose fitting as well so downsize if you like them to be more fitting. i have gotten so many comments on these great clogs and now everyone knows me as &#34;the doctor with the skull shoes&#34;. they get me through my call shifts and my feet don't hurt the next day!
121584	if you are looking for a watch that you can wear with your clothe of any color and get combine, this is the richt watch, but if you are looking for quality don't look at this one
121590	i have tons of silver and white gold jewelry and needed a better cleaning product that the &#34;dip&#34; jar product i was using. having jewelry professionally cleaned wasn't convenient or cost effective. i bought this based upon the great reviews and the price. honestly, i thought it wouldn't work up to expectations and that i would end up sending it back. i ignored the three minute cycle and ran my jewelry through several cycles. then i ran around and found every old piece of tarnished silver jewelry i had and &#34;played&#34; with this thing for hours. no idea how it works, but it does. the water/solution mix would get very dirt and i emptied 4 or 5 times (i cleaned maybe 30 items). even 50 year old tarnished watches came out sparkling and clean, as well as my old turquoise silver bracelet from the mid-70's (i ran these 7-10 times and changed the water/solution). i just hope the unit lasts.i highly recommend and wish i'd bought this years ago.
121619	now if you want a pair of lite wool gloves these are the ones.they have 10 fingers per pair, perfect for me.for i have 5 on each hand.if you have less fingers, these are still an excellent choice and should still work,you could either plug the empty ones, let them hang loose or cut the extras off and sew the hole..but if you have extra fingers you'd have to cut holes and those fingers would get cold.you can always buy another pair and cut the needed fingers off them,and sew onto the holes.or if you have, say,4 fingers on one hand and 6 on the other.simply cut 1 finger from 1 glove and sew it onto the other(remember you have to cut a hole for the extra finger first). with a little math you can figure out the other finger options.we won't get into the thumb thing if you know what i mean. well, by now you might have 2 pairs(or maybe more because of mistakes) of these excellent wool gloves to work with. so be creative.don't be afraid.people can be mean and stare, but you ,will know ,that all of you're fingers will be nice and toasty warm when that nasty cold weather comes a knockin.
121706	when the box was delivered yesterday, i could immediately see that the zipper on the front side of the bag was wavy.  zippers are not supposed to be wavy!  i'm sending it back.
121716	i purchased this bag in dark olive because it goes with everything.among the things i like are the outside pockets that are big enough for a smart phone and a camera.it's many divisions and zipper pockets get you organized and the bright orange interior helps you visualize everything inside with no problem. the outside sleeve on the back fit my kindle perfectly. it's light weight and stands up on it's own without collapsing. the shoulder strap is long enough for wearing cross body style. all the zippers run smooth (that's so baggallini).i'm not happy with the place where the strap attaches to the purse though. it's kind of awkward.but i can live with that.
121722	this shoe looks better on than in the pic, it is flattering, wears like a low-heel shoe, yet looks higher (thanks to the platforms, gives illusion they're higher).  i wear 6 to 6.5 med width, i ordered/received 6.5 and i must say it looks sexy, sexy, sexy, but feels like comfy comfy comfy.  i'm thinking i need a black pair.
121827	i can't speak for everyone, but, can at least say for myself that it isn't always so easy to find a good brand or pair of underwear - especially, those that come six to a pack. there is always a question of how accurately they were cut in assembly, if the colors are similar to those advertised online and if they are going to ride up. i know, for sure, that anything extremely bikini-inspired is going to be a real negative. i took a chance on fruit of the loom women's 6 pack low rise briefs, after reading positive feedback about them on amazon. based on what other customers had said, they were very comfortable and were made from (mostly) cotton.this six pack arrived promptly, after i ordered them. the colors were nice ones like heather grey, purple and even a sunny yellow. i don't usually wear yellow underwear, but the shade isn't so tacky that i won't give it a try! the cotton breathes well and the cut isn't so baggy that it's comparable to granny panties, yet, isn't so revealing that you feel like they might ride up during the day. i have been very pleased with them, and when i washed them in the laundry machine, they weren't so fragile that i had to de-string them afterwards. i would recommend these and may be purchasing more of their products in the future.
121833	they are a great purchase. the size is right. the colors were different but that is how they displayed the purchase. but they are colors i would choose. not to far off from displayed.
121886	i do highly recommend these panties.  they wash and dry beautifully.  they wear well and they don't roll down or shift around.i bought 3 packages of them at separate times and find myself consistently going back to them when i need more.i bought the white this time but have bought the multi colored ones as well.  i just feel for the summer .. nice white clean cotton panties are refreshing.great price, too ~~~!!!
121906	but comfortable enough.  nice cotton liner.  hugs body so that clothes do not pull down with movement. would probably purchase again when needed.
121912	i like this colorful underwear set because it is comfortable and good for any occasion. it is going to be a great gift.
121979	i haven't been able to buy undies that fit for over a decade.  with the 'fattening' of america, new clothes are cut larger.  pant legs swim on me, yet they fit at the waist.  undies fit at the waist, these fit in the buttocks but like all of them i buy, the leg openings are huge.  that makes them ride up.  i have now bought approximately a dozen different brands & styles.  i am going to keep at it until i find ones that fit 'teenage' legs.  i have an apple shape body, meaning same size legs & butt i had in my 20's, but all the weight i've gained over the years going to my middle.  ugh!  that's why i still wear bikini undies.  they fit below the belly fat role.  but i still need to cover privates.  these do not work on my body type.  i suspect they'd be great on pear shape beautiful women. so far the only undies i've found that fit (some work when you put them on but stretch out during the day), are 'barely there women's flex to fit bikini panty' (you may want to buy one size larger than your size if you are on the upper side of your size).  i hope this helps others.
121999	this product has inferior material to fl previous products.  the leg opening is more cheaply made and it feels not forgiving at all.  i am disappointed with this product and have worn this type for years.  the reason i bought these is because i have same product by same manufacturer purchased at walmart a couple years ago.  i like them so well that i wanted more.  these are same material, same size, same product name but an inferior product.
122041	these panties are supposed to be made of cotton...but this is a very rough feeling cotton and very thin material.  i suppose theyare okay considering the cost, however it would have been more wise to purchase better quality.
122061	wallet is ok but it is not fashion as i have expected , it is not recommended for those who lie fashion things.
122067	this is one of the best wallets i have ever owned. the extra pockets for credit cards is great. does not look over-sized and slips in and out of my back pocket without any problems. good price compared to other well-known brands.after having this wallet for some time i had to come back and reevaluate this differently. inside id pocket is not wide enough to hold my driver license plus my retired military id card. the pocket ripped on one side while trying to remove one of the two cards from that pocket. had to come back to do a better review after having this wallet for sometime.
122170	oh crap! this isn't what i thought i ordered.  the color is nothing like the illustration.  it is primarily orange with some brief light purple and off-red sections. the material appears to be a dyed shoelace and the grips on each end are attached tentatively (and not very securely) to the cord.  i bought a pair for my wife to use on her reading glasses but she simply doesn't like them. i'm disappointed.
122220	i had to return one pair that was too big, i ordered according to most people,  1/2 size smaller than usual, and they were too big, so then i got my size like i used to , when america was still making shoes.. now they are the best darned shoe i have worn in a long, long time. also i am glad i ordered the bushacre , they will no doubt will last longer
122257	i loved how this looked on the model. i figured it would be easy to pack and wear on an hawaiian trip. i tried it on and it was so folded over and scrunched i looked like i was wearing a colorful lunch bag with my head sticking out.i'm 5'3&#34; and normally wear a 4-6 petite size in dresses.
122260	"i love this dress. i haven't gotten a chance to wear it out of the house yet because its been too windy, but i tried it on and didn't want to take it off. the colors are so bright and beautiful, and the fabric is light and silky. i am 5'5"" 140lbs and c cup size, and this dress shows off my body and curves in a very flattering way, can't wait to wear it out!"
122276	i wanted to start adding some real gold to my jewelry collection without spending a fortune. these are lovely and reasonably priced.  someone used to large or heavy pieces might be disappointed, but i knew they would be petite and i love them...
122284	i ordered it in xl, i could have ordered in l and it would have been ok. i do love the pajamas it's super soft and light. the t-shirt could pass as a regular t-shirt, very good material. i would definitely recommend it! i wish they had more styles, i would get a couple more of these!! :)
122313	fine, except that the directions are so small as to be impossible to all but the most nearsighted to read, and the operations too complicated to make it practical to use unless you are very techno savvy
122320	this watch is a great 1st timex watch for the adventurous boy or girlwe'll made with clear , essay to read dial
122391	each earring has 3 different size pearl, ranging from end pearl, (med to lar) to tiny.  within  the tiny pearls are &#34;litter&#34; balls you might find in ball room dancing that spinn around throwing off different colors from broken glass.
122426	fit great! i am a 32 waist and smalls fit great. i have bought these 3 different times from amazon and they wear great and are just perfect.
122516	"these are ok quality for the price, but not outstanding. no better than generic hankies that come in cheap 12 packs. fabric is on the thin side. these are made in china and did they really have to slap a ""made in china"" sticker on every single hankie in the pack?"
122545	i wouldn't wear my vibram five fingers without these socks. at least not for running. they keep blisters from forming and are therefore an essential part of my day. good quality and long lasting. i wear a size 8 us running shoe and a size 40 vibram. these socks fit me perfectly.
122555	i originally saw this ring posted on polyvore.  i pinned it to my pinterest page and started looking for who carried this ring. i found it here at a great price. i purchased this ring as a birthday gift - to myself as a middle finger ring. i had to send the first ring back, size 9. too small for the pointer and middle finger. in fact in did not go over the knuckle. it just barely fit my ringer so after all that i would say these run small and only come in whole sizes. i decided to order 2 sizes up to 11 to be sure it fit my middle finger. it is loose on my middle finger but fits my pointer finger.  all that to say....this ring does not look good on your ring finger it is too long vertically - it was at my knuckle.  it also does not look good on the pointer finger - it is too much and looks like a big ring too big for the finger.  on the middle finger it is perfect and looks well placed. i wear this on my right hand. i actually think it would make by wedding band look bad next to it!  it is an awesome piece and looks great alone on your hand - even bangles on your wrist take away from how striking this ring is.  i have since seen this ring on several polyvore outfits - it appears to be very popular as a casual piece of jewelry. 10/2012i returned the ring to amazon and ordered the 11 without any problems.  i got a credit within days of mailing it back.  i used the ups label from amazon and dropped it in a ups drop box. i highly recommend using this service for returns. quick and easy.
122558	this ring is gorgeous and fits great, i had it on my wish list for over a year and finally decided i couldn't live without it! it was a great decision!
122580	i ordered this skirt with some matching thigh-highs because i thought it'd be super sexy. it arrived fast which made me happy, but it is not the same skirt in the picture, and is not as described. it's not even slightly form fitting, the waste-band is different than the picture. never mind the fact i ordered a large which is supposed to be 15 inches long.... this one is 12 inches long!oh, and it makes a swishing noise, but no one seems to notice but me.
122599	short beyond decent. definitely not something i could wear, my fault, i read a man's review, what was i thinking? a skirt fit to be portrayed in the book '50 shades of gray'.  need i say more!?
122612	soft, comfortable, can be worn all day long and feet feel great at the end of the day.dress them up or down. i would recommend these shoes.
122697	now i just have to worry about criminals who know how to easily get past such locks :(  wish i would have instead gotten better luggage.
122716	this is great for all sorts of bags! just wish the stand would stay down- bungy cords will pull it up when hooked to the top if there is little or no weight on the stand.
122795	couldn't be happier with these skirts--i wound up ordering another one, so i had four.  they look great on, and were perfect for the use i put them to--costuming a uso number in a musical at a professional theatre.  had the perfect look for 1940's uso, but was flirty enough around the hem to allow for the choreography.  very happy!  they also just look great on the ladies wearing them, so they are definitely fashion forward.
122920	light and comfortable.  fits well (i'm 6-1 and 175; guys with larger waistlines are going to want the x-large size so it covers well enough in the front when seated).  but it has the same design flaw that many robes do: the pockets are too close to the front edges of the material, so when the robe is tied closed, putting your hands in the pockets means ... having your hands right in front of your crotch: neither a terribly comfortable position, nor one that you want your neighbors to see you in when you step outside to grab the newspaper.  (does anyone at the factory actually try one of these on, and wear it for a couple hours, before putting it on the market?  sheesh!)  the sleeves are a bit short, but that keeps them out of the way when, say, making coffee in the morning, and this is, after all, a warm-weather robe -- i have a heavier robe with a hood and longer sleeves for the winter. so i'll keep this, but i'd pay more and rate it five stars if they'd put a little thought into the placement of the pockets.
123024	i wore them on a long backpack trip. i really cant say if they helped my performance.  but i did look awesome in them!
123026	these socks are great for graduated compression if you want a very thick socks.  the thickness of these socks are on par with some of my thickest hiking socks, so for everyday use at work, not what i was looking for.  these would be great for colder temperatures or for outdoor sports, but if you're looking for something breathable for everyday wear, these are too warm.  construction of the socks seem very good.
123032	i've worn compression socks before for working out, and i ordered these to try them out.  the color was great and they were very well constructed, but the sizing was off - i could barely get these on!  compression socks are supposed to be tight (of course, since that's where the compression comes from!) but these did not compare to others that i've purchased in terms of determining a good fit.i would recommend that you look very carefully at their size chart; if you are right on the edge of one size or another, i would suggest ordering up a size for a better fit.
123041	these socks are amazing! but i am a bit of a sock lover. great compression, not too tight. fit perfect and will be great for work. absolutely recommend.
123051	ive tried many others, including travel socks supposedly designed for compression - these are the most durable and effective compression socks i have found to date, and they last and last. they have not lost compressibility, either. i am happy to recommend these as a person who ears them on a daily basis, and who just retired as an &#34;on-my-feet&#34; trainer in the workplace, often on my feet for hours on end - or at my computer designing training materials. they're even comfortable in summer, and it gets above 100 f / 38 c here.
123087	great product, appears well made and good quality. two washes, no issues with peeling or shrinking (cold water!). arrived promptly and in good condition. for a large it runs just a tiny bit smaller than i would have expected, but not enough to make it unwearable. great product!!
123110	these are very good for wearing over large boots/wading boots. great for hiking through snow to get to the river. the spikes are quite long so it's hard to walk comfortably on solid ground but in icy snow or muddy conditions these are great, especially for steep terrain.
123141	i love jeans that are not just plain denim blue - so these fit the bill for me!  the fit was slim, but my usual size worked.  if i could have tried them on before buying i would have gone a size up and then taken them in at the waist, so that i would have a little more room.  that is just my preference, for i think it is sexier not to have skin tight  jeans (doesn't look elegant) but rather a slim fit.
123200	i have worn several other brands, but this supporter is phenomenal. waist band, leg straps and pouch all feel very good against the skin. i typically wear large underwear, and the size l fits perfectly. the hexmesh pouch breaths, provides ample support and is reasonably sized.if you are runner looking for something to wear for additional support under tights or shorts then this will perform well.i think athletes or those who generally prefer to wear athletic supporters will be well pleased. i plan to order a few more to have in my sports apparel arsenal.
123453	it's hard to find anything bad about these pants for the price - i didn't like how there wasn't much of a pant leg draw string and the large fit big on my. i'm 6, 2&#34;, and 190 lbs.
123499	very comfortable robe and an excellent price. it does run large. i'm not petite, and the small/medium is extra roomy, which is fine with me. length is below the knee. very pleased with this robe.
123514	we bought this as a gift for our boss. he loved it!  its big enoungh to fit a laptop, files, an ipad and still zips up without any difficulties.
123525	debated between these and toms - glad i got these! they are perfect for individuals with narrow feet. lightweight and comfortable. loved them so much, just ordered another pair in brown. perfect for casual wear or dress up. true to size.
123552	i bought these as comfy wedding shoes to wear under my wedding dress. they were great! nobody noticed the fact that i wasn't wearing nice shoes, and i didn't have thoughts of painful feet running through my head all night.
123578	disappointing. do not order this if you are bigger than super skinny. maybe one day i will get to fit into it... lol
123593	luckily i had had these before so i knew they were going to be good.  they aren't too pricey and they last and they work at shaping.  in fact i am wearing them right now and they rock!  flexees suck at shaping and look so dont waste your money as these are way better.  if you want shaping under your clothes these are good.  flexees are see-through too and they dont shape,  so they are pointless.  i wear these capris doubled up and then they arent see-through and they work great at sucking stuff in (although they dont booty lift so i am still looking for that.)
123598	the item i ordered was a capri leggings in black xl.  i received something that said xl leggs profile form control.i could not even get my foot into the the xl.  don't waste your monbey.  seller should be ashamed to sell this crap.
123610	"i am 5'3 and 165 pounds and i got the xl, even though the chart says i can fit into a l. when i opened this thing, i laughed so hard. ""there is no way i'm getting my bubble butt into that!"" i could barely fit my arm in it! nevertheless, i decided to give it a try because my wedding dress is extremely sheer from the bustline down and i need something quickly to cover everything up, including my belly. i was really hoping this would slim me down too and for eight bucks it's worth a shot, right?i squeezed this sucker on and it took me a good while to get it on (i broke into a sweat). once it was on though, it was actually pretty comfortable! i haven't had any issues with the top part rolling down but maybe that's because i'm short so the top sits pretty much under my breasts, which hold it there. the bottom part does tend to roll up a little bit but it's impossible to see under a flowy dress.a lot of the reviews complain that it's too high and too long but that's exactly what the description says and that's exactly what i needed! my dress is a tea-length dress so the length is not a problem for me, even at my short height, and the fact that the top is so high is perfect so my belly doesn't show through my dress.the only reason i knocked a star off is because my belly is less lumpy, but it is still very much a big ol' belly. i guess it went from looking like a mound of lumpy dough to a smooth snow globe lol so if you're getting this strictly for the ""control waist"" aspect of it, you might want to spend a little more and get some spanx.i don't know how long it'll last (i'm pretty pro at ripping pantyhose and this is only slightly thicker than pantyhose material) but for the price, i definitely recommend it. i have used l'eggs products before and they're really the best you're going to get for this price range. in other l'eggs products, i find that everything is true to size but for ""control"" anything in any brand, i would always go a size up in order to be most comfortable."
123624	i'm 5'6&#34;, 145 lbs, and i ordered size l. i was originally ok with how hard it is to pull it up, it's super tight. but once i got it on, it was practically cutting my circulation at my waist line! and down at the thigh also was pinching the skin in. i don't think ordering xl would have fit me in those areas, especially the waist line! if you have a tiny waist - it might work for you.
123656	i've been looking for a bra that doesn't roll and is comfortable and i finally found it!  the price is great too!  very strongly made and i feel secure.  i would definitely recommend for big girls!
123705	the case is nice but i wanted the one with the plastic top to see the watches. mine is completely covers with the leather. i bought it as a xmas gift so there was no time to replace it. but he is happy with it and using it. that's a plus in my book.
123741	cute shoe, comfortable, but definitely runs large as other reviewers have noted.  the size 10m fits me perfectly, and i have fairly wide feet & most of my women's shoes are 11m.  i have only worn them around the house so far, but we'll see how well they hold up walking around downtown tomorrow... will update.update: after a couple of months of occasional wear, i would say that for shoes intended to be worn without socks, these are pretty great.  very comfortable and breathable.  and they're cute, but understated.  highly recommend!
123795	my husband is picky about these sorts of sandals.  these sandals arrived promptly, fit exactly as hoped.  my husband likes them a lot.  they are soft and give a little of a cushioned effect.  the surface material has a bit of an unusual feel to it, almost as if your foot feels cool and moist.  the top loop is stitched to the bottom, not just glued, which is unusual.  very well made.
123810	"sport gear 16 x 40"" duffle bag - blue diamond ripstop north star brandthese bags are amazing- designed the way a bag should be made.now, i have several sizes and use them for everything from duck decoys to stove and demo bags, this is my favorite color.they now added camonorthstar next camo gear duffel bagpros:jumbo zipper size 10 two way zipper1050 hd tuff cloth, it looks very tactical and has a super heavy feel, like the old time ballistic clothheavy strap wraps around the bag, side load handles.fabric is very water resistantcons:not much, maybe an internal security zip pocket.i hope this review has been helpful and informative. (fishgriller approved)"
123817	i own this one and the little brother to this. both are amazingly huge!!! this is a great bag for toting a weeks worth of gear, large blankets, summer or winter clothes in the off season, or even a dead body. goofing around i fit my 130 lb and 5'6 girlfriend in the bag and carried her around the house. the water resistant lining and rip-stop shell topped with a heavy duty zipper make this bag an amazing buy for the price. the smaller brother to this bag is just as good and currently holds 2 snow suits, 3 jackets, many pairs of gloves, hats and thermal polypro undergarments.
123825	this is a great, durable bag with a lot of space that's able to carry a pretty heavy load.  the size is fantastic; big enough to transport some of the larger items we have, but not so bulky that it's unwieldy either, and it rolls up quite compact for storage if you need to put it away.  a great purchase for us.
123937	my primary interest in this belt was no metal, so no need to remove it at airports, or so it was marketed. but, having just finished a trip including national and international flights, i can tell you it had to come off at all but one check point, so don't get it if that is your primary reason.in use it holds and wears well, and if you get caught in a deluge, as i did in the rainforest of costa rica, it will be just fine - no leather belt would have faired so well.
123957	super cute flats and i wear them with everything!!!! love the sparkle and the fact that bobs donates to kids in need. cool brand, cool concept!
123971	these are a true fit shoe. i ordered a size 7 even though i'm more of a 6.5 but they didn't have my size available. so these are a little loose but still very compfortable. i ordered another pair in 6.5 and they fit perfect! you won't be disapointed.
124024	i own another pair of merrell shoes and have enjoyed them for a few years. the sizing in this style is odd. i ordered the 6 1/2 which is my usual size, but my heel lifted right out of the shoe and there was an inch to spare at the toe, although they were tight at the foot. i returned them and tried the 6, but these are so narrow, they actually compress my toes although they are at the right place in the shoe. the shoes hardly accomodate a thin sock and are very uncomfortable. i thought i had perhaps ordered a narrow size by error but both are regular sizes, and both fit the same way. i'm returning this second pair and giving up on merrell for a while and will instead order another favorite of mine, which is dansko.
124026	i wear a lot of merrell shoes and always wear size 8.  i have another encore breeze in a different color size 8 that fits perfectly.  this one was way too big.  i returned it and ordered a size 7.5.  i was afraid that the first pair was just a fluke and that the 7.5 would be too small but not the case.  it fits perfectly.  go figure!  just want to add that amazon is the best to work with especially when you need to return something!!
124132	i really do like this capris, makes you sweat more than you would expect for a given workout routine.should have ordered a medium though, was trying to be safe with the large. the capris is true to size.yes, it has a funny smell, but that should be because of the material.it also make a funny sound if one part of the material rubs on another...imagine hearing a rubber sound when running and your thighs touch, still material related.this capris is still a great buy and i recommend for those that want to sweat it out when exercising.
124151	love these they make your sweat in all the right places, they dry quick,wash easy,,, the think i love the most is the pocket for your keys or phone,, and the elastic top&#8230; i had a pair before that cost way to much more than this,, that had a zipper top,,, what a crappy design that was,,, these fit great,,, no zippers and doesn't stretch out after wearing them for over a year.
124164	without a doubt this is the most comfortable and roomy bathrobe i have owned.it is warm and toasty.
124173	these are nice, elegant earrings. the pair i received were not obviously flawed, unless you look with a loupe.  very happy with purchase. have added a pic so you can see the size on an ear!
124195	the earrings were a wedding anniversary gift and i was worried about the size, but they were perfect and my wife loved them. of course i got some cool points from her co-workers.
124222	i purchased this bag awhile ago this year.i waited to rate this bag,so that i would not tell someone that something is good and it's not. this is one heck of a bag, it is big enough and has enough storage space to hold my tennis ,towels,spare pants,ab wheel,knee mat,and still had more room for the whatevers.i really recommend this bag.
124248	it definately isnt satin more like a polyester blend and it is a little tight around the chest (i ordered medium and wear a 36a bra) otherwise my better half likes the way it looks on me and its comfortable to sleep in.
124255	i haven't used this yet.  going a trip but in trying it out, it was difficult for me to open the clasp but it will probably serve the purpose i purchased it for
124268	"thi is an excellent product. the shoes are comfortable and stylish. i have men telling me how ""off the chaing"" these shoes are. i simply love them."
124326	i already ran two marathons (one road and one trail with 2000m~6000ft altitude difference) and more than 500km~350mi in training and these shoes are still holding on.they're very comfortable and you can feel the reduced shock on impact.
124336	shoe worked well at first but quickly broke down. outside of shoe is holding up well, however inside support has almost completely broken down. right insole had developed odd lumps and left insole has moved to the inside of the shoe causing an odd weight distribution that results in sore feet very quickly. not a good thing in a shoe with not many miles on it.
124350	i purchased the lighting/white/ fire. i already own the kayano so i knew the quality of asics. this is absolutely the coolest looking shoe i've ever seen and i have lots of trail and running shoes. it has both the yellow and red  colors that i love the most. the comfort and fit of an asics shoe is second to none.  you cannot do better. if you must wear them to run and subject them to getting dirty buy a second pair for casual use. wear asics socks to compliment the look. thanks asics and amazon, you are a great company to do business with.
124461	thank you amazon.com for the fast service.  as for this shoe, i am extremely pleased.  it fits well and it has the cushioning that i demand.  i wear brooks glycerin, as well as this asics shoe, both because of the superior cushioning.  i buy a running shoe with superior cushioning and still with good stability.  i only walk, but have double-hip replacements and the cushioning with stability is necessary.  love it.
124482	i overpronate and have to be careful which shoes i run in. these are awesome! super cute and great price!
124491	this was my first handbag that i purchased online. i was a bit scared because i normally have to see my bags in person before i buy. i was pleasantly surprised when i opened the box and pulled out this bag. it is very good quality and super cute! i got many compliments!
124500	i bought this purse as a gift. the person i purchased it for loved it. she liked the fact that is had spots for her phone and liked the clasp.i am glad i purchased this one.
124503	this purse is so pretty and i am always getting compliments wherever i go. good quility too. fast service also.
124525	i gave these to my wife for christmas. she really liked the different patterns/styles and said they were a perfect fit.
124530	i was hoping for a more supportive, athletic-type shoe but only lighter and without the shoelaces.  these were extremely light weight but were not cushioned enough.  they were oddly loose here and there even with a sock.  was hoping to use for casual wear and lots of walking.  felt they were not suitable for lots of walking due to lack of support.  will just wear regular athletic sneakers.
124540	these are by far the most comfortable walking shoes ever.i have a pair i wear all the time.  we are going on anothercruise on april 20th and i bought another pair for walking.wish they had more support, but a great shoe!
124553	merrell makes outstanding shoes. these were so reasonably priced, could not resist. have these shoes in 3 colors. so comfortable & the style can be worn for most occasions. terrific shoes at a fantastic price. speedy shipment.
124563	i have a terrible time finding sweats that are long enough and that aren't tight elastic waist band and these sweats meet my comfort standards by providing the longer length and they are super comfy. after wearing the sweats all day i went back to order more only to find most of the colors are sold out in the size i wear. i'd love to have more of these sweats!
124570	these are thick sweat pants. i don't have any problem with the waist. it is low, but there is a draw string, so you can adjust the size. they are very long. i'm 5'8 and they are dragging the floor, but i got them to knock around the house, so i'm not worried about it. they feel like they will be very warm for the winter.
124571	i really like these sweatpants, but i had to remove the waistband because they were very uncomfortable.  i'm a size 6-8 in pants and i got a medium, which fit everywhere but the waist.
124581	i usually wear a small so that's what i got. i got the black color. comfortable, warm, fit pretty well - not close to the body but not super baggy either. tighter in the waist then they should be, but not enough to be uncomfortable on me. i could see these being great when the weather turns colder - right now they may be a bit too warm for me though. i am happy with my purchase!
124659	well, i'd like to review this one, but unless someone buys it for me i guess i'll just have to dream.
124678	for the price this watch fits what i need.  although the color is lighter than it is in the picture.  it is more of a light lime green.  it works great.  it does tick a little louder than most, but for $7, what do you expect.
124697	i love this new jacket so so much! its so adorable and perfect for fall and light winters.i bought it early summer because i figured if i can find it now for cheap i might as well just get it now.plus my house gets really cold so i can just wear it around the house with some yoga pants and it looks so cute!im pretty small so i bought the 10/12, i'm 4'10 and 95 pounds so i figured this would fit pretty well.its a tad roomy but i don't think i would want it any smaller so its fine :)love it anyways!
124743	as one reviewer said if you wear large buy x-large, and here is secret to having the white stay white for years. go to lowe's or home depot, and around the paint department, they sell tsp (tri-sodium phosfate) add 1 teaspoon per load of white laundry and your whites will never look whiter. tsp used to be in laundry detergent years ago and the usa had it removed, where in europe they stil have it in thier detergents.
124755	i read the comments about this bag having cheap looking material which i have to disagree with. it's well made and there is a perfect amount of space if you're not someone who goes around carrying junk in their bag.
124767	searching for the perfect bag - this is the closest yet. it is small enough to avoid shoulder strain yet large enough to hold minimum requirements. if it had enough structure to stand up on its own, it would be perfect!
124783	this coat is not for someone making a fashion statement this is for the person who works and plays in the outdoors under servere conditions ive worn many others they just dont compare this jacket will give you many years of durability and comfort at a price that is affordable
124864	i couldn't believe it but they came with no pockets at all. had to trash them....who makes shorts with no pockets?
124868	my husband said that these are tight in the crotch and run small in size. we returned them and bought mens solid color with racing stripe skate surf board short / swim trunks instead.
124876	my husband is 198 lbs, 5' 10'', large was too wide for him and too long, much longer than on the picture, it reached his knees. had to return it, the quality is ok, but we didn't do a test drive in the sea :-)
124881	i love this nightgown....it is the most comfortable,nightgown i have ever owned.  i want to purchase more colors!  it is so soft, fits well....i really like the twist design in the front, and nice comfortable straps.  it fits like a halter top at the top, but is not, as it has semi-wide straps.  it ties in the back for adjustment.  this material washes well, keeps it shape & softness and is dryer safe.  the color stays true, even after many times being washed in my washer.  this is so beautiful, i am considering wearing it out for social events, as it is beautiful, and could pass as a sun dress.  i love this nightgown!
124896	"these leggings fit great.i am 6""tall .usually the leg to crotch length is too short.i am happy with my purchase"
124903	my bearpaws were better than i expected. the quality is very good and i love the dark brown color i chose.  the only thing i would say to consider when purchasing is the size.  they are very true to size.  i'm a size 9 in shoes and my toe is right at the end of the shoe.  i could have worn a size 91/2 very comfortably, but they only come in full sizes and i believe a size 10 would be too long causing my heel to slip when walking.  the inside of the boot is very insolated and can be worn bare foot keeping your feet very warm and comfortable at your true size. however, wearing socks will make the length feel shorter and very uncomfortable.  i am considering purchasing another pair in black and will probably order the size 10 and wear socks.  either way, you can't go wrong for the price.
124926	i bought 24 months suit for my 21 months old girl in pink.  material is slightly thinner than i'd like it to be but for the price, i think it is a great purchase.  it is pretty easy to put it on and off but i feel like the arm and leg openings should be a bit narrower(or tighter) so that they don't go up so easily.
124929	very cute, soft, cool. a negative point is the size, it is really big for my 33 inches, 24 lbs little boy. he still wears it when he plays outside for a while, but it could easily be mistaken for some original pj's too!
124945	this holds my hoarder collection of jewelry and doesn't use up precious real estate in my small home. i love it because my jewelry doesn't get tangled and forgotten about. usually i would open one of the many boxes i keep my jewelry in, see the disorganized mess, and close it up again. with this i can easily see all my jewelry and it is never tangled. it is well made,sturdy, and holds a lot. i actually have an extra shelf in my linen closet now!
124946	thank god for this over the door jewelry organizer. i use to use jewelry boxes all the time and never wore my jewelry because i didn't feel like going through all those items. but now i wear some piece of jewelry daily i love how it plenty of room for plenty rings and necklaces. one down side i had mine over the door but decided to wall mount it because of the noise from the door being opened and shut.
124983	i ordered this bra along with the pack of 5 panties.  nice fit and comfortable.  also matches the blue lace panties in the 5 pack of panties very well.
125003	first i'm 4'9 an a 34 dd african american ..i know right! but anyway i cant fine a bra in the store to save my life, i lucked up on this on amazon...love the print,its so hard to find a great supportive bra, on top of being sexy..its either one or the other for me, or simply they dont have it.i ordered just one to give them a chance...now i have to have more. everthing fits, i'm ordering more.far as price i thing is ok for what your geting, think about it, you go into a store and buy a grandma bra! for 45! an it fits but far from sexy, or it's sexy but your falling out..smh this is the bra you want
125022	i have been searching for the perfect panties.  not too high, not too low, just right.  i thought these would be great - i like the hipster style which sits about 3 inches below the waist, and the elastic is nice and flat.  i wear a size 6 pants, and have a &#34;normal&#34; body shape (average sized booty and hips).  i ordered these in a medium (size 6).  they fit okay, not too big or too small, but they still ride up a bit in the rear and create a panty line.  the material is not as soft as i would like, but i expect that to improve with continued washings.  i have found the gap low rise hipster to be a much better fit for me.
125032	the upper band of elastic ran rendering this underwear useless for whatever reason the other colors are fine, quality is a 5/10, kinda thin but i had to buy some underwear quickly and not near enough to a store
125038	these vanity fair bikini panties are so soft and comfortable.  they stretch to fit and they're nearly weightless.  i hardly notice that i have anything on.the elastic waist and legs set this apart from other brands.  they are thin and wide, which greatly lessons the underwear lines.i couldn't have been happier with this purchase.  i plan on going back to buy more.
125053	they are true to size.  and a nice addition when i wear jeans or shorts or even certain dresses.  i will definitely buy another pair when my current ones fall apart.
125072	when i first got this hat it worked for me because i had long hair that i put up on top of my head and needed the extra space, but once i cut my hair in a pixie, this lady's head was too small for the hat.  the front goes down into my eyes.  what worked for me (because i worked outside in the winter months) was an extra layer of a smaller hat underneath.
125120	wow, bought these because of the great reviews and i am happy i did. so cute, love the color and the fit is perfect. i have asics for running and bought these because they are specific to dance. i do zumba, dance and turbo fire....and these are perfect for them. great lateral support and they handle well with any move; no pain in tendons, ankles, or feet. you will love these.
125155	i got the one in light blue and brown. the actual color matches that in the picture. this is a very versatile scarf. i am thinking about getting more in different colors.
125174	i have received many compliments on this scarf.  the color is perfect and the fabric is simply beautiful.  i have since ordered another as a gift.
125179	got this for my mom to add to a tote i got her for christmas.  this is really a beautifyl scarf at a great price.  soft with a subtle pattern of black on deep purple.  very  pretty.i'm adding to this review because i have now bought 5 of these beautiful scarves!  i have kept a few and given some as gifts. the recipients are always blown away by the softness and beautiful weave.  this is a really beautiful pashmina - it is so much more than the price point, i just wanted to amend my review to let buyers know that if you saw this in a store, you would find it for 2 to 4 times the price at least.  this is a great deal, and all the ones i have bought are just gorgeous!  you will not be disappointed with these scarves!
125186	this necklace is much thinner than i expected, not very satisfied with it..but not worth the trouble returning it.  also, the chain twists very easy and shows kinks.  send a bit more money to get better necklaces. not recommended
125198	after 6 months, the fabric just fell apart.  i was pretty religious about rinsing it out after pool swims, but once the fibers started to go, the shorts just lost their integrity, and opacity.  i liked it while it worked, but it just has to have a longer product life span.
125205	"these cycling shorts are made from a light polyester-like fabric and sport a single zippered pocket.  these shorts include the pearl izumi men's liner short which can be purchased separately.  the shorts are reasonably priced when you consider the cost of the liners.the material is light but stays in place as you ride.  the amount of material is not skintight nor saggy & rarely gets caught on my saddle.  the single zippered pocket is ample enough to hold a medium wallet (located on the lower portion of the right leg)  edit:  the single, limited pocket is the worst of these shorts.  more pockets in other locations would have been very desirable.  limit what you carry or store stuff elsewhere with these.the elastic waistband adjusts with several buttons on each side of the shorts.  a pair of loops inside the waistband clip to the short liners (to avoid sagging?) i purchased a medium size for an approx. 35"" waist and only a minor adjustment to the waistband was needed.  edit:  check the other reviews for sizing advice.  some say the shorts run a bit large.the padded liner portion of the shorts are definitely the highlight of the product and i suggest you check out those independent reviews (search pearl izumi men's liner short).  the existing user reviews on the liners are very clear and constructive.  i will be purchasing more of the liners in the near future - they work well with other shorts."
125230	i bought this bracelet for my youngest daughter that doesn't keep up with jewelry like she should.  the bracelet looks great though and she couldn't tell that it wasn't a pandora brand.  i don't think she really cares, to be honest!  she doesn't normally wear jewelry, but i would like her to become more interested.  we shall see!
125305	these flats are abfab!!!  i recently wore them on a day trip to new york city. i cannot believe how well they fit, especially after all that walking!  i love the shape of them and they just look so cute and simple, the perfect match for everyday comfort! they look adorable with skinny jeans with the hem folded up a smidgen.  i also have the emmie ii ballet flat (same flat, but has clover on heel instead of stitches) in pink. i happen to love these black emmie flats more because they seem to confirm better.  my pink are a little more rigid, but still awesome too. you cannot go wrong with these. i need more colors!!  i feel so lucky to have found them!!
125419	cheap is all i can say. it didn't work not sure if it even had a battery!! and the minute wand just moves back and forth when you move the watch, terrible!
125442	lovely color, fdiy buy sdtarted to snag upon first washing., i was unfamiliar with the mesh so i should have probably turned it inside out. i witll do this to this one and the maroon one which has not snagged.
125451	if i wanted to be very accurate in rating i would give these 3.5 . they are supportive, true to size , the straps stay put but not very comfortable. thy dig in my flesh although not tight! will not repurchase.
125502	i highly recommend these slippers to anyone who loves pink and huge fluffy, comfortable slippers. i wear them 24/7 just to show them off. you will not be disappointed. each one is about 10 inches wide where the claws are. have not tried washing them yet, but i will add that info once i find out.
125551	i am very impressed with these earrings. the silver at the top is quite impressive, especially for the price. i feel the tigers eye is beautiful, and they look even better in person.
125553	wear for all reasons and all seasons, will go with several necklaces and bracelets if you care to. i like dangles and these are the perfect size. nice for work or other somewhat casual place. i would give these as a gift to myself or some other person that enjoys dangle earrings!  smart looking!
125566	the shirt is very nice the size its good too my son is 5 and i bought x small which is size 6 and its good on him and hase space to grow(my son is skinny)the sleeves are little long so i am sure he can wear it for a while. the fabris is a lot thicker that his other shirt and because of that it is very hard to put it through his head and even harder to take it off and thats why i took away one star.
125605	it is very cute , but very small. i thought it was much bigger and would fit all my earrings, but it is not. if you want something small and delicate this is for you. i would have rated it higher if it was a bit bigger and had more space for earrings and stuff. will look beatiful in a corner somewhere so people can admire it. it came in perfect time and i was very excited to see the detail and intricate designs on it.
125627	the shoe sizing was smaller than expected and we were advised to order a size larger....so we did and that that helped. however, the toe strap on one show was twisted and caused a blister on my wife's foot. she only wore them once and never again! for that price, we expected a better quality!
125647	i have anumber of fit flop clogs, and i like them a lot. i figured these would be the perfect summer clog, the shape is very similar, and yet my toes are free to the open air. unfortunately they don't fit at all the same. they are too tight around the instep, and longer in the foot bed. i was greatly disappointed. not giving up on fit flops, i'm going to try their actual flops. but lesson learned, i will go into a brick and mortar for my first pair so i can try them on before i order anymore online.
125716	these are the lightest comfiest running shoes i've ever owned.  for nurses or anyone who spends alot of time on their feet in the day, these would make a perfect choice.i would not recommend these shoes for anything but running on a treadmill or flat ground.  they do not have enough side support for trails.
125748	i purchased this little crossbody/clutch at a local store in the python color. i was looking for something to fit my iphone (in its bulky otterbox defender case), a few make up items (mascara, compact, tissues), cash/cards. i really love the convenience of the crossbody option. i was able to wear it as a clutch and then when i went out to dance, i was able to pull the crossbody strap out (this is totally removable but i just tucked it into the main compartment) and wear it dancing, keeping my valuables with me at all times. it served me well and today my teenage daughter stole it from me to wear it out shopping. there are numerous zippered pockets that you can secure items in. if you pack your items carefully, you will be able to fit quite a bit more than expected given its size, you just need to play around with it a little bit. i was shocked my otterbox fit in this so easily. i'm actually online now looking to buy this in another color or one for my daughter so she will stop stealing mine!
125756	just beautiful. .very well made..great quality. .arrived in a timely manner. .packaged very well in excellent condition. .absolutely love it..perfect size for chain or bracket..thinking about purchasing another one...would highly recommend this product. ..
125789	i bought this  and got it the day before a long trip. not one worked all had broken zippers total junk! do not but does not work at all !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! not only couldn't i make stuff smaller i count even zip ant part of it closed and just use tohold things . the fact that not one worked was not just bad luck.
125794	they don't change the weight but they give you more room in your bag - always a plus - gave one to each of our kids and they love them!
125822	perfect
125919	looked cute but it felt narrow and had rough material around the edges, no arch support/padding inside, rubbed at the heel. cheap quality that might fit some feet better but they uncomfortable overall.
125934	i really like this necklace, it's pretty simple but adds a nice touch. it feels like its well made and i love the length. have worn it a ton since i got it, glad i bought it.
125950	"nice quality, nice looking. the material is a little thinner than i was expecting - it uses special light-weight ""quick drying"" material. as far as sizing, i'm around 5'11, 34 waist - the medium fits fine (same as pictured)."
125983	i hate to order bras online instead of trying them on in the store, but after a few failed in-store attempts to find a bra i like, i decided to just order some online. i ordered 3 bras (different brands) and i like 2 of them. this one is my favorite! the 34dd fits me well (i am usually either a 32ddd or a 34dd). it is quite comfortable and provides good support, and all this at an excellent price. it does look as though this bra is made slightly cheaply, so we'll see how it holds up, but if it even lasts for 6 months that's fine, it was cheap enough!
126020	these cat-eye ray ban frames were stylish and well made.  a must have for that unique look.  unfortunately, they didn't suit the shape of my face.
126105	just arrived, and i like it weights very light.  my samsonite that i had before was beautiful, never damaged but too heavy to use now.i also tried to register warranty on line, it didn't go through.when tried to set the lock my finger slipped, and i didn't remember what number it was.  i couldn't find instruction for setting lock, then i read reviews about this suitcase and started worried.  will it cracks that easily? bad customer service?  while being skeptical, i filled out on-line request for my concerns.next thing i did is setting the lock, and my fingers slipped after one turn. it won't be unlocked forever, i thought.  since i turned only one number out of three, it didn't take me long to figure out what it was.  i also find instruction for setting the lock in the small pocket inside the suitcase.after two days, i got a call from delsey and found out that on-line registration was not necessary but receipt.  i also learned that 10-year warranty covers damage during flight but they need to see the actual damage.  if i have to spend postage to send it out for inspection, i'd better buy samsonite and forget about not making good choice.  i used credit card that has 1 year extend warranty that applies after manufacture warranty.  it it cracked, all i need to do is waiting for 10 years for refund if  i remember.i somehow regret about myself not being careful.since i have not used yet, for now, 3 stars.
126145	the workout pants are sheer and satin feeling, while also durable. for working out, the size is a little smaller. for use primarily working out, order a size larger.pros: silky feel, durable, comfortable, and look great.cons: no free return shipping. ny lingerie charges for return shipping. make sure the size is right.
126146	"for somone looking for basic, high quality warmup pants, these are perfect.  they're soft, fit great, look good, and have the all the basics: pockets, zipper cuffs, and a drawstring. as long as you're not looking for a ""how-cool-am-i"" fashion label, these are perfect."
126166	these make me feel as dressed up underneath as well as on top. nicely fitted although not as they're not as tight and shaping as rago. the detail in back is a little bumpy so these are not the best choice for dresses that cling to your rear. i ordered based on my natural waist measurement (higher than dress/vanity size) and they fit very well.
126185	in the interest of full disclosure, i have several paris of reebok comparable shoes and give them high marks for the time i've had them in service or the past couple of years.  i bought these puma kicks after receiving a recommendation from a guy at the local gym who has the same issue as my own, meaning vulnerable or bad feet.  the first thing i noticed with this puma brand shoe is a snugger fit.  still comfortable but giving the impression of a little better support because the foot is less likely to move around during use.that feature is important because of possible slippage leading to falling and attendant injury during a jog or intense weight workout at the gym.  i gave the pumas a test on both counts & must say i was impressed.  the support was excellent and stability a shade better than with the reeboks so the pumas get on the scoreboard early. they're also lighter in weight by an ounze or two or at least, seem so to me.  now, 'early' is important to note because i obviously have no way of knowing how well they'll hold up in the weeks and months ahead.  the reeboks have been excellent in that regard but if the pumas prove to have quality longevity, i'll improve my ranking to a full 5 stars.  at first blush, the pumas have been impressive.
126207	skirt was ok quality. didn't keep or wash -only tried on after i received it. it seemed to run &#34;big&#34; in size. may have gotten smaller after i washed. skirt only -no shorts attached. expected it to be a skirt-shorts combo. it wasn't.
126295	i really like this watch. it does have a big face and the stem does stick out a fair bit but i have a large wrist and it doesn't worry me at all.the watch came brand new in good working order with high priced price tag attached and wrapped in plastic as a new one would.ajusting the time and date was very easy and the band was one link to big, the link was easily removed with a couple of very small screw drivers.one point of interest that i had read from another reviewer of a similar watch was that their watch fell apart from lost screws in the band. i checked the screws in this one and found that a couple were loose, i tightened them all up and no worries, all good, i would recommend this to save any tears later!good value at the amazon price i think, and the delivery was earlier than scheduled.i've had all good comments about the style and the colour (from the ladies!), so i'm vey happy with it.d
126347	i received these earring as a gift and love them.  they are well made and quite pretty.  there are smaller then the picture implies but still lovely, with nice movement. i wear them as often as possible.highly recommend!
126355	i purchased these pants a little over a year ago and have to say that i am in love.i wear these pants several days a week year round.  they are as comfortable as sweatpants but you can still wear them in public without appearing like you have given up on life.  i wear them in a lot of situations including hiking, camping, and just lounging around.  i have found that they are great for biking if you use the snaps on the legs to roll them up.  also in the summer i will often wear them rolled up in place of shorts.  they breathe well and dry quickly.  for long plane rides or car trips they can't be beat.i have a 35&#34; waist and typically wear a 30&#34;-32&#34; inseam.  the size l, 32-inch inseam fit well in the waist and through the legs but were just a little longer than i like so i brought them to the tailor to have them shortened one inch and they now fit perfectly.they have held up extremely well over the last year which is impressive given the beating they take while biking and the number of times i have worn and washed them.  i also recently purchased the prana nemesis knickers in charcoal for the specific purpose of biking to hopefully save some wear and tear on these.the cargo pocket has zippers on both the front and top.  i didn't think much of this feature until i realized i could easily access my wallet and anything else i store in the cargo pocket while sitting down or riding my bike.  it has proved to be pretty useful.there is not much negative i can say about the pants.  there probably isn't a single person that wouldn't be able to find a use for a pair.
126358	"i just bought this dress and the quinn dress, and love them both!  they are the first items i've bought from prana, but probably won't be my last since the quality and fit are excellent.as for sizing, i went with the small and it's perfect. (i'm 5'4"" and weigh about 120 pounds.) one previous reviewer noted that this runs small, and it does fit a bit tighter than the quinn dress, but the medium definitely would have been too big.  the inner shelf bra is also supportive enough for my 32d chest, and not too tight.  i love it when i can get away with not wearing a bra (especially with an intricate back like the one on this dress), and this allows for that with no ""headlights"" showing through.also, i had been worried that this amaya dress and the quinn dress wouldn't suit my hourglass shape and that they might look too boxy on me, but both still emphasize my curves.  the slight dip in the front panel of this dress is also nice for hourglass shapes since it doesn't create a boxy look to the front of it.the fabric on this is also interesting.  it feels like a cotton, but i guess it's prana's veeda fabric, which is a blend of recycled polyester, spun polyester, and spandex.  it has a nice stretch/give to it, and it's supposed to be quick-drying. i bought the lake flower power blue color, and it's just as punchy and vibrant as it appears on my computer monitor.i'll update my review after i've washed both dresses a few times to note how well they hold up. in the meantime, i know i'll be wearing my amaya dress a lot this summer.update on 8/2/12:  i wore this dress and the quinn dress quite a bit on a 24-day cruise we just got back from, and both held up really well.  i sent both dresses to the ship's laundry a few times, where i know they washed the dresses in hot water and dried them on high heat, but both maintained their color, shape, and size.  now that i'm back home, i'll be washing it on delicate and hanging it to dry, but it's nice to know that the quality is good enough to stand such harsh washing.  the moisture-wicking properties of this dress were also great in hot, humid climates."
126373	this bag, although a nice size on the outside, is actually quite awful.  the inner lining isn't actually the size of the bag.  it cuts off about a quarter of the way down.  so basically, the inside of the bag has the storage space the size of a medium clutch.  what a huge disappointment!  i was so let down.  i thought this bag could fit my laptop and school books, but i couldn't fit more than my ipod, pencil case, and a calculator in it!so even thought the picture looks like you're getting a massive hobo, you're not.  if you cut the cheap lining you'd be able to fit your stuff.but i couldn't even use the bag because it smelled so strongly of chemicals.  i couldn't get the stench out.  it isn't a smell that i can sort of tolerate, it's a smell that is toxic and makes me light-headed.  i do not recommend wasting your money on this purchase.the bag was late in arriving to me.  when i opened it i was hit with the toxic smell, and it's not even the actual size.  not to mention the material feels like cheap vinyl.  do yourself a favor and buy a different bag, it'll save you money and time.
126378	i read reviews & didn't pay any attention about smell issue some people said they had...bad decision on my part. it did smell it took me 2 months of constant spraying of febreze & lysol to get rid of it. after i got that problem taken care of its a good bag to run errands with, handles look cheap though & doesn't work as a shoulder bag. if had to do over would not get again.
126454	you absolutely can not go wrong with a pair of reef's. they are comfortable, durable and sturdy. and these were at a great price.
126543	i have been using army surplus bags for years and was looking for a decent new one that wouldn't get full too easily but that also wouldn't invite my stuffing it with crap. this bag easily fits those requirements. i like the option of using the smaller pockets for stuff that i tend to carry all the time but that i don't need clogging up the main pockets. the two inner pockets are truly pockets (not just a divider as i've seen on some bags, where things can slip underneath) and the zipper pocket allows you some added security. the buckle is strong and sturdy and i honestly tend to wear the bag without clasping it as the top flap is heavy enough to just lie on top (unlike in the picture, the flap actually covers the entire bag when you aren't carrying a lot of stuff.) i carry my wallet, a notebook, some pens, aspirin, my ipod and headphones, hand sanitizer, first aid kit, mints, a hat, change purse, chapstick, mirror, cough drops, and tissues daily and this bag fits all that and still feels spacious and practically empty! i like a bag that has a decent capacity when i need but doesn't look ridiculous when not full. if i want, i can still throw in a magazine, an umbrella, a bottle of water, and a sandwich. i can't pack for an overnight or load it with textbooks but it is perfect for daily use on crowded subways.
126549	true to size (i'm a true large and the shirt fits perfectly), but not superb like exofficio or other brands.  the shirt washes well in a hotel sink and dries quickly for those travelling.  the nocturnal blue color is very nice.  however, the shirt is made of polyester that looks and feels like polyester - not cotton - like some other brands made of polyester.  hence, a deduction of one star.  i think other brands may have one to two years of product ahead of this as far as looking and feeling like cotton.
126551	i use this cleaning solution in my rayne ultrasonic cleaner and i get fabulous results with my rings, necklaces, and bracelets. sometimes i have to give the back of the stones a little light scrub with a toothbrush and some of the diluted solution before the ultrasonic cleaning if they're really dirty, but i would think that is normal. this was an incredible deal on six bottles, too. very satisfied and would highly reccomend.
126596	"i was looking for a light-weight, quick-drying, sun-protective shirt for a trip to africa.  the cost of ""safari"" shirts was outrageous.  this ""fishing"" shirt had all the advantages at a fraction of the price.  the only reason a gave it a 4-star instead of a 5-star is some quality problems.  the buttonholes are not completely cut open.  i had to pull out my seam ripper and finish cutting them to get the buttons through.  it's fixable, it doesn't detract from the shirt after i made the fix, but i would appreciate a little better quality work on the shirt."
126601	i bought this for the hot desert weather.  it is definitely very light and breathes through the mesh vents on the back.  unfortunately the white is a little see through, so i wear a tank top under and leave it unbuttoned.  i still love the shirt and even bought one in another color.
126610	this is a light weight vest which i presume was made for purposes of traveling. at least that's the reason i bought it. i compared it to a scottvest travel vest and i chose the columbia vest because it was cheaper and more stylish than the scottvest. the fit is a bit snug. i wear 42r in suit size and went with xl because i wanted a looser fit and some room to carry stuff. i can't give it 5 stars because it's a bit lacking in design.  it has 2 hand pockets, 4 zippered pockets and 1 flap pocket on the front, and 3 pouches on the inside. it sounds like a lot but when you're carrying a wallet, passports, cash, hand sanitizer, ipod, iphone, and a bose earphone, you start running out of places to put things. the pockets are not bellowed so the items bulge out and imprint. the inside pockets don't have zippers. i can carry a kindle without a cover in the inside pocket but once again it imprints. there is no way to carry a full size ipad. i think they need to add a pen pocket, a few bellowed pockets, a map pocket in the back, make the inside pockets bigger with zippers  and a few d rings would also be helpful--a d ring up top to hold sunglasses, a d ring on the sides, and a couple epaulets to hold camera straps or binoculars.
126635	i have worn this particular style and brand for many, many years.i live in the tropics and with light weight is most welcome.
126642	"i love these shorts!  they are perfect for hiking, staying cool, and for just hanging around the house.  i like that they are roomy enough that i can wear them without being aware of any extra ""baggage"" hanging over the waist line.  the zippered side pocket holds my lip gloss and a few other small items. i wish i had more in different colors!"
126648	these shorts are very cute and comfortable. they get five stars because they are still soft despite being made out of quick dry synthetic material. i am a bit curvy through the hips and thighs and bought a large to avoid ending up with too-small shorts. i could probably squeeze into a medium, but i prefer an easier fit. my measurements are...  waist: 27 hip: 39if you are similarly built with a bigger bottom and a smaller waist, definitely go with the large or x-large depending on hip measurements. you can always cinch the waist in with the belt.
126690	frye boots are a real favorite of mine. i have a high instep and they are very comfortable. i can wear them all day and my feet never tire.
126729	as another reviewer said, these are not really bike shorts....with fanny padding. these are bike shorts in length alone. nice quality, great fit.
126749	the &#34;plush underwire&#34; in the item description is not an underwire, it's a tiny piece of fabric cording.not enough support for me.i'm sure it would be fine for yoga, but it's not going to work for running and i can buy that level of support and spend much less.this one's going back.
126862	i loved the idea of this bag.  i have lower back issues and now find a backpack is the most comfortable choice for carrying around  my stuff.  i'm a sucker for leather bags and when i saw this number i thought i'd hit the perfect bag jackpot.  for some this may be it but for me it fell a bit short.  firstly the leather was only so so quality.  it felt a bit thin and papery.  the color is gorgeous and with good care it would deepen wonderfully to a lovely honey color.  secondly the bag has hardly any depth.  this was a deal breaker for me as i like a roomy bag.  why is was made so thin i don't know.  thirdly the strap system can get a bit twisted.  it isn't an instantaneous conversion from shoulder strap to backpack mode as you need to carefully feed the straps or untwist them.  really wanted to love but it's going back :(
126875	pickers, be more alert!  two left wings does not make a very pretty pair.  i had to change the wire around but, the silver mark ends up facing out.
127057	the wallet has great pockets, but the zipper on the large horizontal pocket broke just five days into our trip.  what a disappointment.
127110	usually size 8 fits me fine, but these were tight everywhere.  had to return them.  too bad, since i like the style.
127120	having a wide foot, it has been difficult to find a comfortable boot.  the is the first time i found a style of clark boots that i like.  so glad i chose them.
127125	i normally wear a 71/2 or 8 so i  ordered the 8.  they were a little big but perfect with thick socks.  i bought these for everyday use and for work.  i stand all day at work and these never hurt my feet!  i love them and would buy them again.
127197	i bought these at a bogo sale locally. i bought this pair, a jaya, a komondosport ls, a komondosport, and a treksport(see my other reviews on those).this shoe is sized accurately to width and length. i wear a solid 41 in eu size(look on the tounge of your favorite athletic shoe in the eu section for this number).i like the tread on this shoe for running. just enough variance to make good traction on most road conditions.i like the simplicity of the design. the patterns are just printed on the material, not sewn. less points of potential blister rubs.clear toe rubber abrasion protection ontop of your toes.velcro strap to adjust fit.light breathable material.snug fit to the material itself.cons:while i have skinny feet, people with normal to wide feet might find the tightness of this design troublesome. my hubby liked this shoe the best look wise, but had to opt for the ls version(laces) because the material was just too tight on the top of his foot. and his feet seem pretty normal to me size wise.i find these shoes to be exactly what they should be & nothing they aren't. a good, solid running shoe that fits like a glove with good, all weather tread for road running. while they aren't my favorite in my stable of vffs, they are like that old reliable car that gets you to work everyday & yet never gets any afterthought. you don't think about it because it just is perfect.there really is nothing i would change about these shoes, which says something.a note on fitting the odd toes....i have a second toe that is longer than my first, by alot actually. in every other shoe i own, this causes me to need to size up a half size in us(so one number in eu). vffs are no different. my other toes might have a little extra room to move in the ends but this is my normal mode of operating so my feet are used to it. this causes me no issues in these shoes.vff has sizing info on their website about measuring your feet to the correct sizing. it's pretty spot on. just measure your longest toe(which might not always be your big toe!)
127203	bought these from another source due to price but wanted to review here.  these are by far my favorite style.  they arrived yesterday and fit like a glove.  love the lacing....seems to fit my narrow foot better.  i have a pair of see ya's that, up to yesterday, were my favorite but these surpass them.  i have a pair of sport treks's that i've never been able to wear comfortably...they don't give as much as these do.  i will probably wear the sport trek's as water shoes for fishing in the lake...they'll work for that i think.but these will be my go to dog agility shoes.  love them already and i've just had them for  1 day.  the sole is supportive but very flexible and like i said...feel like a glove for your feet.  definitely keepers.
127261	love this pair of shoes.  i wear them all day and my feet dont hurt!  they run a little big though (i always run between two sizes and i wish i had ordered the smaller size instead of the larger one).
127282	came on a timely manner, recieved in excellent new condition. via shipper. the clasp is a little odd shape and looks quite large in size for this bracelet. but it seems to be functional. i purchased 20 each antique silver clip lock beads to be used with this leather bracelet. you dont need the o-ring seperator. since it don't fit anyway. just use the silver clip to stop the bead
127310	i received this in just  4 days and i love the color and the looks!  i know from reading some comments that a lot of these were purchased for children...i am an adult - a &#34;senior adult&#34;  - but i like the lightweight carry-on because having to drag around a heavy one is just not for me. especially if i have to put it in the overhead bin myself - i'm too short to even reach that high, but i can just push it in the compartment, and the bright color will let me see which bag is mine right away!i have not used it for travel yet, but i will pretty soon.
127325	great luggage if you like pink. not sure why they dont list the interior color on the product description. this was purchased for my son...but he wont be carrying red luggage with pink polka dots inside.
127326	i was in the market for a hardshell spinner carryon with easily-identifiable color/design and this fit the bill.  i've just returned from a quick roundtrip with today with this carryon.  upon first review, i noticed that the parts were all in working order, but not of particularly high quality. i was quite disappointed with the interior lining: it's very thin nylon--thinner than your typical reusable nylon grocery bag. i packed the bag pretty full but did not need to use the expansion zipper and it fit in the overhead compartment well.upon arrival at my destination, i found that the nylon on the zip compartment had torn away from the zipper with no hope of repair because it had also started to fray.in packing up again for departure, i noticed that the zipper was not functioning properly as it was skipping teeth here and there. i had to unzip and re-zip at a slower and more deliberate rate.upon arrival at home, i found that the nylon on the zip compartment had deteriorated in a different area. i had packed this section very loosely given that it was already torn. however, a hole had developed in the middle of the pocket in a separate location, seemingly due to friction from a soft makeup bag in the main compartment.this luggage interior cannot handle wear and tear.
127368	"i probably should have realized that the color would be off when the photo of the ""blue nubuck"" looked exactly like the photo of the ""blue-green"".  i was looking for a turquoise/aqua flat.  the blue-green color wasn't available in my size, so i went with blue nubuck, which looked surprisingly similar to blue-green.  the shoes arrived quicker than i expected.  they fit great, but the color was definitely not turquoise/aqua.  the blue nubuck is more cobalt/royal blue.  they're really cute and seem comfortable, so i'm keeping them even though i won't be able to wear them with what i intended to wear them with."
127405	i ordered this dress, it came very quickly, love the way it flows and fits. the handkerchief silky feel makes you feel sexy. i would recommenend this dress.
127456	"i brought these to replace a pair of $50 ironman sunglasses, the solid plastic mold one or something or other. i spend the $50 because i thought they would be durable and last along time. they were great till i was playing soccer one day and i got brushed by a soccer ball, i barely felt it but the expensive $50 ironman snapped in two.i went online to get another pair since they had lasted me probably 3 years. then i saw these triathlon running sunglasses for around $5. ""i said wth i'll give them a shot"". it's better than spending another $50 on glasses to have them break. i figured if these broke no big deal i'll get another pair.i got these glasses in the mail a few weeks ago. they seem a little fragile, and the rubber on the right arm is coming off. other than that i think these are great for sports (you know, as sunglasses not as protective eye wear), if they break i'll just grab another pair. a little glue will fix the right arm. and when i play/bike/run/w.e i'm not worried if they break, or if i lose them."
127480	the size of this boot fit exaclty like a glove.  very easy to walk around in, has the feel of being wore in.
127520	i don't get the hype surrounding frye.  these boots are not lined, there is absolutely no tread on the bottom, and they are very, very stiff.i was expecting something great for the $348 price tag, i was not impressed.thank you amazon for hassle free returns. :)
127529	i love these boots, they are beautiful and well done, i currently own another pair of frye boots (size 6) that are a staple in my fashion closet. i ordered this boots after trying them on at a local store where they seemed too big for me, i thought that since i had tried a floor model the boots might have been stretched out. unfortunately, when i got them they were a huge size 6, there must have been a whole inch and a half from my toe to the tip of the boot. i think i'll try to order these in a 5.5 and see how it goes, amazon has an amazing return policy and its convenient for these situations with expensive items. yes, the frye boots are pricey but they are beautifully crafted, they are comfortable and will outlast many many cheap boots out there.
127602	update- down another size and now wearing the size large bra. currently a 34d or 36c. i also wanted to mention that the picture on the listing and name of the listing has changed since i ordered. the name of the listing when i ordered was- moving comfort women's aurora c/d bra. now is is moving comfort women's aurora bra. i would assume it just altered the name on the listing but if you are c/d you may want to check with the seller to make sure this is still the c/d version.original review- i recently dropped from a size 12 to a size 10(36d or 38c bra size) and most my large sports bras were getting a little loose... so i ordered a medium in this, big mistake! i also have a different moving comfort size large sports bra that is mostly true to size with other sports bras (maybe a little tighter), so this through me for a loop. i ordered a large and it was still way too tight, in fact the xlarge i finally ordered fit tighter then my size large sports bras (including the other moving comfort, calypso, i have). so i now have this bra for the next couple sizes down, lol.i don't have a uniboob problem in the xlarge size, although i do in the size large- so i wonder if other women who have mentioned that problem aren't victims of the very poor sizing of this model. i do think this is a very pretty bra. i like the thick straps, much more comfortable on the shoulders. i really like that it clasps only in back, no pulling off over your head. it supports well and i would certainly agree this is a good bra for high impact. three stars for the comfort, support, and being a very attractive looking bra (imo) lost two stars for the extreme mis-sizing on this model. that's a big deal when something is being sold online.i spent about 10 and half bucks on each bra, and think it was more then worth that. personally, i would probably feel it was worth spending up to but no more then $20 per bra as long as you are certain the size will be right for you.
127625	as a busy mom, i'm always looking for something comfy that i can wear all day.  these jeans are easily the most comfortable jeans i own, and believe it or not, they are flattering. these are a little warm, but well worth it for the comfort.
127626	i just love these pajama jeans.  i wear them everywhere just like i would regular jeans and don't think twice about it.  great fit and they feel so good on.  i have even ordered more.
127638	i have to preface that i purchased these to fly.  i have to fly to and from japan several times a year and i wanted something comfortable to wear.  enter pajama jeans.  not with that being said,  if i didn't want them to fly i wouldn't wear them.  they look more like navy blue sweats then anything else.  i'm a size 6 and i ordered a small.  they are a bit snug when you first put them on but other then that they seem fine.  i'm 5'2 so they are about a inch to long for me but if you are taller then 5'5 they won't it you.
127640	"these pants are pretty great. i was worried at first, but they wear nicely, are warm for the cold weather, and look great. they even fit better than my real jeans. i actually begin to think of them as real jeans after a while. i bought another pair and my teenage daughter even thinks they look great and wants a pair of her own!!! a teenager!! lol. they did well in the wash (i washed them with ""like"" colors per the instructions) and didn't loose shape or shrink. i am awaiting a light blue color, that would be perfect!"
127646	i love these jeans but they need to come in lengths ! i wear a petite so i had to hem mine and i hate sewing ! also, they are cut a little small to size.
127675	i splurged on a pair of kahtoola microspikes, which i'm very happy with, but since the glacier chains seemed to be a clone and were a quarter of the price, i bought them too, for comparison and to have a spare pair.the glacier chains reek. they smell like an old time garage/tire shop. they were not too bad after they aired out for a while (days) but if you're really sensitive about smells they still might bother you, like you may get a faint bit of the smell on your hands when you put them on.they work quite well. the biggest difference between these and the kahtoolas is the rubber part. the glacier chains don't come up as high on my boots/shoes whereas the kahtoolas have almost a wraparound grip. the rubber in the kahtoolas is softer and grippier, reminds me a little of those weird sticky stretchy rubber creatures kids play with (no idea what they're called, little creatures you can stretch out without breaking and they go right back to their normal shape). i think there is a lot more chance one of the glaciers could pop off while walking.cannot speak to longterm quality at this point.i think these are a much better choice than the coiled kind that are more easily found in stores. i wear ladies size 7.5 and the medium is a good fit. i just noticed they included a few extra metal connectors in the bag (not the chains or spikes).
127705	product fit great and was just right for our ring bearer. the item seemed to be of quality material and looked very cute.
127716	it's really beautiful in person.  the picutre makes the color look a little dull but the pink is vibrant and the crystals sparkle.  what a lovely watch and a lovely way to support the cause.  highly recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
127725	i love this watch.  ordered it some time ago and just wore it.  the battery died within a few days but here's the catch, they included a new battery in the box.  problem solved.  the watch works just fine.  it's a cheap watch (price) but it works just as well as my $800 watch.  okay, maybe not but darn it, for less than $10, what do you expect?  it looks good and it's for a good cause.
127733	this coat is very nice quality.  it has a cloth liner inside, so that it can also function as a light fall coat or windbreaker.  my daughter is a tall 2 year old and the 3t fits well, with some room to grow.  as a bonus, she loves the design and asks to wear it whenever she can.
127801	this one is not for me i have a medium pouch and it makes my pouch look bigger however i like the material.
127848	i bought this to protect myself from the sun in outdoor swimming pools. i am generally a size s, but always buy a medium because i don't like things too tight even if they are supposed to be. this is tight (which is how it's supposed to fit). the color is nice and it seems to wear well.
127923	there is no question that bulova and many watch companies have made very few watches that are automatic watches for ladies, considering that it has been more popular for men for the past several years. but they have finally caught on with the times, and women are finally starting to make automatic watches their one and only one timepiece. this bulova heart aperture dial in a nice two-tone bracelet is absolutely clever and dainty. it definitely flows brilliantly in its finish, with leaving less than a skeletal face on the watch, while only showing the balance wheel in motion while you wear the watch. i like the design of it, and it works very well for bulova watch seekers. yet, my only gripe is that i wish it had better water resistance to meet up with brands like invicta and sthurling. still, bulova knows what it does to make great watches, and this is a excellent buy.price: b 1/2+convience & setup: b+overall: b 1/2+
127956	july 2, 2012 update: i'm lowering the rating from 3 stars to 2 stars, as one of the black eye crystals has fallen out.  this has been worn very rarely, perhaps only 4-5 times, and crystals should not be falling out.original review from february 21, 2012:the pendant itself is very nice, no issues so far.  on the chain however, the nice lobster claw catch is attached with a tiny link that is not soldered closed.  after wearing for 2 days, this link opened slightly, not surprisingly, and the chain fell off.  this link should have been soldered closed, because, as they say, a chain is only as strong as it's weakest link.
127960	great quality, well made but too tight. i normally take a size large but have bought isotoner one size gloves before. these are a bit snug though.
127988	i really like this skirt. it is a mid weight 100% cotton fabric, ankle length, a-line skirt with pockets and elastic for stretch onpart of the waist. it comes in several shades of denim. even though it is a size 12 wide it fits well and is so comfortable. iwould highly recommend it.
128001	"i purchased 3 of these bigshirts ""crystal blue,ocean wave & orchid bloom washed them in warm water (in the washer) gentle cycle dried them in the dryer on low and had no problems at all no holes! i am 5'4 also and the sleeves are f.i.n.e...the buttons stay buttoned... the flannel is light weight ....yes but i don't like heavy weight fabrics it's to hot for me...little if any shrinkage!! happy customer!!"
128058	nice color, fit and sizing.  if you like a cotton nightgown you can not go wrong with this one. excellent.
128075	...and i ordered a size up just to be sure after reading reviews here.these are not denim, they're twill.the construction of the pants are surprisingly good, but that's the only good thing i can say about these.why, oh why do i torture myself ordering from woman within a couple times a year?  i know, sometimes i get sucked in by the picture of them looking exactly the way i expect it to fit, or the fabric to be just as described...lucy pulls back that football every single time i go to kick.i normally wear a 14, but knowing that ww run small (which really sucks for a business that directs it's business to us plus-size gals) so i ordered a 16.runs very small, not just a wee bit small, but this fits (assuming i could zip them up) like a 12. no way would these ever be considered even a 14, let alone the 16 the label says.
128082	be very careful when ordering. they fit when i received them, but after washing they are now to tight to be comfortable.  won't be ordering clothes online any more.
128107	after first reading other reviewers ibdid order one size smaller. it is just right.for those looking for softness in fabric. stitching that does not cause discomfort to sensitive skin, especially if you are dealing with illness this shirt is perfect. i use it as lounge and or sleep shirt. it's pretty and comfy. it's not winter outdoor shirt but perfect indoors in any season. this is the first one i ever bought. i just ordered more from woman within.
128116	great pants!!!! i have retuned to buy more items from this store.  these pants lean a little more toward one size smaller, so order one size up when ordering.
128161	light fabric and runs a bit large...........love the colors and perfect for florida heat & humidity..............would recommend this top to anyone........
128165	buyer bewear this is a ugly potato sack no shape at all!!! the model in the picture must be a size 2 returning asap one angry x customer.
128177	just because someone is wide in the hips doesn't mean they have a huge waste, huge arms. it's way too big and when i fold up the sleeves...they will never stay up. it's hard shopping for something that fits you just right when you are a curvy petite plus size girl. that even sounds strange.
128178	this henley runs a little large, but it makes it that much more comfy!  i really love the slits on the side of the sleeves.  i hadnt noticed them when buying.  they make it a bit more stylish.  i like to wear henleys in cold weather as a layered look.  this way, my top blouse sleeves are rolled back to show the henley, so the upgrade look of the slit is nice.
128204	when i come home from work, i like to shed my business attire, soak in a hot tub, and put something comfortable on. something that i can answer the door in or lounge outside without feeling like am i wearing a night gown.these loungers are perfect...the material is lightweight, perfect for warm-weathered florida, and soft. the colors are vivid--not at all washed-out as another reviewer mentioned, probably different dye lots. in fact, i prefer the white with floral trim over the pink because the pink is a bit too vivid for my taste. the pockets are deep and handy. and the styling is attractive--i don't feel like i am wearing one of grandma's &#34;dusters&#34;i ordered one size smaller than usual--if i order more, i will order two sizes smaller.  they definitely run big.
128211	i returned this dress, the fabric was washed out and not clear and cheap!  they charged me $7.50 to return it!
128259	this is a perfect lounger! soft, comfy and roomy! no buttons or snaps to lay on , just soft cottony comfort. . washes up well, minimal shrinkage and retains its shape. i want a couple more!
128318	bought this to go along with the pants that i ordered for my mom.  the sizing information was spot on and the shirt is now only comfortable but washes up great.  i would recommend this top to anyone who enjoys being comfortable and looking good at the same time.
128329	the shirt runs big, i am 5'4 145 lbs and the large is too baggy. i like the summer weight material.i have it on at work today and will wear it, returns are too annoying. the sleeve lenght is short, which is nice, but i wear it rolled up. will most likely buy another one if it launders well. hoping no iron  needed.
128330	this is a cute shirt, quite a bit bigger than i expected. looks like i will be able to wear another shirt under it for another layer.
128365	this looks like a mumu on... i look bigger with it on than without... this is definitely not worth it!
128379	the elastic in the arm bands is a little tight and kind of annoying if you have any arm hair/peach fuzz to be seen.  it's also an irritating material, i find myself pulling on the sleeves a lot when i wear this to reposition it on my skin, but it looks nice on, and is a nice length.
128386	this was stark black brand new. good to wear for casual events. after 30 washes it's only good for around the house :(
128395	the robe fits very well, the color  (in my case blue) is very nice, but a little lighter than the picture.  it is warm and soft.  it is not a robe to use in mid-winter in the far north.  it is fine if the furnace is on and and there are no draughts.
128397	love these robes. just ordered a second one.not a thin flimsy robe and grat pockets for cell phoneswashes dries like a dream
128421	the size i ordered, which should have fit me according to measurements, was way too large.  also, i returned the skirt and still haven't recv'd the replacement skirt i ordered last month.  woman within is very slow in sending out reorders, apparently.
128444	this is super comfortable, and i'm developing a bad habit of wearing it whenever i'm home.. this is bad because it looks like a moo-moo.
128477	i bought them in brown last year and finally got a black one in my size this year.these go fast! fit my long legs perfectly, but a the material a little one the thin side.the brown ones show cellulite for big girls, or pear shaped girls. don't have that problem with the black.wash well. faded a little with first 3 washes. elastic still intact after a year.
128480	"i bought the size 1x in black about a year ago and i still wear them and they get washed about once a week or so. they fit me very nice - all the way down to just below my ankle - not too tight so i can wear them anywhere. i love the way they make me look slimmer. i am about 5'9"" and wear size 18 or 20. they look great in ankle boots but i usually wear them with black flats. the only thing i dont like is the price because if they were less i could buy more. im going to try the purple ones this time."
128494	this is a great lounger you can wear out. top is extra long and runs very big, you could go down a size unless you want it baggy. this was way cheaper than same set on ebay. i would get it.
128531	i got these capris last year and got more this year. was up good fit true to size color great!
128534	like these capris but they do run big.  so by the time you wear a bit and they stretch out...very baggy.
128606	because i want cotton nights with 3/4 or half sleeves, i ordered this. once i got it i cut the neck out to open it up a little. the cotton is poor quality and itches some. i still wear it because it breathes when it's hot.
128620	i bought two of these because they were just what i was looking for.  i use one as a pool cover-up and it's great.
128622	this is perfect for an upcoming stay in the hospital. there is nothing to trip on and the zipper is easy and fast.
128653	oh my gosh i love this top!  it fit perfectly and the material is nice and soft.  i love the extra long length.  it looks so nice on, especially with jeans, but looks nice with slacks as well.  the color is such a nice soft yellow.  was a bit wrinkled from packaging but pressed out beautifully.  recommend it highly.  i am considering ordering in another color as well.  the top arrived several days ahead of schedule, which seems to be happening with most amazon sellers, and is always a nice surprise.
128683	"this tunic is made of excellent quality, very smooth, almost silky feeling cotton. great quality.  it's also stitched very well. the neckline is flattering, nice sleeve length, and very cool and comfortable for easy casual dressing. it's tagless, like many of woman within's cotton tops.  the fit is not oversized and slouchy. it's a true tunic length for women of average height...5""4 to 5""6.i've purchased several pieces of cotton clothing from this seller. all are great quality that have minimal, if any, shrinkage with machine washing and drying.  sizing is consistent.  the transaction was smooth, with speedy delivery by ups. i'm pleased with this seller.  woman within is lane bryant's catalog division. i like their clothing. most is simply styled, non fussy, good quality cotton at great prices.  i usually shop lands end, but decided to try out this company for spring/summer clothing.  their cotton quality is every bit as good as lands end, without the hefty pricetag.  thanks woman within"
128698	these are just what i wanted. being all cotton, they do shrink in length a little so keep that in mind when ordering. but i'm pleased.
128801	i'm a big girl and finding clothes that cover all the 'pudge' and yet don't hang like a gunny sack is challenging.  this top has a nice neck line and the color is nice, but its boxy and unflattering and though big, i do have a figure....that unfortunately this shirt hides.
128805	doesn't look anything on me like it does on the model.  that's why i am disappointed.  i thought it would be slightly longer, but its big and blousey.  would not purchase again.
128837	i have people demanding that i get them this handbag. it's unique and goes with almost any outfit. it's a nice way to dress up a casual outfit and stand out at a gathering. definitely worth the money!
128857	these are sooooo pretty.  i wear them all the time -- they are great to add a little extra bling to an otherwise ordinary outfit.  not heavy, v.comfortable.
128888	these are my second pair. they are very comfortable to walk and run in although i would recommend another shoe for running. i'm not sure why i bought a second pair of these when my other ones got worn out because other shoes out there make these seem dated. i like the look and everything but i think there are nicer shoes out there.
128893	i put these warm, soft, comfortable slippers on every morning!! i actually look forward to it, as i have nerve damage in my feet and am in great pain and my feet feel like ice! highly recommend these wonderful slippers!
128895	this is my second pair and like the first they quickly become very matted down on the bottom and not much insulation value.  i wear them with thick socks and still i'll need to add an extra insole to wear them in winter.they do have a soft bottom, which wears out quickly.  but for the price and the comfort, i'll still continue to buy them.
128986	"these were comfy to wear, very cozy and i didn't want to take them off... perfect layer with long sweater and boots, or if you are really prone to getting cold then you can layer under jeans etc... i think they worked great with my boots, and felt very soft next to my skin. unlike wearing regular tights these did not bind at all. suggest hand wash and hang dry inside out with a little bit of fabric softener in the sink to keep them super soft.i am a size 12 and the m/l works great, and probably just the right length for my 5' 3"" frame. i still have plenty of scrunch room though, so up to 5' 7"" or so would probably be a good fit length wise as well."
128988	bought the m/l as i am 5&#34;7 and a size 8 they are too short and they had a hole in them??? very dissapointed will not buy again. however, if you have short legs and are anorexic they will fit just right......
129060	i purchased this shirt for my wife as a stocking stuffer... (we love the big bang theory and have big stockings...)  she loves it and wore it on christmas day after opening it.  she said it was roomy and comfortable.  it looks great!!!
129063	love these t shirts that are very soft--and this is one of them.  big fan of bbt so of course this shirt is a favorite.
129097	bought this for my self, but it was too large and my dad wanted it, so it became a gift, but not before i had time to look it over and check it out.color: first, the od is just gorgeous. the picture on amazon is a little washed out. it's actually almost exactly the green springfield uses on their fully loaded operator 1911s or the duracoat aug green color.material: the material is light-medium weight but warm enough from what i can tell--it's april in arkansas, so right now there's not a lot of cold to test it against. the inner light fleece lining is very soft, and i think it will do well trapping some extra heat as the shell reflects some heat back and repels water. note, the jacket is not water proof per se. the material is designed such that all of the pores are much smaller than water droplets, but if you're in a really soaking rain, some water will seep through, or so the tags and a friend of mine who's had his longer say.fit/size: i'm 6', 180 lbs and a medium is perfect for me. since i got this one in large, it works for my dad who's more along the lines of 6' 200 lbs.amenities:pockets, pockets, and more pockets. there are two handwarming pockets with a decent amount of room. each sleeve has an upper arm pocket (both with d-rings also) that's perfect for an ipod, cell phone, extra mag(s), gps, etc, and the left sleeve has a forearm pocket that's very similar. all outside pockets are zippered with small paracord pulls. there are also excellent inside pockets.the sleeves have velcro adjustable cuffs so you can keep wind out and position the sleeves at a comfortable height. though the picture doesn't show it, the closers are black, which is so much better than the od on the picture. they really accent the jacket well.the waist has a drawstring with retainers on each side of the front, so you can adjust the waist to your needs based on rain, wind, fit, and look. i find that the jacket fits at my waist perfectly, but others may want to adjust.large zippered vents are located under each arm. these are not mesh vents like you might find on a motorcycle jacket. they are unimpeded, completely open vents. you simply unzip and temp inside your jacket drops quickly. they are pretty large too, so you can get some decent cross-vent going.the hood does add some bulk to the neck, but i don't think it's as bad as a lot of people have said.summary: so far my dad loves it. if it spontaneously combusts or something, i'll update this review.
129132	this is a great watch.  i have had it for almost a year and haven't had any issues with it.  it is definately a large watch, but nothing so obtrusive that it is difficult to wear.pros- the build quality is great and the band being made of titanium makes the watch incredibly light overall.- the watch is an automatic and will continue running for about 2 days prior to stopping- i work in a machine shop and have banged the watch a few times without seeing any scratches.cons- not at this time that i have seen.
129144	great value and i would probably buy again.  but, when compared to nice (real nice) leggings like me moi, these are just... well they are just support pantyhose without feet.  they do not get snags or runs like pantyhose so that's a big plus!
129353	i previously owned the crocs patricia i sandal which is very comfortable, but the strap closest to the ankle was a bit loose which wasn't as flattering.  the new patricia sandal has slightly different straps which i find to be more flattering.  it takes a few wearings to break in the wedge to get more arch support and for the straps to loosen, but i find they are incredibly comfortable and look better on.  i wear a 6.5 and bought a size 6 which is my normal crocs size and they molded to my feet perfectly.
129418	i bought this sweatshirt for my husband and he really likes it.  we're already into fall now and we've had some temps in the 40's in the early mornings so he's already worn it.  it's soft and comfotable and the fit is good.  it washes up well and didn't fade.  i'm sure he'll get lots of use out of it this winter.  i actually bought seven of these sweatshirs all in different colors.  it'll keep him warm and toasty as the temps drop.  i definitely recommend it.
129482	true to size. soft medium- weight fabric. bold large letters. very happy with the quality. bought it for an uncle who is on a restricted low fat diet for health reasons, but he'd throw down for some bacon. made him smile!
129500	this jacket meets our expectations.  totally rain proof, a bright color which can be seen in a crowd, great fit.  what more could you want.
129537	i was deceived by the picture. it looks like it's an actual shoe with a back to it, not a slipper. but, they turned out to be like slippers, hence the return.
129571	i purchased this pair at the walking company and these hurt my feet really bad, they are very heavy and hurt the top of my feet, i hear that you need to break them in, i have had these for over a year and they still hurt even if i put on a pair of thick socks. this is very unfortunate considering i paid over $100 for these, what a waste of money.
129590	my husband wanted a pair of summer merrell's.  i got these and he hated them.  not enough back and too dark a color (he said not light colors).  still think anything merrell is terrific.
129599	i bought this to wear during games as a soccer referee. it is fantastic. i got through a 21-degree-fahrenheit game under windy conditions, and i was quite comfortable through the entire 90 minutes (well, my upper-half was, anyway!). would definitely recommend these.
129668	true to size, great price.  my husband has been wearing them for a couple of months now and they still look and feel great.  would recommend to a friend
129718	own just about every color of these shirts . very comfortable shirts . great for everyday wear or even better for working out .
129800	if you like walking around like a kindergartener with your untied shoe laces flapping around, then purchase these. your favorite tennies will lite up the night though. if you don't want to trip while you are dancing however, take them off and hang them from the ceiling.  they will make a great disco ornament.  just make sure you tie them to the rafters with real string, not the shoe laces which are made of a rigid plastic tubing which does not stay knotted or tied.  the depiction gives the illusion that they are flexible and soft like regular shoe laces. not only were they difficult to thread but they wouldn't even stay tied!  the idea is so cool: light-up shoes even for an adult! i bought these for my boyfriend as a gift.  he loved them but has never been able to wear them. so...buyer beware.  these shoes aren't made for walkin.
129839	i have had standard hip/fannie packs in the past which were fine.  they annoyed me sometimes when trying to get into my side pants or shorts pockets to get my money clip.  the pacsafe is a good design because it goes over one shoulder (reversible) so it doesn't block your side pants or shorts pockets.  the over the shoulder design is hard to find as i've been looking for quite some time.  it has plenty of built in security features and it is very well made.  and after all, how do you resist a product for which the color name is tabasco.
129876	the shoes look good, but they fit a little tightly across  the top of the foot, so i am using a shoe stretcher to give the pinch more room i need for them to fit right.the color is good. they seem to be well made and the height is not too high or too low.
129921	the only problem was that the size runs smaller than i thought. it was fine and i gave it to my friend for her birthday and she just loved it and wore it out the next day and got so many compliments on it. i would like to get another one but in a larger size.
129927	i know this shirt has gotten mixed reviews but i really like it. i haven't had any problems with the lace and i get lots of complements when i wear them. it is important to size up a bit.
130001	i purchased this particular seiko for the following reasons:=============================================================i'm a diver and needed a 200 m watch that is reliable. i have several seiko watches that have seen dives below 100 feet and none of them have ever failed.the solar charging system is the way to go.  the less often you have to open your dive watch, the better off you are.unfortunately i have had watches go bad because the watch store failed to seat the o-ring properly or failed to tighten the case!the price:  very reasonable for a quality, elegant, 200 m, stainless steel watch.if you are seriously considering this watch, i say .........buy it with confidence!!update 06-19-2012:===================just returned from a scuba diving trip to mexico and the deepest dive registered 136 feet on my computer.the watch performed flawlessly!!
130063	"these shoes were really nice as i searched for the word ""comfortable shoes"", so i ordered them. just a note, they are very narrow. if you have wide feet, like me, they will not fit. i take and ordered a size 8-1/2 us and couldn't even get my foot in past my toes. very nicely made but a shame they don't have wide sizes. amazon was amazing with the return with no issues - kudos to amazon! on a better note, i ordered a pair of clark sandals from amazon in wide and they are awesome and spongy comfortable! amazon also does an incredible job with shipping!"
130121	new balance are the best shoes for problem feet, and this pair fit perfectly.  we tried to bend them, like the old pr and they are so sturdy, they wouldn't bend.
130169	most people say this bag has a smell when you get it, it does.  i open the bad and threw in a few drier sheets and a bar of iris spring soap still in the box (u can use any soap in a box) zippered the bag up and left it for a about a week and the smell was gone.  this is a great bag.  it has plenty of room to store a lot of clothes and plenty of outside pockets.  this makes a great over night bag, traveling bag, or hospital bag for having a baby
130174	i bought these booties for a friend who is pregnant with her first baby girl. i loved the little pink bows, and my friend loved them too.
130282	i bought 2 of them -red and black- in one size plus.i'm 5'7 38 ddd, 180 pounds, 36 inch waist and it fit me like a glove. i have like 10 fishnet sexy outfits from amazon, but this one is your sure bet.stretches amazingly, well-made - it looked to me like it may pop at the bust couple times but it didnt.i'm at a loss of words at describing how amazing it looks and feels.absolutely and definitely recommended! it's so malleable and stretchy it could fit couple sizes up or down from mine.
130354	these shoes stand up to abuse. i've been wearing the heck out of them since i got them. i bought the ones on sale so the color and style are not really to my tastes but i quickly got over it after wearing these.what i like: they are extremely breathable, they have that slim/barefoot technology that i love, they are easy on/easy off.i would compare these to a pair of sketchers i got in gray/black that had the same slim profile. the merrells are more comfy and more &#34;breathable&#34;. i prefer these for actually walking in. they're good for travel - forget hollywood, you need to be wearing good shoes in case of emergency! i would be interested in trying other styles in their line. i just didn't want to spend alot of money until i had tried them out.
130372	i'm new to the minimal style of sneaker, but i really like these.  they're a bit snug in my usual size, so i can't wear socks with them, but they're comfy and tough.  it did take a bit of adjustment wearing them, as your foot muscles have to behave differently.  i've also received compliments on how cute they are, which isn't necessarily a requirement in a workout/running shoe, but is a nice plus!
130410	if you want a liitle sex appeal, but still need to dress professional. these work great. down side a little itchy. i found if you use a small amount of face powder, it helps.
130475	i have this problem with other green toys - they are cute, seem well made, but they don't roll on wood floors or tile very well.  wheels seem stuck.
130502	i ordered this bra to wear under my wedding dress. it is very comfortable, smooth under clothing, and stays up pretty well for a strapless. i am very pleased with this bra. and it does add 2 cup sizes, which is great.
130536	i ordered the the dress in my size according to the chart.  it was far too big, especially in the bust (i am very evenly proportioned). it is very flattering for larger figures, even if it is too large for me. the dress is very well made with a beautiful satin finish and lining.  the dress is heavy, best suited for cooler months.  shipping was very fast- 3 days.  i have to exchange the dress for a smaller size. i am not sure about the return/exchange policy... it has to be &#34;approved&#34; byt he company.  i paid only $39 for the dress in teal. now i have to exchange it and it is out of stock in a smaller size in teal.  the prices changed over the course of 3 days. the other colors now cost $88.  i am wondering if they will do an even exchange.  if they do not exchange it for a smaller size at the same price, this could be a deal breaker for me. i will keep you posted on the exchange process.
130545	"feels comfortable and warm. i'm 5'10"", 170lbs, and i got an xl. it's roomy but not too big. love it!"
130551	this hoodie does run small. i recommend getting one size up. i always wear a medium and got a large because of the reviews... glad i did. that said, i love love love everything else about it. great quality and fit!
130611	i ordered this to compliment the calla lily necklace.  i was not expecting the most fantastic ring at the price but was quite surprised.  for the price, it is really very nice.  i know i will enjoy wearing it.
130627	36a is more like 32a.  it was so tight, i can barely breath.  should've looked at the reviews.  seller should definitely put that in the description.  fit small!
130655	the watch is much much more beautiful than the picture. i'm not exaggerating. i get compliments on this watch all the time. you won't regret buying it!
130688	my husband loves the fit of keen shoes--he has a very high instep and very wide feet, and keen shoes seem customized for him. these shoes are great if you work in conditions where you're on your feet a lot, and don't know what to expect from your work environment--water, soot, grease, sparks--they handle all of that an d still look great.because the footbed is so stable, he doesn't miss the ankle support a more conventional work boot would have. work boots actually bother his ankles a bit because his bones stick out so much, and these don't rub them. i would highly recommend keen's if you're on your feet a lot and have high arches, and these in particular if you work in some kind of fabrication setting, like an artist's studio, welding shop, hot glass studio, or kitchen.
130691	the keen boots were exactly the colour and style as indicated. they are a lightweight hiker and like all my keen shoes/boots i can put them on and go walking without having to wear in them in. the gypsum are waterproof and when i unexpectedly stepped into a water filled hole my feet stayed perfectly dry.i wear a us 9 and i found that that the sizing was pretty accurate, though after a couple of days they did feel more roomy than my other keen boots. this was remedied by a slightly thicker pair of socks.
130716	"why oh why can't you make boots that really work for wide calves.  i have reviewed two previous pairs of keens that seemed to promise they would fit wide calves and they didn't.  but because frankly i love keens, i gave you another chance.  i believed in your this time, but no mas!  it wasn't meant to be.  these boots supposedly fit 16"" calves.  i have 15"" calves and i couldn't get these zippered past the middle of my calf.  yes, that's as far as i could get them.  perhaps the 16"" is on a women's size 11.  i ordered a six.  i measured the calf circumference and it is only 14.5"".  again, like with the others i tried, the boot is narrow from the ankle and mildly widens as you move up the shaft.  mildly.  keen, do you realize that a calf muscle is more than a single band right below the back of the knee?  because you let me down so many times this season, i was tempted to give this boot one star,but my conscience wouldn't let me because, darn it, the boot is great.  the sizing just isn't.  keen, please think about us wide calf gals when you make boots for 2013.  we are feeling disenfranchised and ignored yet we are so loyal to you. i have to return these boots too."
130877	these shoes took me two weeks to break in and get used to and now that they are, they fit me like a glove and i can run forever in them.they are really flush with your foot, and thats the point of barefoot running. if this idea is not appealing to you then you wont like these shoes... my boyfriend would hate the style, but for me they are perfect. i have a high arch and these support them well.it wasnt that the shoe was uncomfortable for the first two weeks, but its presence was well known, almost to the point of it being annoying. when i broke them in and ran a few times they loosened and i got used to the feel and now they are one with my foot.i run on treadmills or on the street and these work well for both. they stay with my feet and are light and sturdy and i love the hug.there is a tag that says that they will add strain to your ankle and calf, for a benefit and ease into them. i dont know about that as i didnt notice any additional strain, they would make excellent trail shoes as they let you feel the movement of your foot and therefor are great for mixed levels of earth pavement.i think they are kind of cute. they make my foot look a little smaller but also cute... my boyfriend comments now and then how much he likes the way i look in them.we have a rock wall at our gym and these are so perfect for that activity! light, flexible and close fittingi love love love them!
130966	i bought these in black and grey off another website since they were on sale.  the grey is very cute, but looks like i'm going snowboarding.  i might still keep those.  the black ones look ok, but the zipper sticks.  there is a gusset that keeps water from getting between the boot shaft and the tongue, but it only goes up to about the ankle bone.  something about it catches the zipper on both the left and right boots when unzipping.  i can't figure out what is catching.  after ziggling and wiggling things about, my foot is untrapped and can get out.  the zipper on both grey boots works just fine.they are comfortable, but there is a slight bulge in the sole that feels like, say, an arch support, but on the outer side of my feet.  it's a slight bulge.  but between that and the sticking zipper, i'm returning the black boots.  if one more person asks if i'm going snowboarding, haha, so clever, i'm returning the grey ones too.
130967	i wanted to love these boots. they were exactly what i wanted:1. insulated2. waterproof3. full zip, so i can get my (bulky, wide) orthotics in4. lace-up, so i can still have a custom fiti bought the off-white color (cheapest), which was actually a very nice buff/tan, not the screaming white it looks from the picture.unfortunately, even in a full size larger than my normal size, they are too narrow to fit my orthotics. back they go!
130993	a gift with another bead which made my sister very happy.  i'm rather fond of &#34;sparklies&#34; so it's perfect with the 'sis' bead.
131003	very happy i made this purchase, it looks great on the bracelet and fit perfect. hopefully we can do more business in the future.....
131020	these are some great quality carabiners, obviously they aren't for climbing. but they are great for keys and other such things.
131030	horrible shoe...advertised as turquoise, but it's blue. looks like cheap plastic. i returned it. very surprised that easy street would have such poor quality.
131085	just got a pair today.and will return tomorrow. my left foot is a bit smaller than the right and the right fit fine, but the left felt a half size smaller (at least). thought a few miles might stretch them a bit but no luck. will follow up because the right felt great and i like hem more than 5 fingers
131097	there isn't a glass or plastic cover! the cover over the clock doesn't have plastic in the windows. overall, it is a great watch. i got this for my younger steampunk brother as a gift and he loved it! it is a cool watch.
131102	i received the fossil stella watch in rose gold as a gift, and i love it. the size is substantial without being uncomfortably bulky. the band is smooth and comfortable. i get lots of compliments on the color.there is some wear on the clasp side of the band - likely from resting my wrist as i type. the wear on this rose gold plating is somewhat more noticeable than on my old stainless steel silver watch, but not a major issue. i'm sure i'm the only one who notices.beautiful watch!
131129	to start off... the product received looks very different from the picture on amazon.it is a soft shell, very pliable material, not a plastic mold.that being said it is a descent product. quality would rate around a 4 out of 5, as i'm sure this wouldn't make it through extended wear or even past two halloweens.if you are looking for an inexpensive prop/laugh, then this won't disappoint. would buy again.i buy over 250 items a year from amazon and always give an honest review in order to help those trying to make a purchase decision.this product rates 4 stars for use ability, construction and varying stock photo from actual item.
131233	these are so nice. the stones are beauties. they sparkle like crazy. diamond earrings couldn't be any prettier. the 4mm is equivalent to 1/2cttw; 3mm about 1/4cttw; and the 2mm is approximately 1/10cttw. these a are small earring with a big sparkle. there are so noticeable, i wear the 4mm  in my main piercings.  normally, i prefer a bigger stud, but these little earrings really pop. they are set in nickel free silver. the post are sturdy and the backs fit securely to the earrings. previously, i purchased a pair of the 2mm individually. i've shampooed and showered in them and they kept their beautiful sparkle.  neither has the silver tarnished.there are few sellers offering small cz studs for a penny; along with a 6.95 shipping charge.  i purchased a couple of pairs of those, too. these are prettier, with better quality stones.
131312	these shoes are super comfortable but i gotta disagree with the complaints about them being sized too large. i always buy the exact same size and did so with these as well and if anything they're a little snug. not enough to exchange them but enough that i'm handpicking the socks that i wear with them for sure.
131333	i purchased these shoes as well as the innov-8 x-talon 212's for use in two spartan sprints (with more to come) as well as trail running/training.  i have no doubt that the speedcross 3's are a great shoe for mud runs but i ended up returning these for reasons i'll get to momentarily.i did not try these shoes out on any runs so i cannot vouch for their performance on trails but here are my thoughts based on my limited time with them.pros- the shoes hug your feet quite comfortably and seem very secure. i felt like my feet were protected from anything and everything with these on.- grip is top notch.  the cleats on the sole are deep and clearly made to grip and release mud, dirt or whatever you run through.- lightweight. for a big shoe (mid-top/high-top shoe) this is surprisingly light.cons- maximum cushioning.  tons of cushioning on this to the point that you probably gain an inch or so of height wearing them, like wearing a pair of hi-top basketball shoes.  no way you will feel any rocks or branches when running these on the trails.  some may take this as a pro and, if so, this shoe is for you.  if you like to have a bit more feel on your trail runs then this is not the shoe for you.- thick shoes all around.  all parts of this shoe seem thick and substantial.  you feel secure in the shoe but these are not the type of shoes that disappear on your feet when you put them on.  the speedcross 3's are basically the anti-minimalist shoe.there are many good points to the speedcross and i would bet that for someone running long distance trails this is a perfect shoe.  i prefer a bit more feel when trail running, not minimalist per se but definitely towards that end of the cushioning spectrum.if you want a shoe that can take you through multiple mud runs and fight through mud, rocks and debris without your feet feeling a thing, this shoe is for you.  if you prefer a less is more approach to your shoes, try something else like the innov-8 x-talon 212s.overall: 4/5 i considered giving this 3 stars but the shoe is top quality and is a great cushioned shoe for trails, it just didn't fit my particular needs.
131341	these shoes look good on the web site but they run very narrow. so narrow that i couldn't get me foot into the shoe
131397	my boyfriend liked the color and thought these would be a good cushion slipper. he is still wearing them. they fit as expected. i guess 8 months is about the life span of a pair of slippers? makes an okay christmas gift.
131404	excellent buy.  not to expensive and very comfortable.  the inside seem will occasionally feel weird but mostly very comfortable slipper.
131473	i bought these boots for a winter in anchoreage,ak. i absolutely love them!! just enough room for thick socks and not bulky looking at all.
131474	i have a pair of sorel boots that are mid-calf and i love them. i wanted a pair of boots that were higher for scampering through higher snow accumulations without snow getting in the top of my boot. these boots fit the bill. the exterior is continuous with exterior lacing. there is a felt insert (that looked like something to pull out and toss with the packaging) that serves as the insulation. take that as you like. i think that what tuns off some of the negative reviewers. my other sorel has thinsulate lining and fur top. but they were more than $100. i think these boots are great for the money.since it doesn't have the thickness of my other sorel boots the foot part fits a little looser. i tend to buy these to allow for wearing thick socks.update: 1/4/14- wore these during the snowstorm in the northeast labelled hercules and they held up well. went to work, cleaned off car outdoors and walked dog without getting cold or wet feet. wore thin socks and sweatpants with elastic cuffs and another time with thick leggings and no problems. decent traction also. my mom wants a pair!
131537	i ordered a size 5m, which is my shoe size but these were too big. there was a smaller size available but i also thought the shoebox was too shallow for my taste, so i returned them.
131601	the shoe looks like the one in the picture but the size chart is too much generous with it. i espected my kid use it for a while but don't think so.
131620	i like full coverage and comfort, you get both with hanes briefs! use to be able to find them in walmart, but have had trouble finding them lately!
131661	i read some other reviews and most people agree jambu runs about a half size smaller than normal. i wear a 7 and have bought jambu clogs in 7 and they fit fine. however, i went ahead and got the 1/2 size larger in this shoe and was happy i did. i think my toes would have been at the end otherwise. these are adorable and i got many compliments.
131672	i normally wear a 10 or a 10.5 and though my toes hit the end of this shoe it's not uncomfortable.  i would prefer a 10.5 if jambu made the half size in 10 but they don't (jambu - you should change that!) but these are fine.  i think the faux fur helps cushion them so there's no issues in the toe box area.i will say the ones with the faux fur are warm so plan on wearing them on colder days! :-) the fur is on the top and sides only, not the bottom.  the bottom is the normal jambu padded insole etc.overall a nice design and a decent enough fit.  good comfort/arch support.
131732	i bought these boots for my trip to the arctic and they do not disappoint for warmth and comfort!  well structured, yet light and they definitely keep my feet warm and dry.  good traction on snowy sidewalks, too.i usually wear a size 8.5, but i ordered up and got a 9 so i would have room for chunky socks.  probably wasn't necessary, but i'm keeping the nines, as they don't feel uncomfortably large.  definitely have room for big wool socks if i want, though.the only complaint that i have is that the colors are a bit different than how they are pictured.  they are shown with dark brown soles and laces, but they actually came with bright orange soles and laces!  they look good, and i'm keeping them despite not being exactly what i thought i was getting, but the picture should probably be updated.
131754	i love these boots. they are true to size and very comfortable. they are also nice enough to wear when i go to town on cold wet days.
131849	we bought this for a raffle prize for our employees.  i was impressed with the looks of the watch - very nice - and it was one of the first items to go in our raffle.  that says a lot because our guys are picky!
131931	when i first tried this on, i wasn't impressed. i put it on again last night though, and it is very flattering. the fishnets are attached to the dress with garter-like strings and can be cumbersome, but it definitely adds to the entire look. the solid black midsection is a little wider than i would like and covers the entire abdomen, but the dress is still plenty hot.
131940	i'm 5'6', 150lbs, with little bit of a stomach. not in this. these stockings were perfect because they stretched for those that need length and could also be bunched up at the thigh just above the garter for a shorter leg. very comfortable and super hot on. stretchy and soft to the touch. the criss-cross pattern does not cut in to the skin. so the look is very smooth and sexy. no support in the chest. but this could be worn with a black bra that will totally fit in the look. most importantly i felt sexy in it which is the real goal of lingerie (to make the woman more comfortable with herself). very well received, i think these is a great option for several body types.
132003	this ring has a quality look.  it has the look i of a ring that would cost much more, and i am proud to wear it.
132100	i went by the size chart instead of my instincts and this top is too tight in the sleeve.  it is really cute, though, nice color and i love the length.  nice fabric that stands up to washing and doesn't need ironing.  if i lose a few lbs. the sleeves might fit.  i'm hoping.
132104	very pretty and floaty. beautiful color just as pictured. very comfortable to wear. i love the lacy edge. it makes this shirt a little special!
132112	these are just what i expected them to be and more.  i love the material, it is so soft andis great to go out in or just stay home and relax in.  i like how you can tighten the bottomsto fit where you want.  i would buy these again and if they have other colors, i just might!
132114	these run large so size down. i kept mine. i have a horrible habit of wearing pants too big plus for yoga comfort is the word and lord, these are amazing yoga pants!then, the way i wear them (big) they're great boyfriend cargo capris.i own them in black and grey and can't say enough good things about them.they wash really well too!
132118	when i received these earrings the package looked liked it had been run over and when i opened them the one earring was in perfect shape now the other was all torn up the cz was completely out of the earring and was all bent up! there was no possible way to wear them!
132195	great product. use it for bicycling and motorcycling. fits fine and the mouth guard can be pulled down without much fuss. smells good right out of the box! ok. most clothing does. why is that?! do they run it through the same shop as the new car interiors? what if they made deodorant that smells like that? axe new car smell or something. ... ... what was i talking about?? oh yea! the mask is good!
132198	this is true ua coldgear and works as intended... 2 notes, first: if you have a rather large head (i wear flexfit hats size l/xl) it will come up a bit short in the front exposing your throat a bit (so wear a scarf or if like me for tactical/hunting use, buy a ua coldgear shirt with a high neck -not crew). second: if planning on shooting with this over your nose, expect any eye protection to fog up regardless of what type. just take it off your nose to breath and shoot :)
132212	i was nervous about this purchase. the ring is beautiful and the price for the ring is fantastic. it is worth the buy. :)
132262	the ring is lovely, simple and classy. the silver is not thin at all, it actually looks like a more expansive ring, the way the silver goes up on the sides of the stone. the only thing that was a surprise was how high the stone setting is, on the picture it looks more flat, in reality it sits about half and inch up, so i don't plan on wearing this ring everyday. i purchased it to wear with light green pearl earrings, perfect color match. well worth the the small price!
132283	well since these don't come in half sizes i figured based on other reviews i'd go down in size (i'm about 8.5). but the 8s pinched my toes so i'm trading in for 9s now. wish they did half sizes.
132330	you get kind of attached to a wallet.  i had my last one for more than 10 years.  i'm very pleased with the quality of this wallet.  lots of room for credit cards and easy access to id.  very nice and at an excellent price.  i'm happy.
132381	i don't like big bulky wallets and don't carry a lot of things in my wallet. just the basics. i also carry a wallet in my front pocket or a jacket pocket. i am also a fan of easy-to-open zippered wallets. this wallet was great for me. granted if you try to overfill it then you'll have some problems, but i filled almost every slot and compartment and it fit perfectly in my pockets. i have other alpine swiss products and like them. this is a nice addition and another favorite product of theirs.
132493	my husband had got a bigger one before- he finds this one comfortable. and yes, there's no place for coins.
132638	i really like the alpine swiss wallets, they are a great price and real leather.  this is no exception, nice leather, doesn't smell like some of the wallets and pleather products.  these make great gifts, they look a lot more expensive than you have to pay--christmas is around the corner!
132642	first of all, the material is excellent leather, nicely shaped and four slots.  the slot for photo id can hold two items, then there is two outside slots that can hold at least two items, the inside slot can hold up to nine cards.  very useful, slim and comfortable.  there are other slim wallets, but this is one of the best and is the most reasonable as to cost.
132666	very satisfied with the product. these things are so comfortable and very warm so they are a great winter shoe.
132682	i have always had trouble with my feet.  they are wide.  it is very difficult to find a shoe that fits.  i find crocs to be very comfortable.  i am able to stand for hours with my feet not hurting.  but - crocs are generally ugly.  or so i am told by my wife and daughters.so i found these crocs on amazon.  they look very nice - my wife said so.  they are very comfortable.  others complained about the liner being hot, but i find that it is not.  my feet generally get sticky in crocs - skin to plastic contact.  but these crocs have a built in sock.  i think they are great!the folks who are complaining about the liner not lasting long should not wear socks with their crocs.  cloth rubbing against cloth will wear quickly.
132790	i bought this for my seven month old because regular headbands can be scratchy and tight. this one is smooth and not too snug. no red marks when i took it off and she didn't pull it off early, i'm assuming because it didn't bother her. it is sooo pretty! i got the pink one and it was exactly as pictured.
132921	these were a great deal at $19.99 with the super saver shipping.  this price is comparable to, or beats, macy's or penney's when they are on sale there.  more specifically, though, haggar is one of only a few brands that my husband will wear when he's golfing.  he is adamant about the expandable waist feature, and he liked the khaki color, a medium brown with grey overtones.  since these pants are never going to get ironed, i like the cotton/polyester blend because they don't wrinkle as badly as 100 percent cotton.  they wear well also.  my husband will get at least two golf seasons out of a pair, and that is pretty heavy useage.  then too, it's not easy to find the plain fronts, which he prefers and thinks these are stylish.  all in all, i scored big with him on this purchase.
132995	i got this and the margin to try them out. both this and the margin have the adiprene but it's not listed in both. i verified this with rockport support department.this shoe fits great and provides good support. i used it on several days a week (alternating weekly between this and the editorial). they are comfortable.
133011	i bought these for my husband, who works on his feet all day.  he absolutely loves the relatively low-profile look of them, and raves about the comfort.  evidently he's received many inquiries at work about them.  super stylish yet functional.  i'm sure this will not be my last rockport purchase for him.  and amazon had the best price, of course!
133043	these aren't anything special.  the lenses are so-so, but for a few bucks, we didn't expect ray-bans or anything.  they're what you would expect for $5, nothing more.
133053	these things are great.  for the price, the quality is good, and the look is as described- like the wayfarer.
133055	"invicta use to make mainly huge divers watches for a long time and their prices were outrageous but it seems like somethings changed, they actually are making watches that have basic simple shapes. they are going in other directions.this watch first caught my eye because its interesting details and simplicity i loved the way the band and the watch intersected. the clean lines and modern design is very similar to a nixon watch without the gigantic price that nixon charges for their watches (it wasn't always that way but that's another story). i noticed this was only $65 and i had to get it. when i got it i couldn't believe the big size and how heavy it was. it's big but not as big as their russian divers watch and it is thick around 3/8"" thick. another detail is the size of the hands and numbers, you can see what time it is easily and the numbers glow so you can see the time in the dark. one thing i don't understand is why they feel they have to put a date on watches anymore but this does have a date, the only thing that is funny is the date is microscopic compared to the size of the rest of the watch.i use to despise invicta watches because i always felt the designs were way too busy, they were way overpriced. they still have the busy watches but now they also have an alternative for people who like bold, simple and nicely priced watches."
133060	gran calidad sorprendido con esta compra reloj de alta calidad muy buen reloj para hombre gran tama&ntilde;o un estuche llamativo y un precio excelente por tan buen producto muy bueno recomendado
133081	the front of the shoe is very flat and wide. not sure why the velcro strap in the front is even there. i do not recommend this shoe but i do recommend the seller
133119	that's what my tag says! this is from china and english isn't dahlia's--the maker's--first language. nothing wrong with that, it's just why they have all that jumble of words on the name of the product and the tag.see my images to the right of the reviews. i really like this shawl and the images don't do it justice. i used the scanner and not a camera just to give you a close-up from both sides of the same design, the paisley flower. plus the edge with the tassels. the sparkle of the metallic threads doesn't come through but literally over most of the shawl, every 4th thread of the weft is a gold one. it's funny how red, green and gold are usually associated with christmas. that made it hard for me to pick which color. but i already have ones like the blue and the burgundy and i'm so happy i chose this one because it's different from the many others i own.there are several shades of green here from lime to grass to olive (i wouldn't like it if it were all olive green). the reds range from pink to burgundy. the gold threads on the yellow parts of the shawl, especially on the reverse side from the main image of the shawl above, really glitter nicely. plus there are enough areas with sort of light tan to peachy color which add nuance to the overall design. makes the shawl a little more sophisticated, i think.mine is light and soft and came in a fair-sized gauzy bag with a ribbon.  one little bitty white tag says dahlia and another little white tag right by it says 50% rayon 50% polyester with the laundry instructions. i find just about all my scarves and wraps are machine washable in cold water, on delicate, with a little detergent, and can be dried on low but taken out and hung up while still damp. (i learned the hard way a while ago to use shout color guard sheets in these loads just in case one isn't colorfast.)
133136	i not super hot but is not ugly at all is okfor the price feel ok too what i dont like islaces are untied all the time only happenwith this shoes maybe is the material
133152	this shirt runs a little small.  i ordered an extra large.  i wear a large.  the extra large fits perfect.  the shirt, although thin, is good quality.  i wouldn't hesitate to purchase another.  great for layering
133214	pretty watch, wears comfortably, though i do think it looks better in the picture than in person, which is not typically the case. not sure if the price was right for what i received is where i am at.
133229	love these boots... they go perfectly with my skinny jeans.  they fit true to size. love the buckle detail around the top.  great boots for the winter. simple and comfy!
133250	most flip flops i've owned break at the strap between the toes or the soles wear out thin at either the toe or heel quickly. this is my second pair of sanuk yoga sandals. my previous pair was the yoga mat style, which are nice but the straps on the serenity are not as wide so they look more feminine. i left my last pair out on the patio in the sun for over a month and they hardened so i had to toss them, other than that i had them for several months and wore them everyday in the dirt, to town, etc. and they still looked good, even the little logo on the heel didnt wear off. i noticed with this last pair that they say manufactured in china which is too bad being that they are working the reputation of being eco-friendy and all.5-9-12 edit: ok so these are already going to have to be tossed soon. they did not hold up as well as the last pair. the foam is tearing apart and has worn down thin at the toe. the materials cannot be the same as the last, because i didnt get near as many mile out of them and they look like hell. they must have been outsourced since the last pair i had, that would definately explain the poor quality. i will not be buying sanuk again.
133269	pros-cut stylecons-tiny top-not flatteringi wanted this bathing suit to fit right because the style is so cute...but the top is pretty small. i also didn't like the way the ruffle around the bottom fit...maybe i bought a size too small, but i bought my standard. i suggest that if you are in between sizes, then size up. returned it.
133331	when i purchased these i was desperately hoping that they wouldn't arrive and be the size of a bean. i don't know about you but i've spent good money on pearl tuxedo studs and by the end of the night i was missing at least one of them and since they don't sell them individually i basically ruined a nice tuxedo stud set. learned my lesson there.i purchased these and they arrived and they are a bit smaller than a dime. perfect size. these will not fall out of your shirt before the night is over and definitely add a nice pop to your tuxedo. this especially helps when you're at a black-tie event and most other men are poorly dressed in their tuxedos.pros:-great shine and luster-quality product. these look like they will last for quite some time-large enough so they won't accidentally fall out of your shirtcons:-none that i can think of...
133338	this is a pretty good workout shirt.  the material is not the most comfortable against the skin (polyester blend), but it's not uncomfortable and it wicks away sweat pretty well.  i discovered lululemon t-shirts after i got this shirt and they are much more comfortable to wear.  they are more expensive, but well worth it.
133405	the clog was very comfortable.  and a great fit width-wise for my 2a foot.  the small elastic gussets give the right amount of stretch to keep the clog on with ease.  however the shoe was 1/2 - 1 size short in the 12 with my heel hanging off the rear edge.  best to consider sizing up.  the black was a classic and looked expensive, too.
133515	there really isn't a whole lot more to say about this bracelet.  it's very pretty and looks great with many outfits.  i've gotten many compliments while wearing it!
133537	short socks- they work for me- will they work for you? try them & find out. these are good quality & seem durable-so far.
133552	i generally like these socks, they seem to be well made and stay up all day. the only issue i have with em is the fit isn't consistent across all three pairs. i expected more from carhartt.
133566	i ordered these in the wrong size i order them in a size i could never get my leg in had to send them back but they did not have my size and my money was refunded promptly.
133579	i love this item in black...hard to get on at first but once its on, it moves with you and provides good compression in those areas that need it most.  i will order another pair in nude
133627	and just on the picture basically. i mean i didn't even need to trial walk in it... i can't even stand in it! first of all the sparkling things come off a lot...i don't like that...but the most annoying thing is that front is so curled up that it's sooooooo uncomfortable!!!!!! i do not recommend it... i expected so much...but i was so disappointed its not even average comfort level. oh and it's true to size...
133641	i have researched hundreds of gloves trying to find the right pair.  i walk my dog 3 times a day in all kinds of weather.  i wanted a pair that was waterproof, warm, flexible, and able to use smart phone.  the only thing these fit are flexible.  i cannot use with my smartphone at all, still have to take gloves off.  i printed the hand off and measured according to their size chart i needed a 9, they are too big.  returning for a refund.
133663	my boyfriend is extremely happy with these. he loves how cushy they are, how supportive the wide strap is, and how well they fit at a size 13. he says they give a satisfying thwack when he walks.
133668	this looks a bit big and rectangular in the photo. however, in reality it is more tapered at the top and looks like a messenger bag purse and not a bulky briefcase when seen in person so it is quite attractive. yet is also holds loads of stuff that's organized well with all of its pockets.when i travel, i always take my ipad but that has resulted in issues. i always pay to carry my dog on the flight yet they still count that as a carry-on. my purse is a second carry-on. even if i travel for work pet-free, carrying a briefcase and a purse everywhere is bulky and awkward yet i hardly wish to leave my computer in a motel room when i go out, even to dinner, either.flash forward to home life. i often take my ipad with me when i'm out and about as well.this is the beauty of this bag. while it takes travel into consideration via an enclosed optional strap to strap the bag to your luggage when hauling it about, it's attractive enough as a messenger bag that you can use it as a purse only--that just happens to also house your ipad.the case i use on my ipad is thick yet the protective pocket in this bag fits it perfectly. better yet, it has lightweight but heavy enough padding that you could tote your ipad without a case without fear of breakagebut it also has separate sections for all your purse essentials away from the ipad. and even an extra one on the outer pocket. great for quick grabs like storing your keys or airline tickets.the strap is adjustable so you can have it super long for the messenger bag diagonal carry which also keeps it safe from purse snatchers, but you can easily shorten it to any length if desired.i'm enjoying the bag and it appears to be well made.
133748	what i have learned about shape wear is that larger is better. i know - it's suppose to cinch everything in but at some point that extra whatever has to jut out somewhere.  i'd rather buy a larger size - be able to actually get it on - and be a bit more comfortable in the process.  i had forgotten this rule when i made this purchase.
133758	this product was exactly as advertised and the exact same product sold in stores, for half the price. good value!
133825	i think the quality on the disney bodysuits is unmatched.  the fit is good, the extra snaps are amazing, and they are super soft and durable.  i use them as clothing blanks for my business and they are getting harder to find, as i assume they have been discontinued.  bummer.
133901	this boots are exactly as described. i wear size 6 and that's what i ordered. they fit great. the other reviews said that the fur insides stay on the clothing but mine don't shed.
133957	wonderful expedient delivery. excellent clarity, shine and size. picture represented the pendant clearly and defined. the color of the stones was a beautiful light pink/purple. complements her other jewelry wonderful. you made a little lady very happy. received it in less than 48 hours. what a great surprise to have happened. a big thumbs up! my wife loved it for her birthday present today. two day service is consistantly on time. amazon prime rocks! thank you for the great service and product selection. we plan on continuing our loyalty and purchases through amazon. you've earned our business. thank you.
133968	"i have to wonder whether these are really lab created (the same composition as natural stone) or simulated.  yes the stones are big and bright but there is not much sparkle (which could be the cut) and the color looks a bit unnatural.  i have the ""ruby"".  the color is a bit too red, closer to natural garnet than ruby.  i would compare them to rhinestones, ""paste"" or a poor cut or quality cubic zirconia.  i am saying this as someone who has made jewelery for upwards of 30 years and who has attended dozens of gem shows, visited dealers and showrooms.  i know what a natural ruby should like like, and this is not it.i bought these because i lost one of a pair of nicer ones i had, and just wanted something for everyday use.  i am not sure if i want to keep them even though they cost like costume jewelry.  they look like it too.  created stones should be effectively identical to natural stones (without the flaws).  simulated could be anything.  i do not know which these are but they do not look like real rubies , not any i have seen."
134018	i bought these for my niece for christmas. very good quality and the stone is the perfect size for a pendant.
134054	i wore this with the mad hatter hat and a skirt to make my own costume and it was a hit!  it fit well too.
134082	its was aright i guess it didn't show as much of the blue and green colors that it shows in the picture it was mostly pink..
134122	i wear an 8.5m and that's what i purchased based on other reviews.  they fit well but the heel back is a little low and they are requiring some break in.  i have had a broken right foot, a broken right big toe and two sprained ankles so fit is always an issue.  these shoes fit with the inserts but feel better with a less bulky ones which i have.  when they are fully broken in and sufficiently stretched out  i'll use the inserts they came with.  support is decent.
134132	this is a nice watch, for an inexpensive fun piece.so far it keeps time well, and looks cute. it is a greatcasual little watch with a little bit of sparkle. the faceis easy to read, but i don't understand why they added thenon-working chronographs. i don't think it adds to the appearance,and it certainly does not add to the function, so i am not sure whatthe point was.the band is comfortable and fits well. there is plenty of band to fita larger wrist in comfort. one small note about the bad is that it has a rubber odorto it, which i assume will go away eventually.although i received mine from the vine program, the price is low enoughand the item nice enough to be a good gift for a casual friend or teenager.it also comes in white, and i think that i might add that one to the collectionas well, just because i like its looks
134134	i don't wear watches often, but when i do it's for fashion more than function. this watch definitely fits well into my wardrobe of cute skirts, sweaters, boots, heels, and jeans. i plan to buy the white one as well. although it's oversized, i didn't find it to be over-the-top big like some watches. it should fit well on any average or larger womans wrist. smaller women (size 4 & below) might want to skip this one unless they like slightly oversized watches. also, although i am over 40, i tend to dress like a 20-30 something, and most women my age would not wear this type of watch. for me, that is just one more reason to buy it!the rhinestones provide just the right amount of bling, and the silver color goes well with white gold & sterling silver. the watch band does not irritate my skin at all, and requires no adjustment during the day. i've been  wearing this for several days and appreciate the comfort of the silicone band.the two things that really bother me though is that the chronograph sub dials do not work so i wish they were left off, or at least had a way to adjust them so they are not all in the same ridiculous position (pointing straight up). also, the two side buttons are non-functional, and although they look nice they do nothing.for the price, this is a great fashion accessory that will get compliments. it's a nice everyday fashionable watch that is affordable for every budget.**********************update:  this watch was exposed to a little bit of rain and got misty under the face. i would not recommend this watch because it is not even water resistant.
134168	"this toy is really cute.  it contains little egg shaped creatures that travel down a path and hop along, popping up steps - don't know how to describe it except as a bit of a ""mouse trap"" like action.  my toddler likes to play with this on occasion.  unfortunately, the toy doesn't hold her attention for long.  also the little creatures can easily get lost, as she is much more likely to walk off with them than use them with the equipment."
134223	had to return this sport coat, the quality and color were great, however the fit wasnt. im 6'1&#34; 180 lb and always am able to wear a 40reg off the shelf, but not with this. the shoulders and shoulder pads were so huge it looked like i had football shoulder pads on underneath. also not sure how i feel about the brass,gold colored buttons.
134252	"first i ordered one in my usual size medium and it was far to small, i exchanged for a large and it fit great and i liked it. i decided to order 2 more thinking that now i knew what size i needed. one color was delayed so one arrived on its own, it was the right size but had one arm that was defective about 2"" narrower there for uncomfortable and tight i got an exchange when it arrived it was suppose to be the same size yet far to big, it seemed a true large this time and the label was different. then the last one arrived and i was lucky it came as the other one that fit. i kept the large to ware for bed as i was fed up of the hassle. customer service was good and helpful and the return/exchange was good,if the sizes had been consistent i might have even got some more but could not be bothered to go through all that again. if you do get the right size they are nice, warm,look good and wash well at a good price."
134266	very comfortable and very fitting. i bought black. good for layering - as the bottom layer with t-shirt or whatever on top. not super thin, it's made of good material. not super warm either, but it can definitely be worn as a thermal type of underwear during winter. i would say it's comfortably warm but not overly so. i know i'd be wearing this a lot. good buy!
134275	this shirt is  almost identical to the bella irene thermal i just bought.  same soft, smooth knit that feels wonderful to wear.  the differences are: 1) the length at the hip and the sleeves is better on this shirt - the bella is unnecessarily a couple inches too long; 2) this shirt is a tad less clingy through the torso -still nicely fitting but not nipping as closely at my curves; and 3) this is a few dollars more, worth it for the more comfortable fit.  and i have to repeat that the soft knit is great - just what i wanted.
134298	quick pros and cons.1. it fit as expected.2. i ordered the dark gray one (heavy metal) and it's just a plain t-shirt (not the patterned long-johns style fabric). it's lightweight, comfortable, and works perfectly for the purposes i need it for.3. it's cheap.cons1. there's the occasional string hanging off here and there that i had to remove.2. it shrinks a little bit.it's hard to type a huge review because this is a shirt but i wanted something to wear under my more uncomfortable t-shirts. i've already ordered a black one and i plan on ordering at least 2-3 more of these (probably a white one, another black and either another white or another heavy metal colored). they're perfect for staying warm in the winter and work very well when worn under t-shirts. recommended.
134299	bought this for my son to match some pajama bottoms i bought him and am glad it isn't a shirt for his everyday use because it runs small.
134308	i'm quite small and the xs fits me like a regular t-shirt (most importantly, it doesn't gape around my hips or sag in the armpits and shoulders). it's great to find a shirt that is comfy and doesn't look like i'm wearing my big brother's hand-me-downs!this shirt might not be as comfy for someone with a larger bust, but the small-busted people need shirts too, and this is a great one.also, the indigo color is very pretty.
134353	i like it and the feeling i will be buying more when i get to it and stuff like that
134403	for less than $20 you can purchase an absolutely stunning looking watch.first you need to know that this watch isn't tacky, you're probably thinking that the crystals might over do it but the watch is perfect and doesn't look enormous on a woman's wrist.it's actually a really nice looking watch, so far it's had a couple of months of use, worn quite often, no crystals have fallen out, it is mechanically sound and does not scratch easily.i purchased this as a gift for my sister and she was thrilled, it came in a really neat box as well!perfect as a gift.for $20 i was not expecting much, i was pleasantly surprised!
134479	i have bought wide calf frye's that are too big, these are too small. i have 15.5 inch calves. i think if i walked around more they would have stretched out, but i didn't like how they looked anyway in the black. definitely order a half size down, like the other reviews say.
134480	"i have 17"" solid muscle dancer's calves, so finding boots that fit in the calf but don't bunch around the ankle is hard... and let's face it - this season is riding boot crazy town, with every manufacturer from here to the moon making their own version. frye, luckily, has had quite some time to perfect their riding boots, and are known to equestrians everywhere. the melissa button extended calf boot is more dainty than her counterpart, thefrye women's veronica slouch 77609 knee-high boot, and is very simple in lines and form. they are slightly taller than the veronica slouch, but do not go all the way up to the knee, and have a v-shape similar to a cowboy boot in the front top of the shaft detail, with two loops at the sides to help you pull them on. low heeled and built for comfort, these have a small amount of arch support in the foot bed, if that's something you need, but honestly, it feels more like a reinforcement support for the stirrups if you ride. they are slimmer than the veronica slouch, which is more bulky and a bit biker-casual. the extended calf is also slightly tight on me, right leg in particular, but this can be loosened up with a professional shoe-stretch at your local cobbler. they don't bother my bunions...yet. these are also leather-lined, which i prefer over the veronica slouch. make sure you purchase the ""extended"" selection with your color, or you will get the normal size shaft. if you are trying to decide (because it's not like we have many choices in the wide-calf or extended-calf boot market) between the melissa button boot and the veronica slouch, melissa is more sleek, more work appropriate, and also functions well as riding a boot. neither boot will go all the way up. don't buy melissa if you don't like the slight cowboy look to the shaft opening. make sure you order a half-size down. i'm a 9.5w-10b, generally--a 9.5b in fryes--and the size 9b fit best."
134509	this is a good deal for the price.  it was a good fit.  the cups could have been a bit firmer and the straps a bit shorter, but otherwise i found it a comfortable, well fitting bra for the price.
134596	bought for a teen girl, would buy for myself. it is very pretty and seems to be a good quality for price.
134604	the boots are really cute and keep my feet warm and dry.  i ordered 1/2 size larger than my standard size and that worked for me.  the tread keeps me from slipping on wet or frozen sidewalks.
134607	this is my second time purchasing a pair of bearpaws. i can say hands down these are some of the best boots (both my old pair of hiking boots and this new pair) that i have ever worn. they are comfortable, durable and stylish! the only word of caution about this particular pair... they are really warm, so if you aren't ordering them for cold weather conditions, i would look for a different pair of bearpaws. excellent quality at a great price!!!
134715	i work at a restaurant that requires knee socks with shorts as part of our dress code. these are perfect for the bar. they seem to be made of quality materials. they are soft and bright colored and i can't wait to see how they are received.
134830	after reading the other reviews i decided to buy a large instead of a medium because i'm a bit bigger up top than some.  i do normally wear a medium if it's loose enough at the top.  it fits great!  not too tight and not too loose!  it's a cotton stretchy material.  it'll be perfect for the summer.  i may even buy it in a few more colors!  it did kind of have a weird smell when i opened the package, but i washed it, hung it up to dry and it's fine.  it's definitely one of those outfits that'll work great for vacations.  it won't take up a lot of room and it doesn't wrinkle that easily.  so, if you decide to buy this, i hope you'll enjoy it too! :)
134904	the moc seems well made, but it is heavier and clunkier than i expected. it seems made to last, so if you don't mind the heavy feel, it should be good for you.
134917	these boots are so warm and lovely to wear. they slip on easy standing up and are perfect for a quick run to the corner store or around the house. get them if you love warm feet:) my shoe size is an 8 and these fit like a true 8. also once while out and about it started to rain. immediately i wondered if the rain would leave damage. nope! so cool. but i did dab them with a paper towel and let them air dry. happy shopping!
134943	my daughter got a similar pair two years ago at victoria's secret and they finally wore out.  she wanted new ones, and of course they no longer carry them!  i searched high and low before i found these and i think she likes them even more than her originals!
134993	i ordered 5 in purple, and 1 in pink for our bachelorette.  they accidentally sent 6 purple, but quickly corrected the problem.the gloves were a huge hit with the girls!!  they were comfy, stylish, and fit all of us very well, since the ribbons enabled us to adjust the fit.  the open fingers were very convenient, as we could hold our drinks and pull out our phones.  we received a lot of comments on them when we were out.couldn't be happier with the customer service, quality, and overall look/feel of the product.
135005	i like these, they're warm and durable. the stitching/seams make a very flattering design and really enhance curves(my ass looks great in these.) the reason for the four stars is that.. these are thicker than i was expecting, which could be what some people want, but wasn't really what i was looking for. these pants are very fitted at top and loose and flare at the bottom. i'm 5'3 and they weren't too long for me. they also did come up to just under my belly button like pictured. i prefer my pants a little lower on the waist, but these are comfortable so i don't mind too much.
135010	we originally ordered the florsheim but i got the wrong size. when we went back to get the right size there were none left. so we browsed and i believe he got a shoe that he likes even better. very classic styling and yet a bit adventurous due to the lizard skin.nice looking and very well made.
135028	they fit fine and i really have no problem with these. i still wear them as they work and are comfortable for running.i was surprised however, to find out that the material is not what i expected. the pants are shear/see through and are a little lighter than i thought they would be.in the end, i'm fine with them, just not exactly what i expected.
135060	these short are very comfortable, but only around the house! i would not wear these out in public, which is sad, because i bought them to jog :-/
135067	i purchased these to workout in because my other shorts were so big they would fall off when i did a lot of my workout routine. these are comfortable, stay up, great price, and good quality
135110	these don't even deserve a one. waste of time and money! these came broken and the setting was crushed. they don't look anything like the picture. super cheap setting!
135119	i love these little earring. they are super sparkly and perfect with a little summer dress.  i bought two pair.  one for me and one for my daughter.
135170	i was originally not happy with my product. guess what, they are refunding me, and i don't have to ship product back! also they stated that they will be sending me a necklace with pendant to show they care about there customers. wow, nice surprise! thanks!
135173	very nice pair, nice sparkle. they are a little small for my style but they are definitely cute. i usually like an earring size of 10mm, these are probably a 7mm. but i'm going to keep them because they are gorgeous, and the silver post agrees with my sensitive skin.
135199	think about 2.00 carat size before ordering  for cubic zirconia smaller looks more like real diamonds the larger size actual makes the fact they are zirconia shine out.
135213	great price, looks great, posts weren't exactly straight when i got them but didn't have any problems with wearing them.
135249	rate 3, sterling sliver earrings made may ears sore, i gave them away too a friend, i would tell a friend
135255	pretty well pleased overall. were nice this summer.barely cover feet, but okay. i would order theseagain if need be.
135270	i have never liked the look of uggs and other such boots, but needed a pair of warm boots to wear in dry, but cold, conditions.  i also wanted a pair of boots that would look okay over a pair of leggings or skinny jeans.  seeing the many photos online and thinking these might be the perfect boot for my needs, i ordered these boots.big mistake.i ordered these boots in a size 10 because i usually wear between a 9 and a 10 (but usually a 9.5 to 10).  the boots were very tight on my feet, even without socks on!  they also were very tight around my calves even without leggings or skinny jeans.  there was certainly no way i could wear these boots in the way i would want to wear them.these boots were also not what i was expecting, appearance-wise.  they looked nice on the toe box and lower shoe area, but the upper part was more quilted than i thought by looking at the pictures.  it also didn't precisely match the lower part of the boot, which made the boot look somewhat cheap.these boots got sent back and i will not be purchasing another pair.
135439	i just got one of these to see how good it was.  quality is okay, but boy, the pictures are misleading.  i got the bu, thinking it was turquoise, like the picture.  not.  it's a very dark teal, between 'peacock' and dark teal.  i happen to like that color, and have outfits to go with the scarf.  but it wasn't what i wanted.  dark teal and black, with camel interwoven in paisley.  nice enough pattern and quality for the price.so just know, that the actual shades are much darker than the picture shows.
135440	i got the be (sparkling color) the blue color is very similar as the picture.  its not very thick but, so pretty. i got this for a friend who has cancer and thought she could wear it now and through the winter months. you cant beat the price. it has a slight shimmer look to it. not over the top. still elegant. i would purchase more in the future,  as gifts.
135441	(br sparkling) one of the reviews says it's too ugly to give as a gift. i'll take it, if you don't mind. one reviewer's trash is another reviewer's treasure. and speaking of label. why would anyone want to take the label off? i don't even see the need to wash it, at least not so soon. my only negative observation is the static electricity, when it comes in contact with another scarf. overall, this is absolutely beautiful.
135447	this shawl is absolutely gorgeous. definitely a good deal for the price. i purchased the bf sparkling and the picture doesn't do it justice. the blue is a very rich color and the reverse is an equally beautiful beige/gold color and both sides shimmer nicely. it's also warm and very comfortable and soft. very pleased with this purchase.
135509	the shoes come just like i pictured them to be. plus, they send extra shoelaces--which you don't need because the elastic lid inside will keep the shoes to your feet. love the insoles as well, since they're comfortable. finally, i love it more because there's no visible label or logo outside (the way i like my sneakers or slip-ons).
135565	i change out my purses pretty much on a daily basis, so i have to have something like this or i would go crazy. i also love big purses, so this works great. when full, this organizer is pretty big, so i can imagine it would be difficult to use in a medium purse unless you don't plan on filling it up. it's nothing fancy, but it has plenty of pockets and it made of a sort of material that you can wipe off it you spill something on it. you can also reverse it if you want to.
135575	interesting piece of costume kit my kit arrived in the mail in the most excellent packaging!!!pros:nice pricelooks amazing with the right costumecons:yes the buttons are glued on (but most steampunkers remove these buttons and sew on there own design)yes the velcro doesn't do well at attaching to the costume the solution is amazingly simple.how to fix the velcro issue:get some sticky back velcro and some thread that matches the spats color black or brown really simple apply velcro to the top of the spats then apply the other side of the velcro to your steampunk pants once finished your spats will never fall and you never have to worry about them ever
135664	i received these pj's about two weeks ago.  i love them!  they are so comfortable for lounging and sleeping.  i have washed them twice in cold water with no problems at all.  no need to iron. these are cute in a teenage way and they look great no matter your age (i'm 67).  i am so tempted to go back and buy another set.  i ordered pink and it was exactly as photographed.  i love the way they fit, it is not too tight anywhere on my body. with many pj's the pants fit fine, but the tops are too small.  this is the first pair that gives me plenty of room in the top and bottom with out looking too large or saggy. i have never regretted buying these.
135671	i got these on clearance. i probably couldn't afford them at regular price. prana yoga clothing is really nice, well-made, stuff (and a lot of it is actually made in the usa). these are no exception. they fit very nicely and if i had a nice butt it would look great in them. however, i have a pretty mediocre butt so it just looks..well...mediocre in them. but probably less mediocre than it would look in a pair of baggy gym shorts. that's not saying that *your* butt wouldn't look great in them, though. i'm sure it would.i mainly bought them to do what they are designed for - yoga. they work very well for that because they have a good amount of stretch and they are form-fitting, so they don't get in the way or bind or anything annoying like that. the waistband is nice. it's kind of wide and doesn't get all twisty or anything. they are not so short that your butt crack shows when you bend over but they don't come up so high that you feel like you've been magically transported to the 1980s, either. they are, in my opinion, the perfect rise.the length of the legs would be great if i had those kind of legs that you don't mind showing in public. obviously, *i* won't be wearing these out of the house but that doesn't mean that *you* shouldn't. especially, if you have great legs. these would be a great way to show them off.so..uh...namaste and happy short shopping!
135694	when you are a big woman only that is very frustrating especially when you are shopping. is very difficult find something really amazing, you haven't expectative to get that you look very nice because your body doesn't help you, so finally you bought only that fit on. with this top you have all: you look great!... more thin, femeni, confortable, in... and you can wear it for a casual or an elegant look. it's a beautifull blouse. size and fit are correct. i recomend to you, my partner, this top. (sorry for my english)
135743	it is sure nice to own a watch that you know when you buy it that you are not going to have to open the watch and buy and replace an expendable battery. the problem with a mechanical movement watch, though, is that it just isn't as accurate as a quartz movement. my other invicta watch is a swiss quartz watch, 9312 and is within a second a week of wwv time. this watch with the nh35a movement gains 20 seconds a day. this may improve when the watch is used and the parts start to mate together. some sources on the internet says this is in error, that no break-in period is needed. we shall see. i am giving the watch 2 months of wearing before taking it to my watchmaker.i like the nh35a movement which includes hacking and stem winding with 24 jewels, the screw down stem, the white face with black outline hands which are easy to read, the stainless steel case and band that will never ever lose it's plating, positive closing clasp, close fitting links in the band and the size/heft of the assemble.the magnification lens is not perfectly centered over the date when you look at the date with the watch perpendicular to your eye. for a purist, this a mistake. for a user, i find that this is an advantage. the wrist moves naturally to an angle where the lens is in correct alignment with the date.i have no knowledge of the ability of seeing this watch in the dark. if i want to know the time in the dark, i use my smart phone. i find that after repairing my rolex submariner for five times the price of this watch, i enjoy this watch almost as much as my rolex.
135752	wonderfully soft and silky.  i bought three of these, as they are good used as layers of on their own.  the price is perfect.
135797	this shirt fit me like i expected based on the picture. it is comfortable, light and very pretty.if this is intended as a stand alone shirt, though, i highly recommend against white!i bought the white top in hopes of adding some lighter shades to my wardrobe, and found myself needing to wear a dark tank top underneath, just to maintain even the mildest sense of modesty. the white shirt is actually nearly completely transparent!!!it is a great, comfortable shirt, but i didn't expect a see-through top at all. i was looking for a new shirt i could wear and be comfortable, and instead, i just got something to wear over another shirt.
135806	i'm one of those people who loves a light, semi-sheer shirt, and this shirt is perfect! the fabric is soft and thin but not completely see-through--i would describe it as opaque. i am 5'4, about 150 pounds with larger hips and a small waist and bust...ordered a size large because i wasn't sure how the sizing ran and the fit was great. the bottom hem was almost long enough to cover my butt, which i was hoping for. the shirt was loose around my waist and arms, which makes it very roomy and flattering. one note--the neckline does not naturally look like the photo, to get that off the shoulder look you would have to consciously pull the neck of the shirt over the shoulders, so don't expect it to droop that way on it's own! i didn't really care about this, so it wasn't a big disappointment. the neckline is loose though, which makes the fit very easy and comfortable.all in all, i was extremely happy with this item, and am glad i ordered another one! :)
135817	i like the color and fabric of these shirts, the white is sheer like other people said,and the fit is nice except they are too short! i am 5'4&#34; 150 lbs, i wanted a shirt that would cover my bum, from collar to hem in the front the large is 18inches, if i raise my arms it shows my stomach.
135827	this shirt is a good piece of clothing to have but it isnt as shown in the picture. chick is probable 105 lbs and wearing a medium.i am 5'6 true medium and 150-155 and it doesn't fit like a medium.which is why i am not giving this full stars.the fabric is wonderful. its great for lounging around my house but i feel like a fatty mcfatfat wearing it out.also it doesn't sit off the shoulder.buy in a couple sizes larger and it will wear like the picture.-king
135882	the photo looked great!  i went by the size chart.  when i tried it on, it was too tight and there was a small elastic at the bottom.i returned it.  it was too light and too tight for my size.
135884	i love this shirt. it's very cute and comfy. not too thick but not too thin. simply perfect. i got it in a couple colors.
135906	this shirt was super cute and fit very well. it was more fitted but not tight thru the chest area and flared out a little more thru the hip area. love it and can't beat the the price!
135949	sized way too small, even after ordering two sizes larger than i normally buy.otherwise, it is a cute shirt, and the fabric and style are nice.
135951	it is a really cute top and i like it, though do not let your boyfriend wash it, because if it goes in the dryer, it is over.
135974	very very soft material. much more comfy than the other grey sweatshirt i purchased. the torso is plenty long enough and the wide-ish scoop neck looks great! i'm going to buy this in more colors!
135985	this is a cute top in a great, vibrant color.  the tighter strip on the bottom keeps it from riding up and makes it more flattering.  i do wish it was a bit longer, but i still like it.  considering the price, i worried about quality, but it's really nice.
135992	i wear a size 8 in tops, and i ordered an x-large. it is pretty snug around my hips and abdomen. i was hoping for a bit more 'blousy-ness' around the gut area. the fabric is thin, which is great for hot yoga or a workout. but i doubt i would wear this as everyday apparel. super soft and comfy as workout gear, though!
136054	love this shirt! got it for work and it also doubles as a workout shirt too. so comfy and wicked flowy. could be used for formal or informal wear.
136070	i order two of these and then went back to order a third.  i like the way they drape over your midsection, it's nice for working out without feeling like you're on display. i was slightly annoyed that one color (although all the same size) was cut a bit smaller.
136113	"i've been looking for a great tank top, and thankfully, i found it in this item. this top is so light that i can wear it under myjess & jane tops for women-3/4 sleeve poly/span ruffle sublimation tops""paloma""(style#74-281)and not feel a thing. this is a terrific tank top to have and highly recommend it if you are looking for a good tank top."
136165	the product is excellent, i arrive in time and quality. very good,the product is excellent, i arrive in time and quality. very good
136168	this bag was so cheap looking, i just threw it out! nothing left to say about this bag, but uurgh
136169	although its a cute bag i wish the material was just a bit better but overall i'm happy with it and it will be a nice casual bag. it has plenty of space inside and the price was very reasonable
136234	one issue! they shrink quite a bit on first wash. i bought a size up in length.other than that problem, i can't stop buying these pants in different colors.
136243	they are way to small in the waist, about six inches to get them closed, i wouldn't recommend them unless you go to a store an try them on.
136253	the 42 piece watch set with interchangeable bands has been fun and works well!  watch is still ticking and the variety of band colors makes it possible to match nearly every outfit!  you can even mix and match the bands and face of the watch.  good price.
136299	"i bought this bra looking for a racerback that might be similar to moving comfort's luna bra (which is the best thing since sliced bread!) unfortunately, this bra was very poorly designed, in my opinion. not only did it give me the dreaded ""uni-boob,"" but the straps were scratchy, the band was uncomfortable, the material does not wick away sweat, and there is no padding whatsoever to prevent embarrassing headlights. don't waste your money on this one, but do consider one of the other models that are better-made."
136383	unlike the argentium silver ring i bought from gemstone king these earrings are gorgeous. clear, bright and very colorful. i love these earrings, girls get them you won't be sorry.
136443	for the price, i definitely love this pair of boxer briefs. great value. cheaper than other brands. i use it for running and hiking. space down there is now more ventilated and dry compared to my cotton boxers when doing exercises. like others say, they should have made the waist band wider. can't comment on durability yet as i only have this less than a month. overall, a good buy.
136474	i normally dont buy sport/athletic clothing but i was going on a 9 day trip to italy and the county villa i was staying at didnt have a laundry facility, so as planned i washed my clothes in the sink and hung them out to dry.  these bad boys were dry in a matter of minutes on the clothes line due to the moisture wicking/quick dry aspect of them which was great!  i am very happy with the purchase and find them to be very comfortable, they look great and my girlfriend loves them! ;)i highly recommend them and i wear them frequently!  great product!!!
136482	these boxer briefs fits very good i love the support. i only washed  them once so i don't know if you're going to fall apart. i have a 36 inch waist and large works great for me after i washed and dried them.  yes i will buy more.
136499	they fit  great and feel great.really seem keep you cooler on hot days.will be ordering more . would recommment these to anyone
136518	as ridiculous as it sounds, i haven't been able to find underwear that fulfills a few basic requirements that i have: 1) completely comfortable 2) look good 3) nicely made 4) not $20.00 per pair and lastly 5) holds my junk and doesn't allow major shifts in position. it is amazing to me how many types of mens underwear do not accomplish all of these things -- at lest, not for me. i had found something that i really liked a lot (a particular style of jockey flexstretch, made exclusively for walmart), but they were discontinued. these are very similar, both in look and feel. the stretch material is very comfortable and seems like descent quality. i like a waistband so that the top doesn't roll over. i don't like a fly, and these don't have one. the front pouch is perfectly contoured for a man, and holds everything in place without restricting movement in any way. the look is nice -- athletic, form-fitting boxers. the material breathes very well and is great for all-day comfort, and everyday wear, not just sports. on top of all that, the price is very reasonable, compared with the competition. highly recommended.
136529	these are mesh which wasn't what i was expecting, but i do like them non the less, they work good for keeping cool!
136541	husband really liked these at first but after about 10 wearings they did not hold their shape as well anymore. by the end of a 12 hour shift they were starting to stretch out in the wrong places. he will wear them as a backup pair if i am slow doing laundry but not by choice.
136554	i purchased these shoes after hunting them down for a few days. i was worried after ordering them in terms of the size thinking that for some reason they will be either too small or too big-anyway with breath held i opened the box and was elated having tried them on that they were a perfect fit-i suggest that these little treasures are true to size, along with being very comfortable with a nice 3.5 inch heel-these shoes are adorable the colour is soft and muted with the bright yellow flash to remind one of long summer days in the sun-you will not be sorry if you are in two minds about these little treasures-they are fabulous!
136643	sturdy plastic frames and lenses. i like the style and fit very well. the only reason it didn't get all five stars is because of packaging. it was in a small box, wrapped in only a small plastic film.
136663	great fit! not cheap looking. people thinking i look better wearing these glasses lol. no complaints here. very happy with this purchase and seller
136763	i had searched high and low on here for the right black bustier set that would suit my needs. i finally came across this one and checked out some of the reviews. a lot of it was mixed, and decided to just see for myself. after browsing several lingerie sites, this bustier was cheaper on amazon compared to other prices it was being listed under ($30-40). can;t go wrong with a good deal.i chose a size small, since i am about 5'7&#34;, with 32/24/36 measurements. everything fit real nice, not too tight (which it is adjustable in the back and on the garter and shoulder straps).the cups were just a teeny tiny bit small, which was fine by me. i was looking for something to fit snug to the girls anyways.as for the thong/g-string it came with, i didn't have any problems with the size. i was afraid it wouldn't fit my butt (which is not huge, but it's there), and it actually turned out to be a nice fit. it's not really uncomfortable, so that was a big plus. i am not one to wear these types of panties, but it looks cute with the set.the garter straps were a nice little feature. you just have to slide the rubber piece down to &#34;unlock&#34; it, fit it to a pair of stockings, then lock it back in place. they held up pretty fine for me, but it's better to go easy on them. they're not the best kind of plastic and rubber. with a little bit of care, they will last a long time.overall, i really enjoy the crap out of this bustier (as well as my husband). seven til midnight has a lot of &#34;sexy&#34; lingerie for a pretty good price, so i can see myself buying another one of their sets since this one turned out so well.
136801	front & back are the same. nice stretchy fit. i ordered a size too large thinking it ran small. ended up returning it. considering reordering in a smaller size. attractive item for anyone not requiring a lot of bust support.
136826	to be fair we are sending this back but only for sizing issues, i ordered a small in navy ( looks black even right next to a black suit). my husband is 5'7'' 150lbs and it fit perfect, a little too perfect as there is no way a suit jacket would fit in there also. so if you are thinking layers order a bit larger, it is always hard to tell with sizing, the sleves were extra long as mentioned but for someone with longer than average arms it is great.
136827	es un muy buen producto, de gran calidad, por lo que luce muy elegante, y con la garant&iacute;a de una prestigiosa marca, a un buen precio.saludos,
136858	in the picture it looks like the material just has a nice texture and flows well, but in person it just looks like it's very wrinkly and of poor quality.the lavender color is a little flat/dull.  really not impressed, girlfriend didn't like it either.  might be worth it for sub $10, but for current price you can do better.if you're planning on some heeled sandals and really doing yourself up, this dress will look intentionally casual, however if you go out casual in this dress, the dress looks like you got it at a yard sale.
136907	no idea how this shoe passed the &#34;design&#34; process...gotta love the chinese crap they sell us these days for ridiculous amounts of money.  i returned them as soon as i pulled them out of the package because the heel strap is way way way too short.  i mean...your kid's foot would have to be a full size and a half smaller than the shoe bed itself to get into the shoe with the heel strap around the heel.  poor fit, poor design...especially the fact that there are big plastic connector things on the inside of the crocs--they'd have rubbed the skin off in one wear!  how do they sell us this crap?
136910	amazon has free return shipping on jewelry, which is why i was willing to try this.  unfortunately, although a larger chain would fit this, my chain was too large.it is, however a pretty piece and i was hoping i could wear it with both silver and gold figaro chains - but my silver figaro wouldn't fit.  if my chains had fit, i would be very happy with it.with amazon's policy of free return shipping on jewelry, it is not so scary to try something.
137014	i bought another set like this for me, some months ago.  those were turquoise.  these royal blue ones are very pretty
137024	i read all of the reviews and thought - these are the jeans for me!  and in a lot of ways they are...pros - comfy, long enough to wear with my shoes (slightly too long when bare foot) - did i mention extremely comfortable?  also, they do my make silhouette look longer and leaner - definite plus.  they allow my sweater to lay nicely, no seams, bulges or buttons ruining the lines.  as soon as i tried them on i looked in the mirror and rushed to the computer to review.... which leads me to...con - as soon as i sat in my desk chair the pants rolled down in the waist.  having read other reviews, possibly i need to go up a size, or maybe it's just the way i am carrying the extra weight i need to lose (i have a roll over rather than a muffin top - which may be the issue!i am keeping them, because they really are comfortable and i will just adjust as needed - or maybe i'll just start losing a bit of weight :)  i would say that if you have a slight muffin top you will love these, if you are carrying a lot of weight (rolls versus slight bulge) they may not be the perfect answer - however you will love how comfortable these are and they really make you look slimmer - i got the indigo rinse and they are very dark and a dressy looking jean.also, i found these to be true to size, i wear a 16 or misses xl and these fit perfectly - i don't know if you would need to size down unless you like your jeans very snug.
137028	great jeans that feel as comfortable as sweat pants but look stylish and slimming.  i was very hesitant to buy jeans without trying them on but these fit perfectly and are true to size.  i'm glad i didn't buy a smaller size.  i wear them to work on casual fridays but they are so comfortable that i forget to take them off when i get home after a long day.
137041	i love this got it for my mom for christmas. i was worried after reading people felt it was light but, real gold is light. so, i took a chance. very pleased light but, well made. perfect for the less is more gal.and, especially those whom prefer lighter jewelry. excellent quality. dainty!
137161	really like the boots and the fitflop sole - good support there. wish the upper was a bit firmer construction.
137171	i've never had a bad fit with fitflops and these are also extremely comfortable and cute. best shoes i've ever worn
137276	ordered these fruit of the loom low rise fashion briefs for my husband and was hoping for the color array shown in the item photograph.  i was a little taken aback when they arrived and some of the colors were a little shocking - grape purple, electric yellow, and a very bright aqua.  the other two in the set were a reddish burgundy and a navy which are much more subdued colors.  good thing my husband is easy to please and not that fussy but i was really surprised at the vivid electric colors used for men's underwear.  so, please do beware that the colors you see in the photograph may not be the colors you receive.
137284	the cotton that to do the brief is very rough and thin. i am very disappoint for my buy. i lose my money
137297	"to be honest i was looking for different, and to me more well known brands, but havingcome across thjis brand ""fruit of the loom"" and with my wifes opinion of her experience with this brand,i decided to make the purchase.i found them comfortable and convenient, after a wash they were fine.for me the fit was fine and the comfort was all that i could ever require.recommended."
137356	these slippers seem to stretch and i cant keep them on my feet and i bought my normal size! love the color but thats it
137362	bought these for the wife. she is usually a 7 so i started with the 7-8 size. they were so small her heels were handing off the back. i returned them to amazon to exchange for the 9-10 size. these were actually the correct length for a foot that always takes a 7. however, there is a band of material over the top that made them pull down very tightly on her instep making them very uncomfortable. so, the second pair goes back and this time the replacements will be a different brand. would not recommend....
137412	my opinion?bought one of these on a large auction site for a total of 30 bucks and i feel a bit taken, even though it still had the original plastic on it.as usual i took it apart and lubed the seals, changed the battery, and checked everything out. nothing special i.m.o.basic ronda movement, screw back, and a standard crown.the face is nice and the lume is decent.the big problem? i slapped it against my palm and the minute hand moved. wow. what a tough watch.my cheap casios and invictas hold up better than that.i just don't see anything about this watch that justifies the price.sorry if i offend, this is just my opinion.
137426	i bought these to go with a ring that i had hoped they would match  they are a little darker than the ring i got them both from amazon but  even tho they are darker than the ring i really like them they are pretty and comfortable , i will be buying more from them , they are very much like the photo and i think most folks would love to have them!
137444	i really like this shirt but the stupid itty-bitty triangular boobie &#34;bra&#34; pads show through the material! i bought this before christmas and have yet to wear it because i haven't had time to take them out and resew the what will be 2 holes where the pads are. the shirt straps are wide enough for a bra with a half-inch to 1 full inch straps. so it's almost ridiculous to put in those 3-inch &#34;bra&#34; pads... most plus sized ladies i know have much larger breasts than those little triangles could provide support for. you'd have to wear a bra with this.the color is great. the fabric is super comfy. it gives my boxy figure the illusion of curves (the good kind!). that's why i still give this product 4 stars.
137448	"this is my 2nd pair of merrell barefoot running shoes. the others i have are ""trailgloves"", the only difference being the canvas material on these is mesh on them. okay. these are great bare foot running shoes. they will definitely stand the test of time & miles. i ran a half-marathon october 2011 in these. it was a personal best for me, 1 hr 44 min. however, i had a painful knot in my right inner shin for sometime afterward. it was directly related to running in these. even though i trained for 3 months or so in these. it just goes to show that barefoot running requires alot of patience & persistence. i suggest a good compression sock to go with these (if you want to cover alot of mileage in them, like a marathon, or a half even)."
137462	i bought these in the tan color, and couldn't be more pleased - they are worth the price.i had a pair of plain haflinger slippers that lasted for over 10 years. they are simply the best. i have tried other brands and styles (including sheepskin) since then, but shouldn't have wasted my time and money. i love the cable-knit and flower details that make the charisma more feminine, with the same arch support as the classic haflingers.sizing: i wear a us women's size 7-7.5 shoe normally, and the size 38 fit perfectly.
137473	love this ..i organized all my jewelry and it super easy to hang all my earrings...rings..and bracelets....the necklaces you have to connect and disconnect but i don't mind...i use the top as a cute shelf and its very sturdy ...does not shake at all. plus it hangs on the wall ..takes up no counter space ...easy to see everything ...and looks cute.
137474	i had been looking for a jewelry organizer for a long time.  i ordered a different one and it was flimsy junk.  this one is really nice.  it is a great size, i love that the top can be used as a shelf for perfumes, etc...  it holds a ton and the items are really accessible.
137486	had to find a school bag for my daughter, the one she had fell apart just after school started. this is so great, might even last till next school year.
137511	this is very cute but runs very small.  i had to exchange it twice.  order a size or two larger than you think you need.
137514	i love this shawl so freaking much!  i get compliments on how pretty and flattering this is every time i wear it.
137557	this shirt is nice enough, like most thermal shirts (i won't call it a sweater... it's a long sleeved shirt)  it is of good quality and i think it will last... it is thicker than most thermal tees, but a little &#34;stiff&#34; and runs large...  the olive color is more brown than olive, but very nice!
137699	i am six feet tall, and it is difficult to find jeans that are long enough (and less than $250). these are great. they run very large though, so i highly recommend purchasing a size (or maybe even two) smaller.
137743	i purchased this for my son he was very happy with them he was looking for lightweight pants and they worked well for him
137763	i wanted to love this shirt.  the color is beautiful, but i am a bit on the larger size and the shirt is tight across the front and too long in the sleeves.  it is made totally to be tucked in with a button gathering it in the back which makes it fit like a gathered skirt in the larger size.  the shirt is also so long that it just looks sloppy on a larger person.  it would be good for the size 3 through 8 group.  i love the color but the fit is totally for very slim women.
137766	i tried it on when it arrived, it fit fine, but was a bit roomy. washing and drying it in the dryer, made it a perfect fit.  i am very satisfied with the quality.  it is warm and comfy, and sturdily made as well. i would recommend it to anyone.
137781	i haven't really worn this jacket out yet or washed it but i do like the look and style of it.  i'm 5'2&#34;, small-med. stature, 120 lbs. i ordered a small and it fits well in the arms and body.  it has a flattering cut.
137783	"i am not a jean jacket person, but i recently had the need for a lightweight, breathable jacket and thought, 'what the heck.. i'll try it.'  i have to say, i really like this jacket.  i'm 5'7"" and around 198, and the jacket fits great."
137793	i really hoped this would be a good jacket in time for the cold, wrong! it was 2 sizes to small, someone in packaging obviously read the slip wrong. i also thought it was thin, flimsy and poorly constructed (cheaply made for the $65 pricetag). i emailed the company immediately for a refund and they were courteous and said they would send me a return slip asap. it took over a week for the slip, i returned it the next day. this was weeks ago, still waiting for a refund so i can buy a proper coat! not happy.
137838	i am tall 5.10ft and it is hard to find long sleeved items that actually fit. i got these in the mail and was so happy to find them nice and long. one thing i am going to do is modify the pockets. if you sew down the one side, you can get two inside pockets. i love pockets in my things because i don't carry a purse. it would be great of the company would have just done it, but maybe they thought the extra two stichings would not be liked by customers. none the less, i am going to do it to mine.if you are tall...these are wonderful!!!
137904	bright color, warm and terrific... stay on heel, even with lower back heel part (which i really like). the embroidery is very attractive, too! i highly recommend for self or as gift.
137918	"these are very nice quality amethyst earrings.  they are a medium purple color, not light like some low cost amethysts.  they are a full 6 mm in diameter and the color is ""medium"" to deep"" purple.  it's amazing that such nice stones can be purchased for this price. comparable earrings with lighter colored cost twice as much at most department stores.  settings use a minimum amount of silver, but are well made and seem reasonably sturdy.  the stones are well matched and the polish is excellent so they sparkle as expected."
137923	these earrings are definitely petite, approximately 1/2 inch in length overall. that said, they pack a lot of sparkle into a small package and have beautiful colors in the stones. great everyday earrings at a reasonable price!
137973	i was very pleased to find this croc fit my narrow foot well.  the straps across the toe and instep were not too long, as is the case with many of their shoes.  it is a nice looking sandal and a bit more dressy with the shiny trim on the straps.  the color selection is small.  i am hoping they will come out in more colors that are classic, not flashy.
137975	i wear a size 9.5 shoe and ordered a 10, good thing because they just fit. very comfortable and great for the pool as they don't slip on the tile floors.
137988	i've always worn running shoes when traveling or taking a long walk, and this one didn't disappoint. they stay true to size (i'm size 7.5) and didn't really need breaking in. the ankle cushion was okay, but the back cushion might be higher than your socks (especially if you love short socks like i did). the color was also very similar to the picture. my only crit would be about the length of the laces, but you could always get a longer pair yourself. i'm gonna wear this pair of shoes for a light hiking in niagara next week, and i'll update this review afterward.edit:i've worn this pair when going on a light hike in niagara park and a non-stop two-week city-hopping. on average, i was on my feet for 6-8 hours a day, and these shoes were nothing but a wonder. i've had no complaints whatsoever, and my toes were perfectly fine (usually they got blisters but not this time!). perhaps the back ankle support would be too hard they scratched the skin for some people, but you could always avoid it by wearing thick socks.
137993	my 9 year old grandson loved this and it is a couple of months old and so far it is holding up fine.  i ordered his the cincinnati bengal colors as that is his favorite team and if he loses i don't mind replacing.  super fast shipping and great service.
138079	i bought the pink case for my eye glasses, because my bcbg case ended up breaking. i received this pink case in the mail and it was dirty on the outside and there were two stickers placed right on the case that were soaked and couldn't even read what it said... will never purchase these again. not to mention, the case is tiny!
138081	we chose this product for three reasons: 1)  we needed to receive it within 2 days prior to a flight.  2)  it had to be small enough to meet us air's policy to be considered as carry-on luggage.  3)  it had to be a competitive price versus comparable luggage.  this product met all our demands.  also, to my disbelief, my wife actually somehow squished everything she needed for one weekend business trip into this case (which is very small) in order to meet u.s. air's policy for carry-on luggage.  i believe the only worthy competitor in size to this bag was the e-bag; however, i do recall the e-bag was more expensive & the delivery was not quick enough to meet our desire that particular time.
138082	i got this for my mother and she absolutely loves it but, when i saw it in person, i was surprised at how small it is.
138103	"this is the kind of bag that you want to stash your laptop and a book in. no need to carry an extra purse, as this bag is big. i'm only 5'4"" and feel that any bag bigger than this would overpower me. it is a classy deep brown that looks good with everything. perfect for those of us who would rather not kill a crocodile (or pay for one to be killed). the bag is obviously not real, but manages to look high quality due to it's fine proportions and sturdy hardware. at this price, you need it! i just got this so not sure about durability, yet."
138179	it's a great vest, really. i am a small frame and was a bit hesitant that it would be too boxy. it tapers and lends some femininity, but a little more would be nice. it's bright, it fits nicely and will be very useful in my wardrobe - especially for the price. i'll keep shopping for one that's a little more fitted, tailored - but it's great in a pinch.
138187	i like these capris.  they came in the mail at a normal rate.  they were scratchy after the first washing.  but soft after the second.  but the reason i gave them a 4 star is because they are see through.  so if you dont want to give a embracing show wear boy shorts with them.  but other then that i like them.
138262	perfect, perfect, perfect!  this hat and scarf are beautiful and versatile.  packed easily into my suitcase and survived the trip from the midwest us to hawaii.  it also made my chubby frame look slimmer!!!  :)
138291	arrived before the delivered estimate. my mon like it a lot, it's something that she needed. tshe will recommended and has a great price too.
138334	decent tactical pants but they do not stretch, at all, its very simple. they are ok but they are advertised as having a stretch material. i am a strong guy and i pulled the material apart with my hands in various areas and there is not one bit of stretching going on, just seems like regular tactical pant material to me, which is fine of thats what you want but its advertised as being able to stretch and it just doesnt. i would upload a video to prove it but i dont have the time. im a very mobile guy so the first thing i do when i get pants is see if i can move in them, i try a few high kicks and knees and deep squats (its unlikely you would ever need to do that in these pants but the idea is to see if they restrict extreme movements at all) these pants restricted every one of those movements to some degree, thats why i wanted stretch tactical pants, which these were advertised as but in reality are not! i am going to try the 5.11 stryke pant and see if that actually stretches as they claim it does.
138347	these are authentic, light weight, brand new k-swiss shoes that fit true to size. the original shoe box was included when shipped- shipping was quick!
138355	"the invicta men's 1106 pro diver watch is both bright and classic looking at the same time, with a solid build.size wise this invicta is huge.  the face of the watch is almost 2"" in diameter and the case is almost 1/2"" tall.  it definitely stands out on my slightly narrow wrist, but even with its large size and substantial heft, it never felt burdensome to wear over the course of a day.  besides being large, the yellow version of this watch is very bright and bold.  i call it the bumblebee.  despite that, i got lots of compliments on it, and people really seemed to like it.build quality is very high.  the strap is made of a durable feeling, thick plastic.  the watch face is done is scratch resistant glass, and the stainless steel body feels substantial and well assembled.  the watch is rated to 100 meters water resistant, and while i haven't taken it swimming yet, i did use it in the shower and it survived just fine.  the only slight lapse is build quality is that the rotating outer bezel shifts laterally slight.the face of the watch has bold and easily visible markings, and the hands, hour markers, and numerals along the outer bezel all glow at night.  it lasts a few hours or more depending on how much light the glow in the dark paint was able to absorb during the day.  also, included on the watch face is a day of the month date window, an hour counter, minute counter, and seconds counter for the chronograph function.  using the chronograph involves a series of button presses, and after reading the manual, i was able to figure everything out, but i doubt i'll put that function to use in my day to day.  lastly, the bezel around the watch face rotates to serve as a diver's scale.so far the watch has kept perfect time for the week that i have been using it.all in all...big, bold, and substantial, the invicta is a quality timepiece.12/11/2011 update: i've noticed that the band of the watch collects dirt on the edges of the band and the wristband straps.  if you wash it, the dirt mostly comes off, but never quite completely, especially on the wristband straps.06/21/2012 update: a few weeks ago the watch developed a crack in the crystal.  i don't remember hitting it against anything, however.  it's still waterproof, though."
138360	"this brightly colored watch really gets noticed and receives lots of compliments. it is a high quality watch and is very stout and has a masculine weight and feel to it.this watch says it all, ""i'm loud, proud and confident enough to wear such a bold watch"".it is defintely a great conversation starter. although this is not my only everyday watch, it is a great accessory for those bold day.this watch is water resistant to 100 meters. so they say. although i will never be going that deep. i do plan on taking a family vacation next summer to the ocean, but will probably never get more than 100 feet from shore.i am impressed with the overall quality of this watch. no disappointments here.just remember... ""time is the enemy, we all run out of it!"""
138369	overall i really like this watch. i wasn't sure if i was going to when i opened the box and saw how big and red it was, but it kind of grew on my as soon as i put it on.it's big, that's for sure, and i'm not normally one to wear a larger watch, but it's not terribly obtrusive.i'm not a small guy, but i have to set this to the third smallest notch on the band before it's tight. so if you're a bigger guy, you might have no problems putting this one around your wrist. that was a positive.i thought for sure the red would be a little overwhelming, but it turns out to work quite well. not sure that it would be the most appropriate watch to wear with a tux, but it seems to go fine with a dark sport coat or a long sleeve shirt (again, mindful it's a big watch).the second hand is about the only one of the three small dials that i'll probably use on a regular basis. with an iphone and at least one other cell phone on me at all times, there doesn't seem to be much of a need for the stopwatch feature, but i'm sure it might come in handy at some point. i do find the bezel useful for measuring off short increments of time.another pleasant surprise is the number of compliments that i get on this thing. on the plane, at work, around the neighborhood, i get a surprisingly number of compliments. not being  a big jewelry guy i'm not used to that, so the added attention has been pleasant.one little gig on this watch. very shortly after i got it - there was a bit of a bubble that popped up underneath the bezel. not sure if this is a manufacturers defect or if i banged it hard against something, but since it happened withing a day or two of me putting it on the first time, i am a bit suspect of the way it will stand up. for that reason alone i took away a single star. even if it was the result of me banging it against something, it seems just a bit fragile if that happens right out the gate.as far as a time-keeper, i haven't been able to determine if this keeps razor-sharp time, but if i find that it's just awful, i'll be sure to follow-up. for the immediate time being - i like this - a lot. and i plan to get a lot more use out of it.
138389	it doesn't look like much from the front but backless makes this t stunning. it is shorter in the front than in the back yes, but that doesn't bother me. i am 5'11 and it sits just below my belly button so i don't think it would be incredibly short on someone of average height. if its a concern or you need to cover up, layering a lace cami under it still looks incredible maybe more so. the material is feather light enabling you to feel comfortable no matter what event you attend. i bedazzled mine with a studded pink skull and it came out really great (if you do this put something between the layers of the shirt because like i said the fabric is very thin so avoid ironing your shirt together with rhinestones cuz it's a bummer) i wish this shirt on everyone. :-)
138405	"i ordered these elsewhere (same stock photo & brand), but i felt it best to share my review of them. these are slightly smaller than a dime in overall circumference. the ""coffee"" color isn't as dynamic or striking; subtle. thus far, in regards to metal sensitivity, they've not caused any problems, but i'm tentative. if they do, i'll be sure to update. otherwise, they are simple, pretty little earrings. they're seemingly sturdy and will fit standard lobe ear piercings so long as you've not been wearing thinner posts long term. all the huggie earrings seem to have the issue of ""clasping"" or making a clasp ""sound."" every pair thus far i've had or read a review on seems to have one that doesn't want to click closed. regardless, these seem like they're gonna stay in place. they're light weight in the ear; i don't notice them a while after putting them in. i wouldn't recommend sleeping in them."
138411	these are more child sized than anything. other than that they are nice to look at. i am unhappy that i will be unable to wear them.
138440	bought them as a christmas stuffer for someone who really likes turquoise jewelry. she liked these, very rich looking at a very reasonable price.
138653	love it.  very lightweight.  it does have a lesser warranty due to less protection.  still a good buy to cut out the excess weight if one bag is free.
138671	have replaced or very worn luggage with a set of this samsonite luggage and love it!  very light and amazing amount of room to pack in it.  this is a very large suitcase wonderful for packing for long trips.
138693	will take some getting used to as they are made differently, when you get a cd with a pair of shoes you know your getting something that will be good for your foot!
138722	i work from home for an it company. about three or four times a year, i actually have to go to my office. it's three buildings packed full of computer geeks. i'm not particularly hot or anything like that, but as a geek girl, you tend to get more attention than you want. particularly when people know you by name only. i've taken to wearing faux wedding rings any time i go into the office or go to a conference or have customer face to face meetings. it takes the pressure off. everyone assumes you are married and leaves your personal life alone. most faux wedding rings look over the top to me. this ring is actually something i wear even when i'm not trying to deflect star wars fans...i just switch hands. there is a very faint green hue to the main stone that generally isn't noticeable upon first blush. it has some weight to it too...very nice quality piece given it's price. i've sent the link to a couple of my female it friends and they have reported the same change in response. also great for preempting the jerks on public transportation. it's more effective that trying to read a book or listening to an ipod.
138743	i've had these and the old coverts. these aren't made from the same material (i think this is thinner). you don't have the double pockets you had on the old ones. that said, these look nicer, are much less hot to wear (not so many layers of lining) and the side pockets are actually large enough to be useful. i stuck my passport in one of them when overseas, which i can't do with the old coverts. money fits nicely in the other pocket. the elastic waistband means my size 31 self can wear size 30s without any trouble. great pants, and perfectly acceptable for any office where khakis are permitted.
138790	i must say that i was skeptical about getting an alex and ani because they seemed slightly over priced for what they are, but i had a gift card and really liked this one so i splurged. now that i've been wearing it i must admit, i really like the extra jingle that it causes when i move my arm. the main reason that i like this though is that the charm is restricted and cannot freely rotate around the bangle, this gets rid of the obnoxious charm bracelet effect. the image is really clear also, as well as the smaller markings on the smaller charms. like i said, thought they were over rated before... not i'm trying hard not to buy more.
138815	this fleece hoodie is true to size and is so soft inside.  the sleeves are a bit too long, but i like them that way.  they hit me at the first joint of my thumbs.  the wrists on the jacket don't get stretched out when you pull the sleeves up a bit.  it feels quality and keeps me warm on a cool, windy day.  it's a little too thin to stand up to any serious cold but otherwise will do the trick.  i bought the black and have had no issues with color fading or shrinking.  i would definitely recommend this hoodie.
138850	"love this shirt, comfortable and it washes well.  the shirt makes a statement that, ""i'm a little unique.""  life is short enjoy.  fits according to the seller's specs.just a short addition...after 5 washes there is pretty significant fading."
138953	this costume looks just like the picture.  the top is a tad bit short on me....too short for work but perfect for parties.  its not itchy or anything.  shipped in less than a week too!  absolutely satisfied with my purchase!
139016	i love these boots!  they're super soft, really tall, easy to walk in and way more comfortable than they look to be.  the larger leg opening actually accentuates my legs and their long attributes.  fresh out of the box i wore these for 5 hours shopping and received many compliments on how lovely and stylish they were and my feet didn't feel like they were about to fall off. they rock for height and feel sexy on, without being hussy looking.i ordered the black ones and would highly recommend these boots and seller.
139043	after reading other reviews i ordered the 5x, though i would normally only wear a 2x or 3x.  the 5x fit perfect.. i love it but be careful the lace is very delicate and rips easily.
139066	this belt is of super quality and runs true to size. nothing chaep about it except the price. i bought it for a costume and use it for my regular wardrobe now.
139194	"big and beautiful is one way to describe this timepiece. invicta has released a very appealing skeleton watch that although doesn't have swiss movement still works like a charm.this piece, a skeleton watch with both back and front views, is aesthetically amazing. it does not need 24k gold, diamonds and a whole bunch of swarovski crystals embedded everywhere, it seems that the more ""blingy"" a watch looks the better it will sell in this current market. nothing could be further from the truth.in fact it's the simplicity of watching time tick away that leaves you feeling satisfied with the invicta 1091 russian diver skeleton.my reasoning for giving this watch a 4 star review is mainly due to it's striking pose, combine that with an affordable price which swayed me to change this to 5 stars. you get a great watch for an even better price - i paid $130 for mine, the msrp of $1395 is quite off but the msrp for nearly all of invicta's pieces are by no means a guide to the value of the watch.the watch does not scratch easily, it has had 3 months of wear, and i would wear it at least once a week, i would wear it more often than normal if it wasn't so big, if you have a small wrist or if you have not seen a invicta russian diver in person, you may want to reconsider as this watch truly is a beast, so much so that it took at least a month of wear until i felt comfortable having what felt like a couple of pounds on my wrist.also of note is this watch and it's huge crown, annoyingly if you do not put the watch on properly and it slips loosely on your wrist you will find that the crown and it's massive cap, connected by a chain, will hit your wrist and can be quite uncomfortable. this problem would also arise if your wrist was too small.fortunately i had a number of russian divers and know how big they are so this was not an issue.in conclusion invicta have laid down a solid foundation of skeleton watches that look the part, this model may not have the luxury of swiss movement but the manual wind is not so bad and it keeps time well.you would be hard pressed to find a large watch like this with skeleton features front and back for less than $150, if you can, good luck to you."
139197	this is a great watch. i collect watches and it is one of the very best looking of all of the skeleton watches that i have. if you have a large wrist this will look great with sports wear. you can't by a watch like this for the price advertised everyday. if you l;like it buy it because they won't last long. for you people that don't believe that this watch did and still does retail for $1400.00, wrong, it still does.
139204	this watch is heavey, but awesome at the same time, i have gotten a lot of compliments. well worth it
139222	this ring is beautiful and sparkles no matter what kind of light.  it's a great price and well worth it!
139248	came on time, looks nice, but i was a bit disappointed to find out it didn't come with stockings. i got it as a surprise and the tie behind the neck isn't what i was expecting but its easy enough to hide with my hair
139256	amazon did it right with this bracelet.  quality excellent, delivery and packaging wastop drawer.  wish i had ordererd more for this price.  hope they have offers like this in the future.
139267	this dress is great fits me perfect the length is great am using it for church its just elegant flows really well i really love it i recommend it highly thanks.
139268	it's so very sexy. i can't wait  until spring and summer to wear it! it's comfortable and flattering to any figure.
139284	they are comfortable. every also compliments on them. well made shoes. you wont be disappointed. shoe lover recomends these to happy feet for me
139449	seriously, i have never had better boot socks. after purchasing these, i purchased a bunch more.  they are amazing, i love them.  i wear these every time i get the chance.  cannot say enough good things about them, plus they are less expensive than many competitive products.
139534	these are also very comfy pants, they fit very nice, they donot sag, and the cotton is very soft.
139578	the watch arrived before the projected shipping date and i was pleasantly please with its appearance.  the watchband is a little stiff but it will soften over time.
139594	pros:1) inexpensive.  i also got a special deal this past saturday ($19.99) thru amazon.  it's -still- a great price even without the sale.2) very nice looking watch.  it works as both a dinner watch as well as one worn to the gym.  i chose the black strap to match the black face with white numbers/dials... i do think this color looks the best, but everyone is different.  nonetheless, it's a classy watch.3) indiglo green light is bright!  by the way, (unlike most other watches), this light only stays on for as long as you're holding the button (battery preservation).4) it's comfortable to wear.cons:1) ticking is loud, so i won't be able to wear it when sleeping.2) no date/day on this watch.  but, that's intentional because timex wanted to keep this watch simple in functions.not much more to add.  i'll post an update after i've owned this for a while.ask questions, and i'll reply fairly quickly.hope this helped!  happy thanksgiving everyone.  :)
139640	i liked the brushed metal look shown in the picture, but the actual watch has an even better looking polished metal face. the picture is a little blurry, but the &#34;font&#34; for the numbers is classic 1920's-40's industrial looking. kind of an art deco style font. it's very comfortable and the band seems sewn very well. there are about four inches of holes to adjust the watch to any size. i (120 lbs) wear it on one of the smaller settings and it still fit my husband (230 lbs) when adjusted out. the face is on the small size, so my husband wouldn't wear it, but it's still a &#34;unisex&#34; size in that i can see some men wearing it and it is on the larger size for a women's watch. the indiglo lit up face is triggered by gently pressing in on the dial on the side. it comes with a band around the dial, so that the button won't be pushed in and the clock start working and use up the battery. it has a pleasing soft &#34;tick&#34; sound. i haven't seen another watch with this nice of craftsmanship at this price. i would easily give this as a gift. it comes in a timex box on one of those clear acrylic watch stands. the box was a little bent from shipping, but i still wouldn't hesitate to give as a gift. amazon sells several other nylon watch bands to go with this. the face slides up and down (and off) the band easily, and once it's on your wrist, it doesn't slide around. this is a great combination of being inexpensive enough to wear around camping and gardening, and attractive enough to want to wear all the time! it had been on my wish list for a long time, wish i'd bought it sooner!
139649	great looking watch! i'm excited to gift it to my husband. but i think i'm going to have to order another one, perhaps in a different color, because i really want to keep it for myself!
139706	simple enough for everyday - nice looking, comfortable. definitely recommend this watch. only minor thing is that it does not have a date, but i can live with that!
139707	i love this watch.  i have not been able to find a braided band in the stores so was very excited to find it here.  large face, easy to read. love the night light. and the band itself is very generous in size.  this is important to me because i have a large wrist.
139709	i always get timex - they work the best for a low priced everyday watch.  the strap is somehwat scratchy but its wearable. you can always change the bands like i do
139723	i have small wrists (measures about 5 1/4 inches where i wear a watch) and it is hard to find watches that fit me.  the trendy large watch faces look pretty ridiculous on me.  :-)  the last hole on the strap fits, though it is a bit loose.  on me the strap end does wrap around and covers most of the woven detail on the top of the watch, but it is held in place by the loop and has not been an issue.  the color of the strap is a dark red that should coordinate well with a lot of different colors.  the watch face looks great, very easy to read and it is a nice clean style that should go with most casual looks.  overall this is a good value and timex watches have always lasted a long time for me.
139732	bought this watch in august 2012 for use on a trip. the black ion plating and general design of this watch is very attractive and feels very comfortable. i've had many compliments on this watch. the crystal in mineral glass, and is pretty scratch resistant. the back does not have a screw down case, it appears to be a press down type, and it's rated at 50m water resistance. i won't worry about scratches or the watch filling up with water though. since i had this watch i used it swimming in a pool about 3 times a week, went on 2 camping trips and a couple fishing trips, as well as 3 hikes (one of which was to a waterfall), and this watch shows no sign of wear or even a scratch. the numbers are silver, and is sometimes a bit difficult to see in direct sunlight, but adjusting the viewing angle usually sorts of the problem. the luminous hands glow really well on exposure to sunlight. to top it all off, this watch has the indiglo back light function, which is a great feature, it is very bright and in darkness you can get the time at a glance! overall this is a great watch and was an excellent purchase. highly recommended! see customer photos for the luminous hands and indiglo function!
139788	"love this shoe!  excellent arch support and padded heel cup.  i have plantar fascitis in one foot and just poor feet in general and so cannot wear anything but ""orthotic"" type shoes anymore. i wear klogs usa, orthaheel and danskos.  this sandal has been a very durable shoe, wore a lot this summer and still looks great. runs true to size and is roomy enough in the toe box area....can't stand toe ""hang-over"" in sandals. i have several pairs of klogs usa and find them very, very comparable to my danskos, but cheaper. :0)"
139818	this watch is awesome looks great on had a lot of people ask me where i got it.works great and the crystals haven't fallen out if you don't want to pay a lot for a good watch than i would recommend this one.
139827	for the price, the the watch looks great.  use for special ocassions, not everyday wear. the color will be retained.
140047	i originally ordered my husband a 9.5 (his normal size) and they were tight. returned them for a 10 and the fit is great. he is happy with the fit and says they are super comfortable. great quality shoe for the price!
140089	for walking on uneven bumpy surfaces, fantastic! i don't play tennis any more, but just use these for short (400 yard) walks on bumpy, tilted sidewalks, bumpy parks and paths. the extra width of the sole prevents any accidental roll-overs, imperative for me as i have an old broken 5th metatarsal. i'm sure this factor would be great for tennis too. i was worried about the toe box depth, never saw these in a store. i have a mild hammer-toe on my second toe, and there's plenty of room in these. i'd be tempted to say it's the flexible mesh, but my toe never even hits the mesh. speaking of the mesh, i can wear these all day with no hot feet. not good for rain, though, get leather.
140099	i have not been wearing the proper shoes for the cross-training workouts i've been doing; the ones i was wearing were horrible for lateral movement: my feet slipped around inside the shoes; my ankles felt unsupported. bad me. so i tried these on in a store and loved them: my feet feel very secure in these and there is a nice thick cushion cradling my heel. returned them to the store and rebought on amazon because the price difference was so huge--about $40 savings by buying on amazon. i'm able to move properly in my workouts now. it also doesn't hurt that they're very nice looking shoes.
140112	"these bodysuits are wonderful!!  they are very soft and stretchy for baby, and much thicker than most similar bodysuits.  they withstand repeated washing very well, and will grow with your baby to last much longer than normal.i loved these so much in fact, that i also boughtthe winnie the pooh ""follow me"" 3-packanddisney cuddly bodysuit 5-packand each set in multiple sizes.  these are by far my favorite onesies for my son!"
140151	i love it for casual wear with jeans or yoga pants.  love the color combination.  highly recommend for its light weight.  it almost feels as if you are wearing nothing on your feet except a little support on the bottom.
140153	these fit my foot pretty well as they are narrow in the mid section and widened in the toe box. i used to get new balance 442 but lately they seem very narrow everywhere as if your foot is a straight narrow line. these sneakers are a refreshing change and are fine for walking, running errands etc. i like the way they look.
140219	there must have been a management change at new balance, otherwise why would they abandon their best product, the original 608?  for some reason it was replaced with 608v2 which was a disaster.  then they tried 608v3 which would seem to be halfway between the disaster and the old 608.  why don't they just make the 608 again and pretend that's what they meant to do all along?also, perhaps another management change is in order.
140318	this bustier is very well made and looks great on my wife.  i am very happy with the purchase.  would purchase again.
140356	i have just started adding leggings to my wardrobe. i find they're a great way to make a short skirt seem not too short for work. however, that doesn't work when the leggings are just glorified pantyhose, like these. i was expecting form-fitting pants that i could wear with, say, a long tunic or short skirt. i can't wear these with anything but either tea-length stuff for the office, or evening skirts (if i want to wear it with something shorter). they're too sheer, and poorly finished. they're also way, way too small compared to other size 4x leggings i've bought from sites like modcloth.
140376	fabric is very lightweight and band around the bottom is very tight so doesn't stretch like the rest of the garment.
140388	they fit like tights/hose and are super sexy the 3x fits like a queen- a bit tight but still so cute!!
140393	these were a bit tight, i think the sizing might be off - i'm 5'3&#34; and 165 lbs, and it was a &#34;fight&#34; to get these past hips and stomach.  but i will deal as the price was decent.  probably wont  order again though, unless they come in bigger size.
140415	these look just as pictured, i had ordered for my mom but will be keeping for myself in that her wider feet will not fit. fit mine perfectly though.
140461	"just got these gold foldable flip flops today and i'm definitely satisfied.  ordered the xl and since it said xl fits 10-11 i thought they might be on the small side, but they fit my size 11 foot just fine.  they're very nice looking. i got the gold because they didn't have any other color in my size and i'm happy this decision was ""made"" for me. the gold is not gaudy like i thought it might be.  it's a very  nice shade.  the sole, being foldable, is not very thick.  i would not wear these flip-flops walking around the dirty streets of nyc because of the fairly thin sole, but i travel a lot and they're perfect for walking around hotel hallways and lobbies as well as airports, etc.  i'd also wear them to change into when getting a pedicure."
140515	i loved this costume, but i got an xl just to make sure (i'm usually a large). well, even the xl was very tight. not to mention the fact that the ribbon does not go through each hole - i had to purchase more ribbon so it would! all in all, it's a nicely made costume, and the fact that is was tight didn't stop me from wearing it, but they need to change the sizes or something. those of us with boobs do not fit well into this costume.
140543	"i brought the leopard and the blue.  i brought a pair for home and work.  when they are ""houseshoes"" i don't mind them fitting big.. i just want my feet to be warm and these will serve the purpose.  i mistakenly brought them a size too big, but as i said, i'm not trying to win a fashion show and for the price i'm happy..."
140547	"these were an impulse purchase during amazon's black friday sales. it is one of those impulses that my girlfriend and i have come to regret. she is usually positive and upbeat when asked to comment n anything. she refuses to talk at all about these. she also refuses to wear these slippers.i use the term ""wear"" advisedly, since the slippers we received can't be worn unless we use something like bicycle clips to hold the slipper onto the foot. the product photo suggests a half-boot design with sufficient stiffness and lining to help the slipper stay on the foot. the actual slipper has no lining or cushioning and essentially consists of a floppy swatch of thin material that can't keep any shape at all.the sole of the slipper is no more promising. it is a fairly thin piece of cheap foam rubber that is slightly better than cardboard but nowhere close to being something sturdy enough to survive even walking around indoors. there is no sole support. i doubt that the soles would last more than a month of steady use, but we can't keep the slippers on well enough to use them for more than very short periods of time.i'm sorry i can't report out better news than this. when these were purchased, i knew that snuggie products did not have the best construction standards, but these slippers still surprised me with how poor they were."
140548	"i have pretty big bear feet for a lady. i wear a size 11/12. sometimes a 13. i just have really weird feet. i decided to give these a shot, thinking to myself ""okay, these aren't going to fit very well. i could be wasting my money just because i dig the print."" this was a dollar well spent. not only do these shoes fit perfectly, but they kept my ice cold bear feet nice and warm. they are so soft and quite durable. when i purchased them, i was smack dab in the middle of a bronchitis relapse. i felt so much better with these things on my feet as i shuffled through my illness and the cold chicago weather. these shoes are beyond awesome."
140569	if i wear &#34;reg&#34; not mid-rise jeans or sweats, then i do see a &#34;bulge&#34;. not a line technically. however, i do love these for the following.1. fit great2. buy the size you normally would buy, not the size you want to be. ;)  (i know others have stated otherwise.)3. i've tried other brands of undies and i have yet to like any of them. i just tolerated them because i needed to.4 i'm a bali woman for life!5. ordered 4 different brands and hated them all until....... balii purchased hipsters for my sweat pants and mid-rise jeans. i purchased briefs for dresses, skirts and my other weird fitting clothes. (? ...)i love the lace topped brief panties as well.the no lines slip took about a day to get use to as i constantly checked the mirror. they feel a bit different to me than &#34;normal&#34; panties. i'm over 50 so this is a big deal.i've posted this on each bali i've purchased.
140586	the lace rolls down. they are so slip and stick to your butt cheeks, but they are constantly rolling down from the top. i would rather have them slide up my butt crack than roll down.
140617	"i missed out on this bead deal and bought each of these beads singly at 7.99 to 11.99 each depending upon the time in year 2011 in which i bought them. they are still available singly at approximately $7.99 each.i have each bead and have used it on one of my bracelets with the blue and teal going on a ""blue"" bracelet, the green on a green one and the red on a red one. they are all lovely and well made. that is, they are the usual high quality pandora type beads that are available through amazon. their size is normal and the silver inserts are of good quality and do not tarnish easily.i would have bought this grouping had it been available in feb-may 2011 when i was intent on getting my bracelets together. however, it was not available, and i had to buy each bead individually.i think this is a wonderful deal and suggest that if anyone wants these beads with their swirly lines, then, by all means get them. should i find that i wanted swirls again, i would definitely take this route rater than buying them one by one.i suspect that heirloom is getting ready to add new beads to their line and are making the older ones available at a good price so as to clear their stock of high inventories. that is just a guess, but it is currently close to christmas and time for the new beads to rest in the limelight.the are great, high quality beads. i certainly recommend the foursome and wish it had been availble earlier in the year."
140669	good buy for the price. remember that these are undershirts & they fit tighter than regular t-shirts. they also shrink a bit. i bought a size up for my son & they are a good fit.
140696	when i purchased this wallet it looked expensive. when i received it, it looked cheap! this wallet is excellent for those that have a lot of cards, id's, and stuff! i would have really liked this wallet if it was leather.
140733	pashmina scarf is soft and feels nice. i bought it for my wife on christmas and she loved it very much. thanks amazon, you did it again.
140741	it's a pretty scarf. i ordered the coral one, it's true to the color in the picture. the fabric is good and soft.everyone was talking about it coming in a fancy little gift box, and i was going to give it for christmas anyways...but it just came in a little cellophane bag. i felt a bit wronged i'll admit, but that's my only problem with this product and the seller. aside from my silly rant though, this is a great scarf. beautiful colors and soft material that really does keep you warm!
140752	a nice rub down with this, and my shoes look almost bright new.  i like how they pack a lot of tools into this one tool.  if you have those types of leather shoes, do them and yourself a favor and pick this up and give 'em a good, vigorous rub every now and again.
140758	this product did not work on a mud stain i have on the suede bottom of a purse. maybe this kind of stain is very stubborn. don't know. i will give this brush a chance and try it on other kinds of stains.
140825	purchased as an engagement ring, since we were unable to get the set of diamonds i really wanted, however, after receiving this ring, it is beautiful, nice shine, stones do not look fake at all and ring has a great shine, i love the band, it's kinda thick and the ring is slightly weighty which makes it look all the more real. you won't be disappointed. shipping was fast and for the price.........wow!
140828	"how perfectly wonderful that i can get these lovely nylon panties that never shrink, they come all the way above my belly button to my true waist, they cover my behind, they are slightly big, they are perfect.  being nylon makes my slacks slide up and over them easily.  as a teenager, i remember that we (my mother and i) bought vanity fair in the ""finer"" department stores.i don't care that they're called granny panties, that's exactly what i want.  i can just as easily go without panties wearing knit slacks, which i have done rather than wear bikini panties, or support girdle panties or cotton which keep my slacks from sliding up easily.i'm very happy to have found these on amazon and ordered a 3-pack of black and a 3-pack of white.  i ordered on february 12th and received on february 15th, much faster than ordering directly from the company.  well done amazon."
140834	i was pretty confident ordering this shirt due to the champion name and 100% 5 star feedback - and i'll add 1 more. unless you're hooked on the ua brand name, i can't see spending the extra money for their logo. i also own ua compression shirts and they both do what they say, but champion is much nicer to my wallet.
140856	i was looking for a shirt with a similar fit to the ua compression shirts at a lower price and found it. good fit and has held up well to wear. good product and good price.
140878	"ok the price is high. many reviewers, as well i, have gotten this out of the way. so let's move on, because what you want to know is if the price is worth it.is it? no.when first looking at the bag on the outside (and in, albeit briefly)this bag is attractive with a black body contrasted with white speckles while the inside is a mix between gray and baby blue diagonal patterns. it looks like an atypical laptop backpack and looks more like hiking gear. + 1 for that at least. also this bag is made in sweden, and it looks foreign (hard to explain, but that's not a bad thing).examining further you will notice lots of space. there are many pockets, and in some places you would not expect. there are 2 full size compartments in the back followed by many little ones in the front. there is also a hardshell case where you can put things that you do not want crushed (says uncrushable compartment, but you could probably come up with many ways that items in that pocket could be smashed--like say, a car backing over it?). my 15"" pc laptop fits very nicely in its pouch and; the cushioning is pretty thick on the back where it sits.the last positive thing i will say about the thule is that the zippers and outside material are well made. as you can see in one of the videos this backpack is equipped with those very big zippers you would find in, for instance, a very well made snow jacket. the zipper track is also thick and wide. the outside covering of the backpack is sturdy, and threaded nicely, but would be prone to snags.how could i not recommend this when it is attractive, has lots of storage, and has, up till this point, been described as being well made? read on.i did say some of the thule was constructed very well, but that is where it ends. the material inside the compartments is a really thin nylon material that would be very prone to punctures or snags if you had anything pointy or rough. with frequent use (i have owned backpacks with this material) it degrades quickly.the shoulder straps are very stiff and uncomfortable. it is like slinging a block of wood around your shoulders. when you add your laptop and other things to carry, that strap digs and digs until it starts to hurt after a short while. honestly, the most important thing about a laptop backpack is number 1: how is the comfort? if we did not want it on our backs we would have bought a carrying case.when examining this as a potential purchase do not let the price distract you such that you think you are getting more than a comparable item half the price of the thule. as you can see, even a hundred dollar backpack brings with it its share of faults, and in this case; the major fault impedes its ability to function on even a basic level--a comfortable way to transport your laptop."
140927	what a nice feeling jacket both to the touch and on the body.  it is lightweight and warm at the same time.  what a bargain.
140928	this has to be the most flattering fleece i've ever owned, and it's very nice and warm as well. i would say it runs a bit larger, i ordered an xs and it fit me well, looks the same as in the picture but the sleeves are still quite roomy, and it's not snug at all even for an xs so i could probably fit another sweater underneath it once winter comes around. however it still feels just fitted enough to also be worn under a jacket.
140936	i love this fleece jacket. it keeps me perfectly comfortable- not too hot and not too cold. i have long arms as well and the sleeves are the perfect length. i ordered the light blue and the color was exactly as it was shown on the computer screen. love it!
140985	i was skeptical.  don't like stretch socks.  this is a mid-weight cotton sock that fits my 13 foot perfectly.  they have been through about 12 wash cycles now.  they hold their shape well and no signs of premature wear is evident.  i will be ordering more.  they are a great value.!
141011	perfect travel purse. has a compartment for every item you need on hand. long ajustable strap so you can use it cross body. this will not be my only baggallini purse!
141013	i love this bag! i had first ordered the baggallini criss cross bag, but it didn't have enough room inside for my makeup bag (or the multitude of items i am used to carrying in my purse). this bag is perfect. it is large enough to fit everything without being completely oversized or looking more like a tote or diaperbag, as i find most larger purses do. i adore all of the pockets and love the color and material.
141031	i am a cargo purse kind of girl. i like lots and lots of pockets because i'm sick of fishing through my purse for whatever went to the bottom. everything about this purse is beautiful, durable, and amazing! the only reason i give 4 out of 5 is because only a couple days after getting this purse, the right side zipper pocket seam holding it to the body of the purse started to come undone- but now days, i can't get anything with perfect stitching, and hey! i keep a sewing kit in my purse ;) it took less than a minute to fix and nothing else has ever gone wrong with it.
141044	neutral color, lays comfortably at the side or across the body.  i use this bag as diaper bag, purse, travel etc.  good strap length and compartment design.  bought several baggallini purses after this one for myself and as gifts for others.  it's so lightweight to begin with, once you start piling your items in, it doesn't feel like a million pounds.  washes well...air dry.
141049	a close relative of mine has the espresso colored hobo tote and can't say enough good things about it. during a recent visit i took the opportunity to grill her about it and handle it a bit. it seems exceptionally well made and sturdy, and is large enough to hold most things a woman might want to put in a purse and then some. the straps are strong, the stitching tight and the lining hardy. it comes with a good sized coin purse that you can secure in the tote, as well as handy outer pockets, one zippered. she likes the baggallini tote not only for its utility, but for its understated elegance. it is an attractive bag that doesn't call attention to itself unlike some gaudy designer bags. my wife said that if i ever decided to buy her a tote bag, then a baggallini hobo would be one that she'd like to have. so noted! :)~ kort
141073	i was out with some friends when not one but two buttons were noticed missing.  you would think they would be non esthetic button, but they were not even ones used.  now i will have to send it out to have the buttons matched, another additional cost.  as for sizing it is a perfect fit. i feel bad that it is made in the usa, and this is the only brand i reckognized that was. all i wanted was a nice reliable coat. damn. day two it was noticed
141076	this coat arrived today. i tried it on and the large fits me fine. i'm 6'0, 200 lbs, with a 43in chest. it isn't tailor fitted around the stomach area, but it actually lays quite well on your body. it leaves room for a thin sweater to fit, which is great if it gets really cold. the material feels quality, some of the other posters have complained about the buttons, but i haven't worn it enough to experience that. even if i need to get the buttons reinforced the coat is great!
141103	most of my wardrobe is function over form with a somewhat baggy fit on my slender frame. so awhile back i got to thinking i would try and add something that was a little more compatible with my slight build for casual wear around town, but that would also be able to pull its weight in keeping me warm and dry.  i originally ordered this model in medium, and although it fit my 6'1&#34;, 165 lb frame fairly well, it did not quite achieve the fitted look i was hoping for, so i anxiously returned it in exchange for a small (i was afraid that might over do it).  fortunately the small ended up being very close to what i wanted.it is a little tight in the shoulders, but with a t-shirt on it fits great and is surprisingly warm on its own for a spring or fall chill down into the 50s. in a pinch i could put a light fleece layer on underneath for added warmth but it would definitely be snug.  whats more is this sucker is water proof.  i held the sleeve under a moderately running faucet and the water just beaded off like a duck's back.  it by itself obviously wont keep my face or legs dry but im confident if im ever caught in anything less than a torrential rain it will at least keep my torso dry.
141119	these slippers are cute and warm.  but they have absolutely no support.  so your feet slop all over the place and they really aren't comfortable.  i really hate them.  i purchased them in two different sizes / colors.  smaller size is way tight, larger size is hugely loose.  instead of these slippers, i'd suggest the acorn chinchilla collar slippers, which fit true to size, have a ton of comfy support and are very warm.
141123	they were cute and an appropriate size for a child however i was disappointed to find that the backings are made of thin metal and do not stay on very well. removing a shirt over the head tends to make an earring pop off fairly easily. overall, still pleased with them--- as long as we don't lose one.....this is an update: the earrings only lasted one week before both were lost. a shame, they were really cute. kids' earrings should have more secure backs. out of 3 pairs of earrings purchased between the age of 1 and 2, none have survived. the only pair that remain are a set i got my 2nd holes pierced with and put in my daughter's ears so the holes wouldn't close. they seem to have a stronger back than the child-specific ones purchased.
141202	i love this top, i bought it to wear to a holiday party and it was just perfect for the occasion.
141254	although very nicely made, these laces were not at all rounded. the were the flat type. i need rounded and not the flat type. they did not at all look like the photo upon arrival. the photo also shows them being that nice corded round type of lace, but they are the for sure the flat with a smooth surface (not corded at all).
141304	i like it though. great for spring or if your just feeling femine. the pink pearl on the bottom half is a bit abnoxious though if you wear tighter shirts and sometimes when i'm sleeping the crystal covered groves around the pearl will sometimes dig in to your skin (guess this isn't a problem if you don't sleep on your stomach). a tad heavy, which i really only notice if i'm at the gym or uh, well yeah lets just stick with at the gym doing pushups, planks, trx training, etc.
141312	i have always purchased bras with a lining and would never consider an unlined bra with lace at that.  this bra fits nicely.  it is gives you a nice lifted appearance even under a tight tee shirt, which i didnt expect with a 34dd.  it is not itchy at all.  it does seem to stretch a bit after some wear but once washed it tightens back up and feels like new.
141316	i purchased this recently and just wore it for the first time today. overall, i like it very much! the lace is pretty, and because it is not lined, it breathes well. it was a little snug, but i would not change the size. once i wore it for a short time, i was quite comfortable! this will be a great addition to my collection.
141320	i am 40 years old. i love lace bras. i think wacoal brand is the best. i bough the same at dillards on sale. it fits you well, no irritation. please note that for wacoal regular brand i wear dd, for this brand i wear ddd. will buy the thirs bra in the future but different color. i can not stand padded bra. thank you amazon.
141323	i love this bra because its very femenine and the prive its fair.comfy and pretty bra.many thanksrecommended
141355	this is shoe is almost perfect with a couple minor flaws. first of all it is leather and looks great. the design does not stand out to someone that isn't going out of their way to look at it since it is all black... so go with a different color if that is an issue for you. the insoles it comes with are surprisingly comfortable, and have a slight arch to support the mid-foot area. the tread is also really good, and the shoe always has a great grip on the ground.the biggest negative for me is that while walking up stairs or heavy elevation, the back of the shoe does not raise with the heel. there is just a very loose grip on the heel area since the laces are nowhere near the ankle and the heel area is low as well. i get that they did this for looks, but it is incredibly annoying.the only other issues for me are that there is one loose part of the threading that wasn't pulled all the way through and is slightly lifted, and the holes the laces go through are not tight so i have to fully tighten them all the way from the bottom every time i put them on. the shoe is also really flexible and bends with my foot. maybe this is just a preference, but aside from being a bit annoying i can see this creating wear on the shoe after awhile.
141397	i would go to a store and try these on first to determine your correct size.  i got these for my daughter who always wears an 8, bu these were too tight.
141462	i've already purchased 4 and i'm planning on buying more :)they have the best fit great for casual or formal or the beach!i have a small waist and larger breasts and hips and have the hardest time finding dresses that fit my curves comfortabllyand this dress does it!i'am a size 9 and this is great i gave one to my friend and she is a 13 and it fits her great as well!!and its such a great price!thanks for making these dresses please make more designs and colors and i will buy them up!!ash-
141534	you will love this chain, great quality and would buy again and again, perfect length and seems very strong not breaking easily..
141602	i'm 115 lbs and had to punch a few new holes in this belt to make it fit but other than that it's so cute!!! i'm a little worried that the paint on the gold ring and buckle might chip but we'll see....
141636	i liked the denim color. but they were really long and bagged out a bit shortly after i put them on. and a far cry from boot cut. they looked more like a flare. which may be fine for some people. but i wear sneaker to work. and that's a bad combo. they just looked hideous. i can't say these jeans are a bad thing because  that's just my personal preference while being short and all. different strokes for different folks. i would say how ever, you could probably get away with buying a size down. they may be snug at first, but will stretch and fit the way they should.
141660	some people have complained about the extra padding making them less effective, but my carpets and i thank you carter's!  first off, they are adorable!  my daughter just loves the prints and i think they are pretty cute too.  she prefers these prints to the gerber ones and they fit her better.  she started wearing the 18 month version at 17 months (she was 22 lbs) and then i recently ordered 2 more sets and they still fit her perfectly, a little better now than at 17 months (she is 21 months, 23.5 lbs).  i have been attempting to potty train her since 16 months and had started to see success at 17 months, but then she went back to daycare and couldn't run around bare bottomed and have accidents anymore.  since we only had two pairs of these at home, when she was in the other brand (gerber), she would end up with pee everywhere and we put it all on the back burner until 2 weeks ago.  i ordered more of these and now she is pretty much trained!!!!  she doesn't like it when she runs out of these due to accidents.  i don't think that was the secret to her success, but the fact they appeal to her, fit well, and she wants to keep them dry have helped considerably!  and her father and i appreciated that we can have our area rug out for the winter and don't have to constantly scrub pee out of it!  these are expensive, but i think well worth the price (and a lot cheaper than some of the fancier ones).  my only complaint is that they don't have more patterns.  these are adorable, but i would like to see some more variety too.
141686	i loved these so much i bought two, and might buy more, they are comfy, soft and warm. i also got a pair for a gift
141790	very pretty! but beware, you cannot remove any links!! i have very small wrists and its huge. i had to give it to my mom :( but it looks good on her.
141810	so cheaply made!! the &#34;rose gold&#34; finish rubs off and you are left with a spotty metal band. ugh!! i hate that i bought this.
141878	these are the coolest pants i have ever owned! i am in love love love. so comfortable. so cute. i attend music festivals and many concerts and can't wait to rock these at summer camp! these pants are amazing.
141926	its good but not perfect.. rolls by sides on hips and hurted a little bit and doesnt look good. but its my size. i like it because of color (bordo). and of course that ot invisible (untill roll :))
141929	the color and material are great, they are very stretchy but in the nature of the fabric the tighter you stretch them the more see-through the fabric becomes so i suggest getting a size up. i love them, they are super comfy!
141942	gave as a gift. have not seen, but have not had complaints. i hope they work well with her strand of pearls.
141945	i bought these earrings for a christmas present for my 20-something daughter, because she has fallen in love with pearls. i thought these were different--classic but modern, and they met my expectations. they are a champagne color, which looks warm and rich.
142021	i do not mind this flip flop, it is comfortable enough to wear all day every day if the weather permits.  however since i have wide feet my feet don't seem to stay completely on the sandal.
142024	this is the second pair of dream thong sandals that i have bought.  i buy a new pair of reef sandals every summer and this is my favorite for comfort, support, and look out of all the sandals that i have purchased.  i live in sandals when not in work shoes.  i have worn these to disneyland and the rose bowl swap meet and left with happy feet.  they are great quality and comfort.  the tread is nice and gives traction in the rain (i wear them year-round).
142061	the watch is so nice to look at and feels good on the hand but i was expecting more from the inside. what i mean by that is the back light is horrible. the first night i wore it i was in the car while on my way from work so i hit the light button to see the time and i had to press it three times to read the time. it's not back lit. there is just a tiny light thrown in there somewhere.overall, i love the watch but feel disappointed because the cheaper watches have a back light. i think this is an oversight. a watch at this price should at least have a proper back light.
142062	my brother has a penchant for watches and all his watches are g-shocks.  i don't own one but these watches are true to the claims of the manufacturers.my only advice is when the seal on the watch needs replacing be sure to go to someone who knows about gshock and get the original seal to replace.these watches are truly value for money.  oh and i checked a number of other sites and the stores as well ... amazon is the least expensive.
142073	i wanted a basic, go-with-everything closed-toe wedge for work.  i do a lot of standing and walking, so comfort is critical.  these.  are.  perfect.  so comfortable, they basically feel like flats.  i got them in the plain black leather, and the material is high-quality, plus the designer just nailed it in terms of details like toe shape.  i think pointy-toed shoes are ugly in general, but if they're too round they look cheap/childish.  these are just right.  they complement so many outfits without stealing the show--a really great basic to have on hand.  i like these with dresses, but somehow they're just extra cute with leggings or skinny jeans.  i wish they were less expensive so i could buy them in more colors.on sizing: i'm usually between a 10 and an 11.  based on other reviews, i went with the 11.  they were a little bit long on me (which suggests they're true to size since i'm between sizes), and at first i thought i'd have to send them back.  but actually, they don't rub at the heels even with the extra length, and i'm loving the extra room in the toe box, so i decided to keep them.  i'll probably add some padded insoles just because i have room to.i highly recommend these overall--you really can't go wrong with this shoe.
142074	"my latest watch review is for the invicta men's 1103  pro diver chronograph black dial watch.although i don't own as many invicta watches like a few associates on the wotd, so far i have only three and all three are working to this day.  in fact, one of my favorites continues to be a pro diver 8926c but what caught my attention with this watch is that it's a chronograph with a sporty look with orange and and orange band.  personally, i have never worn a band with an orange rubber strap before, so i wanted to see how it would look on me (i own g-shocks of different colors but not orange).i. what is invicta? what is a chronograph?invicta was founded back in 1837 by raphael picard in la chaux-de-fonds, switzerland. the picard family (no relation to lucien piccard watches) owned invicta until it was purchased in 1991 and is now america-based (florida) and owned by a u.s. investment company.a chronograph is a watch that does timekeeping and functions as a stopwatch.  the original chronographs were produced back in the 18th century.ii. packagelike other invicta watches, you get the yellow vinyl watch case with instructions via ronda startech (i'm guessing they make the chronograph?) and warranty.iii. the reviewupon look at the watch, i was quite thrilled with how the watched looked.  49 mm case, flame-fusion black dial window and stainless steel bezel.  date is on the 4:00 position, clock hands are in orange and chronograph is in black.  nice orange are featured near the minute marks.  three buttons on the side, the chronograph start, the crown in the middle to adjust the time and date and the chronograph reset button.  the rubber bracelet is thick orange, clasp uses a buckle.a.  chronographsimilar to chronograph watches that i own, the button on the 2:00 position begins the stop watch.  click it again to stop it and the button on the 4:00 section swings the chronograph (which is the long thinner hand also known as the ""center stop-second"") back to the starting position at 12:00.  the long thin hand is for chronograph timing (not to be confused as a second hand).for those who have never used a chronograph, there are three dials on the screen.  on the left hand side (near the 9:00 position), this is the minute counter, so for every minute the long thin hand goes around, it is indicated on that left dial.the second dial on the right hand side (near the 3:00 position) is known as the second hand.  if you have a regular watch, the long thin hand is typically seconds but since this is a chronograph, the seconds are kept on this dial.the third dial on the 6:00 position is the hour counter.  so, if you are timing something that is going on for hours, the dial will show how many hours have passed by.note:  some chronographs do not have an hour counter.  some primarily have the usual seconds, the minute counter and a 1/20 second counter.  this one utilizes an hour counter instead of the 1/20 second counter.there are instructions for the chronograph in english, german, spanish, french and italian.b.  the watchkeypoints:- this is a beautiful looking watch.  love the dial, the black and orange looks great.- orange rubber - it actually worked for me.  i wear a lot of black and the orange and black does look good.  but anyone who doesn't care for it can easily switch it for a black nato or other company's color strap if needed.- this is a quartz watch, not an automatic, so it does require batteries if it dies.- bezel rotates counter-clockwise.- love the arms, orange looks great on the black dial.  smaller orange arms are featured in the chronograph.- watches uses invicta's tritnite night glow technology.  the rotating bezel numerics glow in the dark but because the arms do not have lume, those who want to tell the time in the dark, will not be able to tell the time unless their is a little lighting to see the orange arms.- this is not a screwdown crown, so i would not wear this underwater even though it says its safe for 100m.  my wife had an watch with no screwdown crown, that was supposed to be water-proof and condensation built-up in it.  i wouldn't wear this in the shower or have it anywhere near water.- caseback is stainless steel with the invicta logo and tritnite info.c.  chronograph testok, it's time to check the chronograph and compare to my seiko and orient chronograph watches.  and the invicta 1103 kept up with my other two watches perfectly.judgment call:i actually love the look of this invicta 1103 pro diver watch and it's so different from my other chronographs which are more elegant than sporty.  this is one is more sporty and the black display with the white numerics and orange highlights, really make the appearance of this watch pretty cool.while the orange rubber strap may be of concern to some, at first i didn't think i would be into it but similar to how my other colorful g-shocks were, this one turned out to be cool! granted, i can see myself experimenting by swapping it with a black nato strap or even a stainless steel strap.  but it's definitely a cool watchif there were any negatives, for some, it would be the hands not having any lume.  you can't tell the time in dark areas.  i love the fact that it uses orange arms but for those who want white luminated arms, this one is not for you.  obviously it's a watch for timekeeping but it's also a watch created for style and this is one watch, you do not want to depend on if you work in very dark areas.  the bezel numerics are luminated but the bezel does not give you the time.and of course, the crow is not a screw down crown.  i was pressing like my other screw down watches and i realized this is not a screw down crown which surprises me because this is a pro diver watch.  so, do not keep on trying to push and turn it, otherwise you can damage your watch.  i wouldn't wear this during a scuba dive or even the shower.for the most part, this is a watch that is stylish and definitely for those who wear a lot of black clothing, because the black/orange really compliments each other.but overall, i knock one star down for my score because it's advertised as a pro diver watch without a screw down crown. i would not feel confident with this watch under water or any water without the screwdown crown.  but for looks and for a chronograph, the invicta 1103 is definitely worth considering!"
142078	there is absolutely no way to sneak a peek at the time when you are wearing this watch.  every time your wrist moves, everyone's eyes will dart to the bright orange strap and see that you're checking the time.  on the positive side, it's like wearing safety markings for when - swimming in the open ocean, hiking the wilderness, or justing crossing busy streets at night.i have a few invicta watches.  they all keep excellent time and remain attractive under rather difficult use - scuba dive with them, wear them in home repair projects, and wear them to work.this one ... i just can't bring myself to wear it. the orange is soooooo bright.  brighter than it appears on the website.  i called invicta to inquire about buying a replaced band.  black one would cost about $45.00 and take up to 90 days to arrive.  seems like an exceptionally high price for a little rubber.other than the band, the watch face is nice.
142080	i own too many watches, and there are some i never wear because 1) they look outdated, 2) they look good, but aren't comfortable to wear, 3) they look good, but they're badly designed and hard to use, or 4) i forget where i put them. the gorgeous new invicta men's 1103 pro diver chronograph is worn a lot. it's my go-to watch for everything but suit-and-tie work. i'm not much on rubber-banded watches--many just look cheap--but invicta seems to have a knack for making their look sexy, even in orange. plus a rubber band makes wearing a heavy watch like this quite comfortable over the course of a long day of hiking, or working in the yard.the chronograph functions here are largely a formality--just a three dial timer. but it does add to the overall look, and gives this watch a much dressier appearance than you might guess if you just look at the product photos.if you want pure class, this isn't your watch. but if you want striking good looks, comfort, a simple design, and an extremely affordable price, the invicta men's 1103 pro diver chronograph just might be the perfect fit--assuming you like orange, of course. :-)
142098	this was pagage poorly when i got it the stud was poking out of the package thank goodnes it wasnt bent to bad i fixed it and gave it to my frind i think ear rings sould be package better so this dont happen
142223	my wife loves bling. large stones are her favorite. this is a large stone to most women, but for her it is medium sized. i really like the stone accents on the band, and when the sunlight hits it, don't look directly at it or you will go blind :d
142344	unless you like to spend (or waste) extra time just putting on socks, these socks are a poor choice.  i thought i would never get thru forcing each individual toe into too tight home.  before i was able to get each toe encased, i just gave up and sent them on back.
142403	this was very nice, i am 5 ft 5 inches, and a size 14-16, and the xl fit really nice. the material is soft and silky and falls comfortably on your body. i would recommend this to others.
142425	i love these watches!  i got this watch in a different colour a couple years ago and i finally got a new one because the band had discoloured... so prepare for that to happen every couple years.  worth it for how cute it is, though.
142510	feel great, really nice shoes. the back ankle area might bother those who like a split ankle area.well done! !!
142549	shipping was very good, the bracelet looks very nice it is a bit stiff but i am sure it will soften with continuous wear.  very well made and i expect it will last a good long time.  very pleased with this purchase.
142628	this is the sexiest nursing bra i have seen.  it fits great, and i wear it every day! it has great support, and does the job right!
142638	i remember being scarred as a child by walking in on an older relative while getting dressed.  if she were still alive and doing cardio, she would no doubt be wearing this bra.oh, sure, in the pictures, it looks decently sporty.  it's the inside where its true 1950's playtex/maidenform/old jane russell self is revealed, with some evil cross-your-heart construction that's supposed (i suppose) to &#34;lift and separate,&#34; but actually doesn't.  like most sports bras, welcome to uniboob central.the basic idea of the two layers -- the outside layer of which clamps to the front and is adjustable -- is an essentially good one, but even at level 4 (the highest and most constrictive of the levels), the ladies still bounced around, and that might be understandable if i had boobs as big as a baby's head, but i don't.what finally made me return it is that thirty seconds into wearing it, i wanted to tear it from my screaming flesh.  for one, it runs rather small around the band -- which (in true old skool playtex fashion) is fastened in back with three hooks and eyes and is a pain in the butt to put on and take off.  second, it's scratchy.  don't know where your nipples are, folks, and i assume everyone's are a little different, but mine apparently are placed perfectly to be scratched by the seam of this bra.  by the way -- why is it necessary *at all* to have a seam that runs through the middle of a bra cup?  really?  like, that would pose absolutely no problem?the dealbreaker, for me, was the shoulder straps.  one of them (the left, in case you're interested) decided it would gouge through the muscle of my shoulder with the force of a garrote -- a scratchy garrote, too -- and what's worse, the straps didn't feel as if they were really secure on my shoulders. mind you, i have shoulders that apparently slope at 45-degree angles, and when i become a fabulously wealthy multimillionaire, i will have plastic epaulets implanted into my shoulders so that my purse will always stay where it is supposed to be.  that's why i generally love sports bras: the straps do not freakin' move.  these ones felt as if they were going to, perhaps explaining the death channel the left strap was trying to carve for itself in my trapezius.in short, i am returning this item.
142734	my daughter is five years old and hard to buy clothes for since she is growing. i bought a pair of these jeans for her for santa to put under the tree. she wore them the same day and they fit perfectly and where very comfortable on her. she ran and played and had no problems with them. the best part is she really likes them. i will buy some others for her also.
142774	this was a purchase for my granddaughter for her hairdressing accessories, after we alter the inside so her things don't go all over.
142781	for the price of this 2-piece set you really can't go wrong. the luggage itself is on the cheap side, but i won't be using this set very often. hoping it holds up for a few years. also comes with 2 keys for locking your suitcases. nice, simple style. my purchase also arrived dirty-fingers are crossed the dirt comes out with some soap and water.
142868	i love my other lucky jeans and was hoping for the same with these but they are a brighter blue and much baggier than the picture led on and what i expected for a relaxed straight leg jean.  they have not become more snug after several washes.
142896	i happen to like my tees oversized, longer in length, with slightly longer sleeves. these fit the bill! the women's tee's these days have cap sleeves, and don't cover your tush! the price is right on these, but i would suggest to avoid shrinkage, don't put them in the dryer. i usually just lay them on top of the dryer, and the air dry wrinkle free. would like to see more colors available in this 4 pack offer.
142944	what makes these so great? well some days a man's gotta compromise between his junk hanging and swinging in the air in boxers, or wearing tighty whitey briefs that make you look like homer simpson passed out drunk on a couch, while they crunch your jewels. so if you are active, these give more space to move than briefs, and more support than a boxer.this is probably the best compromise of the two. sorry ladies, don't read this part: it allows for more space for your manhood to hang along your leg to one side or the other when compared to regular briefs, while still offering support for the package.they're fairly durable. not plush soft. be careful with sizing, they run a little big.
142992	i really love the look of this shoe.  and i think the only thing wrong with it is my personal preference. i am very accustomed to wearing less heel, and these shoes seem to pinch across the toe.  i get so many compliments when i wear them.  if i had to order again, i might try a half-size larger if available.
143029	first, i am a dude.  i have big legs.  these socks still somehow fit me, and they're comfortable!  they breath reasonably well.  but!  most importantly, i now look like a superbeast when playing backyard football.  for me, that's as good as it gets.  these pirate stripes can take a beating, and they look good doing it.  i highly recommend these to anybody--guy or girl--looking to superbeast.
143051	"although the seller's customer service was excellent, the product is not ""boutique quality"".my problems with the bows:1.  clip is just clipped to bow.......so if a child pulls on the bow in her hair, the entire bow slides off the clip.....leaving an ugly metal clip in her hair.............i have gone through and put a bead of hot glue on each bow attaching the clip to the bow........this, done by the manufacturer would have made them a little closer to ""boutique quality"".2.  clips are not positioned properly on the bow - perhaps they were at first but since they were not glued, they slide around.  most of my bows arrived with the clip almost on the side of the bow rather than the bottom."
143093	they do flatten my butt oddly, but they work great on firming and smoothing the trouble areas for the more clingy dresses or just fancy occasions. make sure to check the size guide before buying these!
143095	"this shaper is very comfortable and effective for medium-level control. i bought it to wear under a fairly clingy dress, and the difference was immediately noticeable -- i looked like i'd lost ten pounds instantly. even though it's only medium-control, this shaper does a really nice job of holding everything in place and giving a nice, smooth shape, especially around the stomach and thighs. also, the top does indeed reach all the way up to right under the bra (and i say this being 5' 10"" and having a pretty long torso). one note: i went up one size over what the assets size chart suggested, and i'm glad i did: i think the smaller one would have rolled down on the top and up on my legs. as it was, the larger size stayed in place really well through eight hours at a wedding, but it was still relatively easy to pull down and back up when i had to use the ladies' room.the one drawback to this shaper is that it has a seam down the front which is slightly visible depending what you wear. it's not terribly obvious, but it's something to consider if you're picky and are looking for something to wear under fitted clothes. :) otherwise, it's a great buy!***update*** november 2013: another customer commented on my review that amazon no longer provides an assets size chart, which is really strange (it was available on the amazon page when i made my purchase in 2012). at any rate, you can find the current assets sizes listed here: [...] this is the same shaper available from another site with a link to the current assets size chart (next to the ""size"" field), and these are the measurements for each size:size 1: 4'10""-5'5"" 95-125 lbssize 2: 5'1""-5'9"" 125-155 lbssize 3: 5'3""-5'11"" 155-180 lbssize 4: 5'4""-6'0"" 180-220 lbssize 5: 5'4""-6'0"" 220-265 lbssize 6: 5'4""-6'0"" 265-295 lbssize 7: 5'4""-6'0"" 295-325 lbsi hope this helps you make your purchase!"
143096	expect it to roll down no matter what you do. i guess its fine if you plan on standing the entire time. i am tired of buying products that dont do what you buy them for.
143124	my best sunglasses, whenever i wear it out, a lot of people look at my glasses, in good mood my best sunglasses, whenever i wear it out, a lot of people look at my glasses, in good mood
143127	i use these for my 3 month old since she has a lot of hair and it tends to stand up. these look very cute on her and it comes in every color necessary for every outfit combination! they are very soft and don't cause marks on my daughter's head.
143129	these fit soft and comfortably on our newborns head, and i love all the color options that come with this set!!
143281	i purchased this bag in the navy color. i is definitely a cross between black and blue. lots of room on the inside with 5 interior pockets and 1 exterior. wish handles were longer so i could carry it on my shoulder, guess i'll just have to use the actual shoulder strap ;). overall, if you like large kisslock bags, this is for you. will be purchasing the green soon.
143282	this bag is perfect! yes perfect, it is chick, trendy, i can fit all my stuff including my mac book air lunch, etc and the best part the compliments instead of the usual big ugly bags this bag makes a fashion statement without trying to hard. best purchase ever. will have to go back and purchase other colors.
143290	the hardest part is putting this on and taking it off because the neck of this hoodie is a bit tight.
143291	i wished i ordered a medium but it feels so good on me. if the temperature is around 60, i'll get too hot, that's how thick it is for a simple sweater. not as trim as advertised but i love it.
143473	if you want to look like a boy - these are your pants. they did nothing for me. i was looking for a comfortable but classy pair of pants for casual friday. these are for working in a bowling alley - no offense, they are just too casual.
143555	"these slacks are perfect!!  i like the ""slenderizing"" tummy panel which is created by extending the pocket linings to the fly.  this creates a smooth finish with no pocket or fly gaping.  the fabric has a little stretch, but doesn't seem to bag.  the waistband is contoured to prevent the plumber effect.lee offers pants in both ""tall"" and ""long"".  long pants mean just longer leg length, while tall refers to longer all around - in the rise and the leg.i love these pants and own them in 4 colors."
143561	these are not true to size.  relaxed fit???!!  i ordered my usual size and could not even get them zipped.  they are so far from the size they're supposed to be, that i wouldn't even begin to know what size to exchange them for.  returning for a refund.
143645	"this chain will be heavy enough and is of sufficient length to go with the three layered stainless steel cross pendant i bought (see other review).  the ""crab claw"" fastener is easier to use than the ""round"" kind found on some of the chains. easy to shorten, if necessary, but i'll leave it as it is. decent price."
143648	i ordered this necklace in two different sizes and the one was super short. it didn't meet the measurements that were ordered so it may have been mixed up with the correct one. i kept it anyway and holding on for it in case i need an extra short chain for something, easier than returning it. the actual product was fine, just a mix up for what i needed.
143662	i read the reviews! i didn't listen......the worst, paper towel underwear ever!!!!never again. fruit of a loom you still rock!
143667	evidently, panty lines are an issue for some. i don't wear my pants tight enough that it matters, and i'd prefer a panty line to a thong butt any day.  (could just get a full coverage butt tattoo and have the same effect).  these are what i'd looked for, and these are what i got :)  very pleased. the fabric is thinner than some undies, but it's summer, i have a neurological heat intolerance, and these will be great.  they don't ride too low, and don't go to my armpits.  very pleased. i also like this brand, so knew what i could expect before they arrived.
143693	these vintage, some what antique look heart shaped neck lace watchesget me many compliments, i will order more as gifts
143713	this is a nice &#34;looking&#34; shirt, but i did not like the material.  it is as stretch fabric and it does not breathe.  too hot for texas summers and uncomfortable against the skin,  i returned this item and received a refund.
143807	"i ordered two of these chains and was surprised how thin it appeared. i own some other 1.5mm chains and they are significantly thicker. i think because it's singapore it's thinner than a more solid design. still, i needed a 22"" chain for some outfits and this fit the bill for an affordable price."
143817	hubby says they are comfortable, the waistband is not too tight and they feel good all day.  very pleased with purchase
143902	not too thick, not too thin, good for year round wear with sneakers or boots. wash well and haven't stretched yet (four months in).
144062	i already reviewed this purse, but here it is again. the purse is nice and exactly what i need. it's not cowhide. smells kind of funny, but that smell goes away in a week or so.
144092	the necklace is actually a lot thinner than expected, almost like a piece of  thin string! i won't be surprised if it snaps easily without much effort because it seems to be so fragile. oh well, my wife has been using it everyday without complaints but did mention that she would not order it again.
144141	it is a little small, but it does the job!  i like it better than using toothpicks to keep the clasp open
144166	this wedge looks great. i received many compliments from my girlfriends.i am a 8 and i bought an 8. i'm not sure i would go a 1/2 size smaller like other reviewers said they did because they would get tight on the side. the problem i am experiencing and the reason why i took 2 stars off is that when i walk the back of the shoe keeps coming off. they do not stay on the foot quite right. i would not wear this if i have to walk a lot but to be at the office and just walk around they are fine.
144217	"i usually figure that buying men's pants online is fairly easy -- waist and inseam.  in this case, however, the jeans were far larger than either indicated.  a 34"" waist seemed at least an inch too big (maybe bigger?).  and they were incredibly long.  i could have had them hemmed, but it would have been tough to adjust the waist properly.i liked the color, and the price point from amazon seems decent, or at least comparable to other lower-end jeans.if you were able to try them on, to identify your size (it's probably not what you usually buy), then i would recommend taking a look at these jeans.  alas, even after washing and drying (in an attempt to shrink the jeans) they are still much larger than the size would indicate."
144221	these fit very well. they are on the baggier side, to be certain, but that is the style. the color is very stylish, and the pocket design is simple but still cool. the only draw back is they need to be hemmed at least 5 inches on the bottom.
144261	the product is of great quality, color was as expected.  unfortunately my 8yo could not get into the size 12 as they were too slim.  depending on style he normally fits into 10 regular or 12 slim, but not these this time.  had to return them.  i gave 4stars because everything else about the purchase and return was as perfect as you could expect.  just needed a slimmer kid to fit into them.
144336	love this chore jacket! xl is a good fit, even if you are a size 12. perfect for outdoor work, walking the dog, or riding! top quality carhartt craftsmanship. i really do look like i fit in cowboy country too! yeeeha!
144588	the earrings are so pretty and they don't hurt the ears. i am very pleased with the purchase. they match the picture but look better in person!
144643	i purchased these shoes for my daughter in florida. her job entails spending much time on her feet and she complains of never finding shoes that are comfortable for those long hours standing on a daily basis.  well, she was thrilled with these shoes.  not only are they like walking on clouds but they are so stylish too, sometimes very difficult to find.  i would reccommend this product to anyone looking for comfort at an affordable price without having to sacrifice looks as a plus!
144651	why do i like  the spectator style? i don't know, it's probably the 80's influence on my development. had i removed the cardboard soles before wearing, my toes probably would have been more comfortable, but the shoes were cute with dress pants and top. great for standing, dancing, walking through hotel and parking for several hours at corporate event.
144669	i am 5'7 and 168 pounds; curvy physique.  i thought that this item would snatch me into place, however there was a little more slack than i anticipated.  it smoothed out slight wrinkles but it didn't grab as much as i thought it would.  i bought a size medium body-shaper from victoria's secret and it fit the same as this small. if i were to purchase again, i would go down a size smaller for the tighter look.
144886	they say silk in the description and then you get silk weight rayon. fake, small, and tight. my three yr old nephew likes it for a ninja mask and it fits him well.
144933	i love these! the colour is so vibrant and the quality is very good. they're decent tights but not sturdy enough for winter. i think they'll serve me in good stead throughout autumn though. they're very soft and also quite roomy. they'd certainly fit people who are quite tall. i'd also like to add that they're quite high-waisted, which i prefer but may not suit everyone.
145009	i purchased these shoes for work and so far so good. im on my feet all day long and they are holding up well. they seem to fit a little bigger than normal but they are still very comfortable and solid and they look sweet.
145014	my husband is picky about his sneakers because he wears them 7 days a week. i am picky about the price because he wears them out fast wearing them 7 days a week. these where a great price and a great fit. i should have bought two!
145028	i really do rate highly the whole range of winks girdles and find this one very comfortable. i was happy to add it to my ever growing collection. i now have a girdle for any occasion and really do find that they help me get back my figure. i look and feel slimmer from the moment i put one of the winks girdles on and that makes my self confidence rise. when i look in the mirror i see how much better i look, friends have commented the same too. try one for yourself, you won't be disappointed.
145039	i just received this watch today after ordering it on amazon and all i can say is wow! a great, back to basics, easy to read watch at a stellar price. i've been wearing g-shocks for years but they are now getting so big that i feel like they should be on my ankle (reporting my location to a parole officer) rather than on my wrist. for all the size, indestructibility, and various functions of the g-shock most of us still just use it to tell time. do we really need a watch that can survive falling from buildings, submersion to 20,000 feet, explosions, fire, floods, and locust? probably not. when this watch came out i was really please that casio was making a watch with the basic time telling features, in a smaller, lighter package and at a reasonable cost. the watch looks great! it's not too busy or juvenile looking and the face layout is logical and simple. the size is perfect! it's big enough to be easy to read but is very light on the wrist. it's very very comfortable and the band is finally big enough for a full size guy. the lug width looks like its either 16 or 18mm's so it will be easy to find replacement bands for it. overall i think casio has a real winner here!update: i've now had this watch seven months and its still going strong! the paint on the top and bottom of the bezel is gone, but the watch looks fine without it. there are a few scratches but this is to be expected. this has become by everyday go-to watch. i wear it to work and pretty much all the time unless i'm getting dressed up for something. still love the simple things in life!
145067	i use this for work. it has a snug fit, but doesn't make you sweat to death, while still hiding your face from those you don't wish to see it. a good buy.
145098	boy, i just could not wait to get these boots. i actually stood in the driveway waiting on the ups man. and when he came i dashed off inside to rip open my package and change my shoes for a wonderful evening on the town. they arrived just in time for my outing. sadly i was not able to change into them with any degree of happiness afterall. i first realized they weighed next to nothing. flopy & flimsy! to some it might be a blessing but to me i'd like to be able to feel my shoes and know that they are there rather than feel like i am barefooted. it would have given me great pride to wear a pair boots i knew were there!i decided what the heck and put them on rather hastily. as i was headed out the door ( some 5min later) my daughter asked me what was wrong with my boots. what do you mean what's wrong? i just paid over 100 for these boots. i looked down and noticed the left boot was dead. the tongue was flopping forwards to an alarming degree. i figured a few ajustments to the belt and i'd be out the door. wrong! i noticed the belt was at it's last notch. so i removed the other boot and sure enough it was also. hmmmmm? what now? oh no! i noticed the actual material was different on each boot. each one was sown with a different patterened grade leather. and then the belt. one belt on the left boot matched the material on the tongue of the right boot! each boot was totally different. even though they were sized both 10 one was actually a half inch taller than the other. then i noticed the thickness of the leather was different on each one besides being of different pieces. one boot had smooth leather the other did not. the tongue on one will never stay up it is so poor quality floppy. one belt was cut wrong, stretched and had factory uncut pieces still attatched and was cut at odd angle. there were also black splotches on both boots.neddless to say i was forced to keep my old farm & ranch mens boots on that by the way have never let me down!obviously these are not top quality items. and i am in the process of returning them.
145105	"so glad to find nice brown boots! these came only slightly darker in color than the online picture, enough that i can call it monitor difference. i was also looking for boots that came all the way up to my knee. these measure 19"" from the instep to the top of the boot, which could be too tall for some. for measurement purposes, my leg measures 18"" from the floor to the bottom of my kneecap, so i'm not sure how these fit so well, but they come right up to my knee without hitting it, front or back. this does mean people with shorter calves will have issues withe the height. they are comfortable enough with a padded insole added (my feet tend to hurt by the end of the day, so i use gel inserts) and look really nice. i'm happy with them but do have to argue with the reviewer who said they don't look synthetic. she doesn't own any vinyl shoes so i'm not sure how she's grading that, but i own both vinyl and leather shoes and these do look just a little like faux leather. they smell and feel like real leather, though, and while the leather is a bit thin and brittle when compared to, say, frye boots, still overall they are plenty of style and quality for the price. i'm pleased and would definitely buy these again. shipped super fast too. for this price range, if you can wear a boot this high it's a good purchase."
145231	i wanted to like this, i really did. but i can't. the top folds down quite a bit. i am a size 7, so i bought a medium originally. because it kept folding down on me, i got a large. that one was entirely too big all around. i didn't care about comfort. it works a lot like a sausage casing. definitely pulled everything in. just didn't stay up where it needed to.
145232	i bought these to wear right after having my second baby to keep everything...in place.  they are wonderful!  they are nice and tight (a bit hard to get on), but smooth everything out and provide nice back support as well.  i love that they improve my posture and make it so i can button my jeans.  the boyshort leg is a more comfortable alternative to a panty-leg because it doesn't pinch.  high quality material.  i have worn them under jeans as well as dresses and they do not ride up.  a must-have.
145245	this product helps to smooth some of the lumps and bumps.  does not do a lot for creating a smaller silhouette.  waist band does roll down.
145275	nice fit, your girls don't peak out the armpit holes!! but you better get on the bike or treadmill as it's for athletic type bodies, if you got a belly it will highlight it immensely!!!ive been working out using jillian micheals 30 day shred and riding a bicycle again after, well let's just say a few years away from it!!  so i purchased this to keep cool on 90+ days. well the little pooch sticking out made me look pregnant!!! ha ha. i kept the shirt for the great fit but won't be wearing it any time soon, til i deliver the pooch anyway!bottom line: comfortable, great fit, good cover for the girls! pricey.
145300	i bought this ring for a holiday party and i got so many compliments on it. it's big, yes, but it isn't too flashy. i definitely recommend this!
145308	"i also have the speedo men's sonic splice jammer swimsuit but it's 1.6"" longer in the inseam and i prefer the short inseam of this suit, the rapid splice. the color, styling, and fabric of the rapid splice looks great and it holds up well but don't sit on the concrete and take care of your suit. in addition to a short inseam, the fabric of the rapid splice is slighter different that the rapid splice. the rapid splice is a softer, shinier fabric. i'm 145 lbs, 5'9"" tall with skinny legs and the medium fits perfect."
145357	this is a great bow tie, no need to spend extra money.pros:1. makes a beautiful knot.2. easy to tie.3. (neutral) very thin material, thinner than average. if you tighten the knot hard, the knot will be very small.4. very silk-like. i certainly couldn't distinguish this from real silk.5. moderately shiny satin finish.6. stays neat for hours, even if you move around. this is a side effect of being silk-like, because the fabric has just the right amount of stickiness.cons:7. this tie is not suitable for neck size 14 inches or 14.5 inches. my neck is 15 inches and the smallest setting on this adjustable tie is arguably still too large. the result is a larger bow. if possible, i would tighten this another 0.5 or 1 inch.
145379	i purchased this watch for a gift for someone, upon receiving and opening it, i was shocked at how beautiful this watch was.  the picture does not do this watch justice.  i wanted to keep it just to look at it, lol. when i opened it all i could say was &#34;wow, how beautiful&#34; .  the people i bought it for was also taken by it's beauty.
145392	why would anyone pay $500 for a plastic watch.  even $45 is too much. i like the invicta watch i own; but, this is absurd.
145396	this watch is really nice. our only complaint is that the band seems kind of cheap. it is made of a light weight plastic material and the clasp comes undone real easily. everything else about the watch is nice - it keeps good time and it looks great, too!
145405	it is really hard to believe that they would try to sell this crap for 495.00 and then mark it down to 34.95.never again will i purchase this type of watch, i&#8217;m very disappointed in the quality of this watch. i have bought watches all over the world i currently have about 54 in my small collection and this will not be one that i will add. i am sending this back asap! as a matter of fact when i opened the box to inspect the watch it broke!  wth, amazon you need to pull this from your warehouse, if you don&#8217;t then you will get more complains&#8230;&#8230;this is a piece of crap!!!!!!!
145455	these boots are cute and comfy, not clunky.  unfortunately, they run short.  i typically wear a 7.5 (38) but ordered an 8 to wear with thicker socks.  even with thin socks, these were short.  i'll need to exchange for 8.5....
145535	these socks are a steal.  i bought dozens of them and saved many to give as an inexpensive gift because they are just so much fun!the quality is very good, which frankly, at these prices really surprised me.i highly recommend these, but if you walk around barefoot in socks like i do, try not go buy white.  :)
145634	i usually buy gap or calvin klein brand socks. those are the best. it's hard for me to get to those stores right now, so i thought i'd take a chance on these socks. how much different could they be? worlds different. the fibers feel rough on my skin, and yet they're really slippery on my hardwood floors. i'm going to replace them as soon as possible.
145688	dockers belt is made of a thick quality leather; yet it is very soft to the touch. the edging adds an extra touch of quality and attractiveness to the belt. my husband is very happy with it.
145698	i am a fashion blogger and stylist and i am always looking for cute stuff.  i love these  look great and i love the price and fast service!!! i am very happy and recommend it  to everybody especially to somebody who is getting married or loves beach chic
145762	i now have 3 pairs of these boots knee height, calf and ankle, this pair is my fourth. they are warm, comfortable and water proof (so far). delivery was on point, and to sum it up...i would recommend them. uggs are nice, ukala is just as nice, but cheaper. they are made by emu, which i believe is made by uggs...
145779	bought this for a girlfriend of mine for her birthday, just got the bag today and it is gorgeous!!! it is what it says it is in the description. you will not be disappointed, it may be pricey but worth it!
145799	bought this as one of my christmas gifts to my daughter-in-law and she absolutely loved it.  she dresses very stylishly and this lovely scarf fits in perfectly.  the scarf is also very versatile because of the multi-colors.  i highly recommend this scarf.
145850	i'm not sure what happened,  but i ordered the white and the ivory.  the white one is very soft and i love it.  the ivory one is not as soft and to top if off, the back is about 3 inches longer than the front.  i'll keep the ivory one and fix the hem and still use it.  if i order again, it will be another white one which is a great slip.  update 5-7-14:  i did order another white slip.  it was perfect and i love it.  i also took a chance and ordered a black one to wear with my black formal dress. the black was also very soft and nice. no issues at all.  i don't know if they have fixed the ivory slip issue i mentioned above, but i still have not ordered the ivory slip again.  but the white one and the black one is great!  i now have 2 white ones and 1 black one that i love since i've started wearing more maxi skirts.  i will probably buy another white one soon.
145976	these reebok's seemed like a really good deal for the money. unfortunately, they aren't the right size. their size 11 is really a 10. if you buy these, go up a size.
146058	i bought these for my 17 year old. they fit spot-on, and are well made. very impressed with these boots for the price - would recommend.
146065	i realize it's an unusual style but the &#34;fur&#34; lining was not comfortable at all.  and, the fit was loose and not at all like i expectted it to be.
146225	works just like my under-wired bras but so much more comfortable.good fit and appearance. no nipple show through either.
146227	i usually wear 36d (and occasional 34dd) so i tried this bra in 36d wanting a non-wire sleep bra that still was supportive and shapely.  i found this a little disappointing.  the band is not as firm as i would like (the picture shows it sting firmly in place) and it rolls under as i wear it longer, so i constantly feel i need adjustment by pulling the bottom of the band down in the front (this happens if i wear i on the loosest and tightest clasps.)  the cups then seem to sag a bit and aren't quite as full-coverage as the similar bali bra i have that is underwire. (that one fits great which is why i tried this one).  i already washed it before i wore this long term and decided it was just a little small (in the cup size) and that the bottom band doesn't stay supportive enough (it is not enough stiff elastic and feels like a loose fitting top of a pair of tights, if that makes sense).  i can still wear it and use it, i just dont love the fit, material, or shape.  the material is very soft and comfy.
146248	were a bit firmer; it's very soft and while comfy, doesn't provide quite the support needed for a fuller bust. but comfort revolution is right - i plan to get a few more of these!!!!
146268	this is the most comfortable bra i have ever worn.  i have worn this style for about three years now and will never go back to underwire.  the price was good at amazon; the delivery was quick and efficient.
146281	"this bra is comfortable to the point you don't realize you have it on.  i love it.  i'm not really a fan of any sort of padding in my bra, for shaping or otherwise, but i can live with it.  it has surprisingly great support.  i would expect a bra without underwire to be less ""up-lifting"" but this one does the job just fine."
146297	the cups are too large for the 40. i've tried other 40 d's and they fit perfectly. this one just missed the mark. not enough support to help fill the cup.
146301	returned because the upper bra cup was too large and &#34;caved in&#34; when wearing. i re-ordered in a b cup and it fit perfectly.
146327	the full coverage of this bra is not as nice as with the playtex secrets convertible smooth lift bra.  the cups squish and somewhat cut across cleavage to cause slight bulging. reasonably good fit and comfort for the price point.  enjoy the feel of the material and comfortable, wide straps and back straps.  there is some shaping padding in the cup and am very pleased to say that the bras are easily washable, ie, the soap rinses out reasonable well unlike some of the other bras i have.
146350	playtex has made quality products all along and this bra is as good as it gets, no wires so it's comfortable and feels plush. good colors too.
146357	i love this bra! there's no underwire but the support is great, and it really is smooth under t-shirts. i wear a c and i feel fully supported and comfortable. try it! :)
146371	i love this dress! the length is perfect, the color and the material as well!!! i would definitely recommend this dress! you won't be disappointed!!!
146372	loved it material, size, an color was perfect, was everything i imagined i am very pleased. it feels great everyone likes itplus i ordered other styles and colours.
146409	after years of wearing less than satisfactory department store bras, i was so happy to discover glamorise.  incredibly well designed and well made, great lift, looks nice.  somehow fits like it was custom-made (how do they do that?). totally smooth under even clingy clothes. love the cool mesh sides. stays put all day, no more tugging or slipping. my only (small) criticism is that the wide shoulder band only extends to the top of the shoulder. not sure why they skimped on that when the overall construction is superior. a great value.
146527	these are way cuter that what we thought,  bought for my daughter to match her yellow sundress.  super cute shoes!
146551	let's start with: i am a woman.  i do not normally wear men's flip flops.  i received these in the mail and threw them on my feet that same day.  the strap was too tight, but the toe part of the shoe was much too long.  i was tripping over the toe while the strap was cutting off my circulation.so yeah...  i have always preferred skechers cali flip flops.  i am bias.  i returned these and bought some skechers.
146553	bought them for my dad since he loves to wear flops in the summer.  he's always worn the $3 type from the dollar store, but now he doesn't let those things touch his feet.  he is very satisfied with these teva flops.  he is not a thin man, and even though the shoes have molded to the shape of his feet, they don't have that hard plastic emblem that some tevas have, so they are still comfortable for him.
146589	i was thrilled when this locket arrived - as other reviewers stated, it's very pretty and has a nice heft to it.  unfortunately, as soon as i held it up, it fell open.  the clasp (on the one i received, which could have been a manufacturing defect) was nothing more than a short prong - there was nothing to 'grab' the other half of the egg and keep the pendant closed.  i inspected it pretty closely, and also noticed the hinge had a lot of give and was pretty wiggly.  i didn't expect stellar quality for such an inexpensive item, but honestly probably would have returned this even if the clasp had worked - it doesn't seem like it would hold up for any length of time.  a real shame - it's pretty unique and i would have loved it.
146590	its wait to small the picture is deceiving... but other than that its really cute
146594	i was looking for a purse that wasn't too small or too big. this purse is perfect! it has plenty of pockets and fits well over my shoulder when i don't feel like carrying it in my hands.
146626	he originally wanted a different pair but i decided to buy these for him for his birthday.  he talks about how great they are every time he wears them.  said they might be the most comfortable shoes he's ever worn.  just tonight he said he'd wear them every day if he could.....he's a pastor so they don't exactly go well with suits and such.  however, he does wear them to work now with his khakis.he said they are light and breathable but warm enough to wear with socks in the colder weather.  great product!
146628	merch arrived quickly and in good condition. very cheap stuff. earrings are very heavy. i replaced the ear wires for the existing ones are like barbed wire!!! still a nice collection to the steampunk trunk.
146653	i am very happy with these studs. they are perfect and are so shinny. i love them. they are nickel free so they don't make my ears itch. that is great!! nice earrings.
146665	i'll make this short and to the point.pros: nicely constructed. quality materials. somewhat stylish (though a bit blocky). great heel support. lots of room for my toes.cons: i wish the strap had more give. i have plump feet, and the strap digs in quite painfully. an elasticized piece on the side or the option for adjustment (as simple as a slightly longer strap) would have been nice. the most pressing issue for me was the arch support. i don't know if it's the position of the support or the extent of it, but it digs in painfully into my arch. at the end of the day, i feel like i have a stone bruise on the bottom of my feet. this is not the norm for me either. i own several brands of comfort shoes (clarks, hushpuppies, naturalizers), and none of them have ever put pressure on my arch like the alegrias do.update:  i've since had these shoes for a few months, and i have to say that they fit a bit better now. i guess my feet have molded the interior fit. it still leans quite a bit into my arch, but the overall benefit at the end of the day is worth a little bruising. however, i cannot give it five stars because the strap is still an issue. better now (i've lost weight and apparently my feet have shrunk a bit too), but i know plenty of skinny people with plump feet and just think an elasticized portion at the base of one side would have been a smart move to make.
146676	i bought this shoe in my regular size but it was too small. i returned them and ordered a half size bigger, but they were still to tight throughout the shoe.  i would have ordered in a wider width but they don't come any wider.  i am going to return them and try to find something in the same style (which i really like) but comes in a wider width.  i would recommend these to anyone that wears a narrower shoe.  they are really cute and i think they would be a light comfortable shoe.
146679	i bought these because my old clogs are so worn out it was too embarrassing to wear them and these looked so cute!  i received them before the delivery date and wore them right out of the box.  perfect fit, so so comfortable and, yep, they are cute!  i feel like a walking advertisement!  everytime i wear them women want to know where i got them.  they are so worth the money.  love them!!!
146680	unfortunately, the arch on one of these shoes hit me at just the wrong spot or i would have kept them.  love the look of them, clearly quality materials.  i do believe this was a bit of a fluke, but since returns were not free, i didn't take a chance and re-order.
146788	this belt is better than i expected don't shy away cause it is dickies and don't spend more money on the name brand this is great
146789	excellent belt. superb quality. color is a bit darker than the picture.  true to size. they say order 1 size more than your pant. however for 44 sized guys there is no choice you need to get the 44 size belt which would fit you in the last 2 holes.
146790	the one sentries not look like picture then i asked dickie & they directed me to the actual manufacturer guess what they do, they ink it up with red then throw it in the dryer so not at all natural looking. stupid!
146849	i loved the support of this body piece but the butt is a pain in the butt! it needs to be either larger or more flexable. i have to be careful what pants i wear because there will be underwear lines. i bought this after a tummy tuck for support. i wanted the one piece because i didn't want the bottom to roll up and settle on my scars (which others have). it gave me the support i needed to heal but the butt... well you know!
146883	i am sending this item back. i ordered it to wear under dresses to give me a slimmer look, and compress in my stomach. but i found this to be no better than a tight spandex tank top. i didn't get any sort of &#34;compression&#34; effect, and it also did not cinch my waist as some reviewers described.i ordered the correct size too, so that wasn't the issue. just not what i was looking for. so i'm still zero for zero on finding a piece of good waist cinching shape wear... bummer... this may work if you're already fairly thin, and just want to hide a little pouch from having babies etc , but not if you want a serious old school girdle to really hold you in.-the search continues i guess .
146914	i haven't worn them yet because it has been too chilly, but they look good. i tried them on & they feel comfortable.
146926	i've had lots of teva's.  i love teva's.  these.... are ok.  they fit fine,  they look fine.  they're not uncomfortable.  they just don't have that amazing comfort level that teva's have.  and they feel kind of cheap, so to be perfectly honest i do think they're going to fall apart.  they were totally overpriced.  they are cute and they're ok for work.  and i do get some satisfaction from secretly wearing teva's to work :) but i won't be purchasing these in several colors like i've done with other styles.
146934	i am a real fan of tevas. i live in texas and like to wear as little shoe as possible. teva is like a flip-flop, but with an arch support. they are, bar none, the most comfortable and durable sandals i have ever worn. i have flat pair that i've worn for over a year, at least part of almost every day. they are still like brand new. when they get dirty, i throw them in the washing machine. they air dry overnight. i was so delighted that i bought a pair for my daughter. she is now a convert.i am enjoying the new teva mandalyn sandals also. i wanted something with a bit of a wedge heel. the arch support does not seem to be as pronounced in these, but they are still very, very comfortable shoes. i would (and have) recommended them to everyone!
146979	the foot bed of this sandal is extra-ordinarily comfortable. unfortunately, the shoe otherwise did not live up to my expectations. let me explain.i am a size 8c. a perfect 8 in length but just a tad wide at the ball of my foot. the width of these straps are generous & work well for me. however, the toe part just does not feel right and digs into my skin. moreover, the shoe is short in length and my heel is barely on the bed of the shoe. there is no way i would order up to a 9 because the shoe's toe box would be too long.overall, this shoe would best fit those who are in-between a whole & half size, and in that case - order up. but for whole sizes, i'm afraid the sizing is just terribly off.
147019	i was really looking forward to wearing this wonderful timepiece with its awesome looking leather band and eye catching silver bezel.i also felt great about paying only $45 for it too! but!.. then i noticed that the crystal had some kind of dirty looking film of something on the inside that looked like someone had forgot to clean it before assembly.yup! this very expensive watch had passed qc with a foggy looking crystal that anyone could see if taken a moment to look,so i returned it wishing i could keep the leather band to use on my other invicta watch that is perfect but has a synthetic band.i'm sure that my watch was just a screwed up mistake and yours will be fine...
147053	this bracelet is absolutely stunning; however, it catches on everything. it had caught on my nylons and ripped them to shreds. unfortunately, i had to take it off in the middle of the day. it was catching on my outfit as well. too bad because it really is beautiful.
147086	just received them today. i wear 10.5 and the 11s fit just right, so i agree they do run a little small. i have a med to narrow foot so they fit fine there. the straps are a little more snug than i'm used to but at least walking around my house they don't seem bad. hoping it stretches ever so slightly with more use. overall very happy with my purchase.
147112	i fit in most 11s but this sandal runs small. cute comfy flip flop though and my daughter who wears a 10 loves it! i will order one size larger.
147123	these are definitely not for people with wide feet, but i have narrow feet so this fit great.  they do run slightly small, but they fit well for me...snug enough to stay in place and not slip around.  the sole is very cushy and comfy, and the additional straps provide a little more secure fit, too.
147154	i loved the style of this shoe, minimalistic and simple, the shoe was very comfortable but the buckle by the pinkie toe cut into my toe so i had to return them. true to size.
147199	"first of all, want to say i received this product late. second of all, they lie. bought this as a one size fits all. take it out the packaging and there are ""large"" stickers on the panties, petticoat, and corset. being a small, these do not fit me at all! luckily, i just learned how to sew so i will be working on it last minutebecause it came one day before my needed date when it was due several days ago. overall unsatisfied ):&lt;"
147324	on my next journey of finding the perfect boxer brief, i went with these docker's based on people's review on amazon. when i first tried it one, it was comfortable at first but i noticed that the crotch and the gooch area felt baggy. i thought these were tighter fitting but i guess it isn't, probably because i'm asian. so i tried to pull them above my waist and now i have low rise jeans. i wanted to return these but amazon is nice enough to give me a refund without returning them but i really don't want to keep them.
147325	sent them back.  no opening for a men's product, really?  need i say more?  duh!  this is just a very dumb idea.
147381	a little loose across the toes but a good fit.  love the textured shoe case and love the colour!  very effective design.  great shoe laces.  great for zumba and other activities with spinning and varied foot movement as they slip just enough to on indoor floors to make movement easy and comfortable.
147413	i purchased these when they were a gold box value.  they arrived promptly but had what appeared to be black ink stains on the white rubber portion of each  shoe. before deciding whether to exchange or request a refund, i decided to try them on the treadmill.  they fit well, but after jogging for about 10 minutes, my arches were killing me! while i don't think these shoes would have caused blisters had i continued, there was zero arch support for my feet, and i felt that the impact to my arches was nearly as high as if i had run in a $10 pair of shoes. because these have such sparkling reviews, i imagine they are great for people with normal arches; however, i'd suggest reconsidering if you have very flat feet like i do. i will have to repurchase the twice the price new balances that i can run 5 miles in as soon as i pull them out of the box.
147429	this shoe is great for those who like a lightweight, cushioned minimalist running shoe and it comes in some great colors! i ordered a half size up because they run small.
147436	color is fantastic.  does not have the supportive arch the reviews raved about...not sure who wrote all of those, but second pair i've bought that were wrong.  these have decent ankle support, and fit snugly with roomy toe box.
147449	i have recently started doing a lot of cross-training with workouts like sean t's insanity, etc. and needed a better shoe than the old asics running shoes i was still using. i knew i wanted to stick with asics, and after reading reviews online these seemed like a good option without spending too much. ordered them in black, and love the way they look -- just like the picture. it offers a different color option for those not interested in the neon sneaker trend that everyone seems to be wearing.in general, i love how lightweight they are but think they could do more in the support area. i have a very high arch, so wish they were a little better in that area -- but on the other hand they have enough room to add inserts. no complaint about the shoelaces unlike some other people have noted in the reviews.
147462	are very comfortable for running and practice exercise every day.i recommended you to buy them.i hope in a future to buy others articles
147471	i ordered a 1/2 size larger as recommended by others and it fits just right.  the shoe is not as &#34;gelly&#34; feeling as the asics crosstrainers i normally order, but they are comfortable and they keep my foot in place during workouts.
147510	"the robe is fairly soft and warm, but it's definitely shorter than i thought it would be.  i'm only 5'4"" and it doesn't even reach my knees.  as far as what others are saying about the ""one size fits all"" being large, it's true.  but it's good.  i never am able to get into one size fits all items, and i'm large but not fat, so for once- it's nice to find something that fits.  i just really wish it was longer."
147521	very comfortable. they are bright and colorful just like pictured.  4 star rating is only because they r a little pricey for my college budget but when it comes to running the comfort of my feet is key.  i generally run in asics, they fit my feet great!
147627	"fyi. the sizes on these are not noted so here they are. 28"" pullman, 25"" pullman, 21"" pullman, & 17"" tote."
147630	these pants look fantastic. they fit like jeggings only they are much less expensive. i was concerned that they would shrink when i accidently put them in with towels. not only didn't they shrink, but there was no lint or &#34;pilling&#34; that often happens when an item is washed with towels in hot water. i highly recommend these scrubs.
147647	i liked the feel of it and i liked that it wasn't hugging me tightly. the only thing that i will consider in the future though is that they are a little warm so if you don't work in a cool environment, these may not be for you. they are just right for the fall/winter work environment. they also look great coming out of the dryer. love the pockets, they're comfortable and look really nice.
147659	have been looking for this type of wallet for a long time for my husband.  most we found in travel sites were small and didn't have the space for credit cards.  there was one review on this wallet where the gentleman actually tested it at work and that sold it for us.  it had been tested and it had all the features my husband needed.  not only that, i ordered it one day and it arrived the next.  great customer service.
147670	these look beautiful, i've had several people ask me if they were pandora bracelets.  i've had them for several months now.  the first bracelet broke immediately as soon as i tried to open the clasp, the second one has given me no problems at all.  i've opened and closed it several times.  i don;t know if the first one was faulty or if i just got what i paid for.very pretty, haven't tarnished even with constant wear.
147682	these shoes are soooo darned pretty. this was my second purchase and attempt at ordering my right size. the first pair i went with the size i normally have to settle for, because other manufacturers don't make my shoes accurate. i wear a 7.5 wide. although my first pair (8 m) were a little loose, but perfect with thick socks on, i was delighted with how good my feet felt after an 8 hour workday. when i saw these, my jaw dropped and i ordered them in my correct size. never before have i been so pleased with a shoe, made in my perfect size. so, if you are going to order any renova shoes, order in your perfect size, you will be amazed at how well these were constructed and how good they feel on the foot, even after many hours of work. i have to say, i have the best looking shoes at the nursing home.
147718	i got these today, the color is very true to the photo, the shoe is a bit loose on the heel, and only because my feet are so sensitive, the stitching hurts a bit, but i'm sure they will soften with time.these are absolute luxury!  excellent workmanship, nice thick rubber sole, i wear an 8.5 us, and ordered a 9. the length is perfect!
147721	i have never had a pair of jeans that fit me so well before. its low rise but the bold curve causes it to rise pretty high in the back, doesnt leave a gap and wouldnt expose your underwear. the fabric, stitches and overall quality matches up to levi standards which is pretty great. i read a few reviews that say that these jeans run small but i did not have that problem. its skinny jeans and supposed to hug your body! if your prefer a more baggy cut go for the straight legs cut instead. just measure yourself correctly according to the guidelines and follow the sizing chart provided and i dont think you can go wrong. i have 26&#34; waist and 36&#34; hips and size 5 fit me perfectly. and i love them so much that i got these in blue as well as black.
147756	wound it so many times but watch never worked. watch was definitely cheap. looked nice but pointless if it doesn't work.
147849	i've read some reviews before bought this item, some said the leather chain will become rigid after sink into water. i think it's because the chain is made of leather ;) i bought one for my lady and she wears it between her coat and sweater, it looks just great. both of us love it. will definately buy another one sometime. and the smile facein the package, made us laughed for quite a while. thanks a lot for the happy time it brought to us!
147864	a neat  and very attractive item indeed !fits perfectly into my wife's dresser drawer and holds all her jewelry
147883	bought this for a friend who 1: has everything and 2: loves gold. didn't know if she would shy away from the 'plated' idea, but she absolutely loved it! i wished i'd bought two ... one for myself! ;) enjoy.. great stocking stuffer.
147893	boots were delivered on time, and were packaged very well. i really love the boots, the color (rust) is as pictured, and they fit very well. the tassel on the back zipper is very cute, and gives them a unique look. these are an excellent value for the price, i have seen very similar boots selling for three times the price of these! they can also go casual or dressy. i highly recommend this seller, and will definitely buy from them again.
147961	this is a lightweight gown and the material is a little thin.  my only complaint is that it's tending to pill up a little and it pulls easily, but i sort of expected that.  it would also be nice if it had a pocket.  overall, i'm very satisfied with giving this product a 4 star and am pretty happy with it.  i got 3.
147969	this is a lovely nightgown.  i like the flutter sleeves because my arms are heavy so covering part of them is a personal preference for all of my nightwear.  i like that it has the satin hems . . . nice touch.  vanity fair and miss elaine have the best quality in my opinion.  i've bought flutter sleeves from discount mail order catalogs and have been very disappointed in the quality of the fabrics used . . . thin and don't stay smooth looking after several washes.  i recommend this brand and this gown.
148026	these sandals fit well. i had to order a size larger than mine since it does run a little small. awesome comfort. looks good. the down size with a larger size is my feet look bigger. but i prefer comfort over looks.
148116	they really look like old chuck taylors!  they fit my size 13's with no problem.  the come up a little more then mid calf.  the material is soft and thin but appear to hold up well.  these socks are very comfortable to wear both with and without shoes.  since buying these, i have ordered other k.bell socks.
148245	i am a 36a and ordered a large after reading other reviews but this was still way too small. straps too short and too tight around. i like the reversible barely there bra much better but was looking for a little more coverage with the foam cups. the large in the reversible is a perfect fit.
148246	i am 36d and use the xl. bought before, so knew size. i'm hooked on these bras. they are so comfortable for everything. for dressier thin fabric things i still wear underwires, but these are a great change in general for me.
148285	i was exited for this t shirts , i usually wear xxl and fits great but this is huge , i cant wear it outside ... watch the size and chose smaller than you usually wear
148303	this dress is absolutely stunning!!!i love it so much that i'm ordering one in most of the color's!!!i definately recommend!!!
148344	im a zumba instructor. i luv these shoes. this is true to size and has support although the design can be improved.light weight
148348	laces came with one end cut, as if from a razor.  i doubt it will last long, and there are nowhere to buy replacement shoelaces. shoes are not as comfortable as i'd like, but the shoes are very light (a plus) and that's physically impossible. if you want total comfort, you must buy a heavy or bulky and hot shoe.this was my second choice to the tsubo noma as far as looks, i want more ryka shoes to look like this.i took off three stars due to the shoelaces, theres no way you can lace these up and not see that defect, so it was deliberately used (hand thread) or cut afterwards (machine thread). when the laces go, the shoes will look odd unless i can find the dual-color laces in the short size used. no way.
148431	i ordered these in a half size up (i'm usually a 7.5 and i ordered an 8) based on the reviews on amazon and it was a good thing i did.  these do run a half size small so order up.  after putting these shoes on and walking around the living room, i really wanted to like them.  they are very comfortable both in the soles and also the soft elastic band running all around the top of shoe that keeps your foot securely in place.  seems like a shoe you could actually walk all day in.  however, even in the silver metallic color, they are frumpy.  something about the shape screams orthopedic shoe and made my average sized feet look very wide and potato-like.  if you're looking for comfort, then go for it.  but you'll be sacrificing all style.
148445	these are very cute, light as a feather, and seemed like they would be comfortable. the only problem for me is that it was a little tight around my toes (and i have a medium width foot). would work better for those with a narrower foot.
148500	"i wanted something i could use ""off road"" at the local nature center paths. i have tried a wide variety of shoes over the past year running the gamut from traditional cushioned to full minimal vibram's and merrell's. the kinvara 2's have become my favorites and the shoe i compared all others to now. the gel racer's compare as well as anythign else i have tried. they have a very simialr feel to the kinvara's. they are quite as lightweight and have a little greater heel drop differential, but they feel very similar on the foot.the gel racer's are supposed to weigh in at around 8.8 oz in a men's 9 which is about 2 oz's more than the kinvara's but still on the lightweight side of things as far as shoes go. the heel to toe drop is approx. 6mm which is less then most traditioanl shoes (10-14mm) but more then a true minimal which is usually (0-2mm). 6mm is a good compromise in my opinion. i wear size 12's and that is what i order here. i found the fit to be spot on and these are very comfortable.the upper is well made. seems to be better quality than the kinvara's. the heel offers gel cushioning which doesn't mean as much to me as i tend to run more on my midfoot and forefoot these days, but even on hard roads the rear of the shoe is very comfortable. the forefoot is not really that well padded, again in line with minimalism. the material is much tougher than that found on the kinvara. there is a rock plate enclosed as well. on actual trails the traction is great and padding fine. on hard road surfaces the padding isn't quite there if you are going on longer runs on a purely paved trail. 5k-8k or so is fine but i don't know if i would go longer on a hard surface. again though this is a trail shoe and on grass and dirt or a mix of trail/pavement this is a great shoe. i have run an 8k trail race in it in addition to training with it and the shoe performed very well.color is nice as well. i went with the purple, black, yellow and it looks great. overall a great shoe for trail racing."
148502	i only do light trail running and just finished a mud run in these.cons:1) fits a little small. especially in the upper just behind the toebox area on the top. basically the first shoelace. i've done the trick of flipping the shoelace over in the way it ties and so now with very thin socks, it works well. the rest of the shoe is true to size. i am currently wearing my true to size as i did try upsizing, but found that the place where the shoe bends wouldn't match my foot. so i deal with the slightly tight fit but just leaving the laces loose up front and tight at the ankle.2) a little stiff in the sole. this shoe does have a light rock plate along with a one piece outsole which stiffens the whole thing up. this isn't too bad a thing, but i would prefer a little more flexibility under the ball of the foot.3) picks up water fast. this is related to its ability to also drain it fast. see below.4) upper is rough. rough enough that along with the tight upper (see above), i have to wear thin polyester wicking socks, otherwise i develop blisters within 2.5 miles. i prefer sockless, but in the case of trail running where sand and pebbles can fall into your shoe no matter what, i guess running in socks is fine.pros:1) light for a trail shoe.2) heel drop feels even lower than the 6mm spec. feels more like a 4-5mm spec. this allows me to run very naturally.3) supportive but light. i'm not too worried about twisting my ankle or having my foot slip around much in this shoe.4) good protection for trails. toe bumper is strong enough for most toe-stubbing rocks and the mesh is like triple layered so scratches against shrubs and the like won't cut you. the asics logo itself is also good support and protection as it's firm.5) drains water fast. it's got 4 holes in the bottom of the sole and the sock liner is perforated. so if you go fully immersed in water, it'll fill up and after maybe 400 meters after as you squish squish squish it out with each step, the water is nearly gone. it's mostly your sock keeping water at that point and i haven't found it too unbearable.6) stylish? i didn't like the purple yellow laker scheme in the beginning but it grew on me and i've gotten compliments.7) durable and cleans super fast. i've hosed it out after every single run and the thing doesn't feel broken down at all and looks brand spanking new.
148621	so anyone looking at these may be familiar with c9 from target.  those are made by champion as well.  these are awesome but the c9s are a little more awesome.  so, in other words, you not going to go wrong with either and these are a little less expensive.
148732	i fell in love with this dress the moment i saw it and immediately ordered it. it was considered a 1 size fits most. when i got it, i found out that is not really the case. the dress is just not really proportioned for someone my size. i'm 5'1 and a size 4-6. even with heels on, this dress was just too long, and the halter ties were not long enough to compensate either, so i actually had to tie them off much lower than where the seam to the halters ended. the material feels amazing but is a little heavy. i still love this dress and have it in my closet, but i was a little put out that i would have to alter it so much to be able to wear it. if you are 5'6 i dont think you will have to worry about the fit at all.
148733	waaaaaaay too long and the pattern of the fabric prevents a decent enough hem not to trip, even in 6 inch heels (i'm 5-4), b/c the pretty pattern would be mostly cut away.  i love the fabric, the drape and fall, the bodice.  the pattern and the vibrant colors.  all very nice.  the pads?  eh.  folded over and smushed so's that you are better off getting them out.  if it hadn't been for the length of this dress, i'd've been wearing it all summer instead of stashing it in my closet.  :(  maybe someday i'll have enough skill to shorten it from the bodice end.
148740	i am a small d cup or large c cup and normally wear a size large. even so this dress is large on me (it stretches!) and i could have gone as far as small. double check your measurements to their chart and you will love this dress. so light and breezy! i do recommend.
148760	there is nothing special about this apparel. in order to lower the labor and material costs, ankle zips and back pocket to store an ipod or smartphone are never considered. the waistband does not include the drawstring cord. the ua logos are not embroidered, but fused; do not be alarmed, if they peel off in the future. you can find similar to this apparel at your local wal mart for less amount of money. machine wash cold water only. do not add bleach or fabric softener. made in central america. note: the vendor did not include the sales receipt/invoice for it. once this apparel is delivered, the buyer cannot return it for exchange or full refund.
148794	not pleased at all of the fit or the dull colors,not as pictured in photo,will keep but they are not what i expect from reef or amazon.not happy
148853	but.... it fits like a size 7.... i'm normally a 7.5 and that is what i ordered.  my toes are at the end of the boot and i'm probably going to have to return them.other than that the boot is really nice looking and a nice height/quality.
148917	i really wasn't waiting for such beautifull jeans!! they do fit perfect, the color is so nice.. i'm so happy with yhem, i'll order another pair.. i  just wish to find the same  but  rise an inch higher
148954	i bought a pair for myself since i have relatives that rave about crocs. i get why they do now. i wear a 6 1/2 and purchase the size 6 and it fit perfectly. the shoe is very soft and cushiony. looks great with jeans and dresses. can't even tell they are crocs.i think they other colors of this shoe are more shiny on the outside. these are not (which i am happy about). of course the only complaint is that your feet do sweat, but i knew that going in. would purchase another pair, and have recommended them to a friend.
148955	i am not really a crocs fan, but i do like some of their flip-flops and ballet flats. this particular shoe looks better in person. i usually wear 7.5 size shoes, but i went down a size, as suggested, and the shoes fit just right. also, i loved the price i paid for these flats. that's what i call a true bargain.
148972	i have a very weird size that not many companies make.  this is the best of them. holds it's structure,  gives great support and the pretty lace sides/ back are nice and wide and don't roll.  also covers up back fat well.  i haven't worn any of my other bras since buying these.  they also hold up well in the wash and keep their shape ( important when travelling), unlike a lot of my others
148976	this bra is nice material. it seems like it should last long and it fits as i would expect. it lost 1 star because it's not the most comfortable as the result of a bit more padding than i expected. this is a more natural shape than a lot of the victoria's secret bras. i will wear it a lot. the lace edge is a nice detail and it seems robust enough that it's not going to unravel. my only concern with the cups is that because all of the push up, that i will have gapping or when the cup sticks out instead of conforming nicely to your boob when it gets older.
148979	i have tubular breasts so finding bras that fit are kind of difficult. they will normally gape at the the top. this one does a really good job at lifting mine from the bottom and sides to make them look more rounded.
148986	out of the box the first thing that comes to mind is wow! the invicta men's model 1278 makes quite an impression. as an owner of several other invicta classics, this one is seriously worth a second look.powered by japanese quartz movement, the 40mm stainless steel case cradles a face with three sub dials including 60 second, 60 minute and 24 hour displays. the date display is nicely added at the six o' clock position. the silver toned luminous hands are a great touch and actually show up well in a darkened room. the bezel is unidirectional.usually i'm not a big fan of metal bands. the stainless steel band with its fold over safety clasp is actually quite comfortable. it held up well and passed an unscheduled test when i forgot to remove it while playing racketball. i was quite surprised that it didn't go flying. still i don't recommend this test. as far as water resistance goes, invicta claims its a go up to 165 feet or 50 meters. personally, i wouldn't bet on it.the invicta model 1278 comes nicely packaged and includes a one year manufacturer's warranty, a five year extended warranty application and product id card. the florida based company offers an informative website with customer support numbers and email links. there's also a repair pricing chart posted on the site.even with the stainless steel metal band, this invicta watch is a welcome addition to my growing collection of time pieces. it sells itself.
148989	i like invicta watches. they offer a lot for the money, and the ones i've owned perform as well as watch i've worn. the invicta men's 1278 ii collection chronograph silver dial stainless steel watch is distinctive in that it hits the sweet spot between casual and dressy. i wouldn't hesitate to wear this timepiece with a suit or tux, and yet it also looks just right when i'm on the golf course or sharing a bucket of wings with my buddies.the main feature of this watch, aside from the chronograph (60 second, 60 minute and 24 hour subdials) and date functions, is the reasonable case diameter. i still puzzle over the 60mm case that some manufacturers (invicta being one of them) release to a disbelieving market. i know they sell a ton of these mammoth things, but i can't remember the last time i saw somebody wearing one. the 1278 ii collection watch has a sensible 40mm case diameter, which looks pretty good on my large wrist and pretty good on my son's slightly thinner wrist. and that's important, because i promise you this is one watch you will actually want to wear everyday.
149008	these shoes are comfy and super cute.  the only problem i have with them is that they sit to the right too far on my foot.  when you look down wearing them they are off center.  that just might bug me becasue i'm ocd.  if you don't care they are a bit off set you'll love them!
149052	i've had several different brands of zip around wallets - from the very expensive to inexpensive.  some have a tight fit for credit cards, creating a tug of war at the check out counter; some have zippers that literally will chew up your fingers as you maneuver money and cards out of the wallet and some have bad zippers that just don't last the life of the wallet.  this classic black wallet has a smooth zipper, it's lightweight, has plenty of room for cards, a special clear spot for your driver's license and lots of slots for money, receipts and my lists that i'm always carrying with me.  i'm very pleased with this wallet and if and when i need another, i'd head to vera bradley for a another - maybe in one of their fun prints next time.
149092	great price.  great looks.  great fit.  wore these on our last vacation to st. marrten.  great beach shoe, but better &#34;off the beach shoe&#34;.
149104	they fit perfectly and comfortable from the moment i slipped my feet into them.  i already have this same sandal in a beige that i purchased 3 years ago so i knew they would fit
149129	this is my first pair of crocs and i am glad i waited for a much cuter, more petite looking style than the original. comfortable right out of the box and durable. i have been wearing them all summer and they still look nice. the black does come off on bare feet and if your feet get wet, you will squeak when you walk. but as expected when wearing a rubber shoe.
149147	i bought this model because expresso color is a color that can be combined easily and because i have other sandals croccs a similar model called malindi in blue and have proved to me that the most comfortable sandals ever had there. so i decided to buy this model. the've tried and although they are a little tighter than the model malindi, are equally comfortable. they are perfect for the beach, rainy days in the city, to walk many hours ... i actually prefer these sandals to sports shoes, i feel fresher, more comfortable. plus they have a great price which makes them very attractive are very versatile, anatomic sole is really no bother and no part of the foot. i recommend them 100%
149176	as expected, vanity fair still provides a great quality product.  although this particular style is new for me, the fit was great and the fabric is soft and super confortable with absolute no seams.
149200	the scarf seems to be made very well and is soft and comfortable.  the red is a 'true' red, not orange-y at all.  i would recommend this item.
149291	i bought these for camping and have discovered how great they are for going to the gym; camping, kayaking.  my feet love the massages
149353	washed and dried well over night in the hotel bath room so one needs only a few of these for a trip.
149381	these shoes were actually slightly smaller on my foot than anticipated. hurt feet. disappointed fit on foot, bought this brand before
149394	okay, i have to admit that i haven't worn these shoes yet.  but i've had all positive experience with ryka.  these shoes are very light, have some arch support, and feel great, so i don't anticipate any problems.  plus, they are priced reasonably, and cheaper through amazon than on ryka's site.i was concerned about size because i have flat feet, so i usually wear a wide shoe.  but i looked on my last rykas, and they are a 7m.  i called ryka to try to find out how the dash model fits, but got no help.  i know that ryka's are wider in the toe bed than most shoes, so i took a chance on the 7m, and it fits just fine.
149418	i shop for new sneakers seasonally in a brick and mortar.  i have a narrow heel, high arch, need room in the toe area and tend to wear down the outside of my heel. i no longer have adequate cushioning in my feet and get burning and tingling  in the balls of my feet (morton's neuroma). custom shoes caused more pain.  usually when i buy sneakers for walking and the elliptical i need to add insoles right out of the box. i usually size up to allow the over-the counter orthotics. my last pair, sketcher's were a little clunky and stiff.these have nice flexibility, my foot does not slide around in them.  nice room in the toe box, the heel does not slip, and best of all i have needed no innersoles to make these more comfortable.  i have worn them on brisk walks outside and on the elliptical, as well as when i do my leslie sansone walk-at-home video.they are holding up well. the thoughtful reviews written by everyone here helped me make my choice.i plan on purchasing this brand again!
149526	i bought my first pair of these sandals in rome this summer - my feet were killing me after walking around.  i have plantar faciitis, like most people nowadays, and these were the only shoes i could stand to wear the rest of the trip.  when i came home, i bought a second pair.  they mold to your feet, so after a lot of wearing, they get a bit squished, which is the only downside.  the straps are cushy, which is great - no plastic!
149533	pros:- reasonable price- appearance- pretty comfortable (although not as soft as the puma whirlwind)cons:- sizing runs small. i normally wear a 9 but they were too small and i ended up giving them away. make sure you get at least a half size larger than your usual if not more.
149618	who hasn't tried to guess what size today's shoes are going to be? because, unlike years of past. sizing is all over the place. and every year changes. i have last years scetchers similar to this style, in a half size larger, and these seem the same size. i have new balance shoes in a whole size larger, and seem the same size (putting the bottoms together) if i was to guess at this size, you could get by with a half size smaller if you have toes that don't spread out a lot (more cone shaped) the reason for that is because this has a fairly wide toebox. my last years model ( the suede wh45903) has a normal cone shaped toe box (which my toes are more shaped.)the comfort is to die for! the in sole is soft and has a nice arch. the heel is very low, not as much as minuimist shoe, but close to it. the sides of the shoe have a soft comfy feel. the top of the instep is lower. i have high arches and if that shoe top comes up over it, i get a sore on the top of my foot. besides, shoes look better on a leg if that doesn't come up high, it makes the leg look longer.i wish amazon prime had other colors then the black, as i would buy another pair too. at the other color prices here, i can do better on a sale in the local store chains.
149624	everyone that i work with has these shoes and loves them. unfortunaly none of the retail stores carry a size 5 m. needless to say i was thrilled when i saw my size on amazon. i ordered size 5 m, what i received was size 5 w! i am really upset about this and don't know who to send them back too. if you don't have the right size dont send any!
149650	"these shoes run wide and short, but that is the least of their problems as far as i am concerned. i was very disappointed with the whole look of the shoe....very cheap, thin material and no support. i don't understand why this is called a ""walking shoe"". who could walk any distance in these shoes? i would only wear them as an indoor house shoe/slipper, and actually, not even then. i am sending the shoe back, very uncomfortable and kinda ugly, actually. just ugly."
149779	i have always bought sketchers loved the shoes. i have multiple pairs and have always been very pleased. i bought  a pair of sketcher to go on a walk. hence &#34;go walk&#34; but i have had some trouble with these shoes. the first time i slipped them on they were like wearing slippers. i love the comfort on my feet but they have little support for your body when you are walking. the first time i took them walking i finished the walk with a blister on the bottom of my foot. i was rather shocked because i don't generally have difficulty with shoes or even sketchers. i have used them again to walk but i continue to feel that lack of support. although these may be good for many people. i did have some definite problems with these shoes. i am pretty disappointed. i gave them a three star because they actually feel great on your feet.
149858	i had to return them, i felt like i was sliding around in some clown shoes. i typically wear 5 in flats, 6.5 in athletic shoes but i had over an inch of room in the these.
149859	this is my personal go-to running shoe.  it isn't all jazzed out with bright colours and bells and whistles, but it never disappoints.  very light, fits like a slipper, just enough arch support for a slightly aged arch, plenty of toe box and wiggle room.  i may try other styles and brands once in a blue moon, but i always go to this shoe when i don't want to take any chances before race day!grace runner, sacramento, ca
149916	i am wear asics mostly, but needed a second pair of shoes (who doesn't) as a backup.  based on the previous reviews i decided to give these a try.  i prefer a wider toe-box for my wide feet and i normally wear a size 10 women's shoe, ordered the 10.5 based on reviews and they fit great.  very comfortable right out of the box, no breaking in necessary.  the color is a little more blue then purple which isn't a big deal, i like blue better anyway.  i wear these for zumba and i don't have a lot of sliding around in the shoe, feels pretty stable.  great value, great shoe!  would recommend to anyone and would definitely buy again.
149945	these shoes aren't that great looking, they look like house slippers on.  but that's not my main complaint with them.  they are supposedly designed with crossfitters in mind, but they also contributed to injuries.  the completely flat heel created an issue with the tendon in my foot, causing it to start to pull away from the bone.  not ideal for those that are flat footed, you need some sort of arch support.  also, the flat heel creates more hip flexion when squatting (to get lower) which lead to some irritation in my lower back after wearing them for a few months. i stopped wearing these shoes & now my back & foot aren't hurting.  completely flat is not ideal...
149986	i love merrell sandals and i wanted a white pair.  but this style did not fit me.  the sole was correct, but the upper portion was too loose.  i had to return them.
150014	i received these adidas as a gift.  i very happy with them.  they are true to size, very light, and look awesome.  i love these shoes.
150019	this shoe is awesome for running.  i feel these are better than the saucony shoes i used to wear.  there is just enough cushioning and medium bounce in these shoes.  i normally buy .5 size larger in running shoes, but in these i did not have to buy up.  buy your true street shoe size.  there is good support for my medium arch and the heel cups my heel perfectly and with this shoe my ankles get the proper support and do not feel weak after running.
150025	fine for walking, but for running, the bump in the middle felt wrong.also, just not enough cushion for me (it's a barefoot style shoe so less cushioning is to be expected, i suppose).apart from that, they are nice and roomy, flexible and light weight, kind of ugly though.
150050	i bought these on the good review of another customer but the shoe is made for people who have shorter toes and wider feet than i have. i have been a buyer of teva for many years and find their sizing better for my feet which are longer and slimmer than the average foot. i usually wear an 8 in teva but i found the toe box in merrell size 8 too short. i re-ordered a 9 but it is way too wide.i would like to add that i will not be returning these sandals because the cost would be too high from canada...probably around 35 dollars so the cost is not worth it for me.i am, however, still very happy with the service at amazon.com.
150134	my husband like to go hiking and fishing so this shirt is great. color is true to picture. for size, just make sure you use the size chart and you will be fine.
150195	i love my sandals, my boots and all the other shoes i have from merrell. they are the best shoes that my feet have ever worn!! my feet are not the best, matter of fact i have orthotics. i do not even need to wear them when i wear my merrells. love the shoes!!
150230	i am happy with this hat as it will keep the sun away when i don't want it....it fits very well as it is adjustable...thank you
150253	bought for a trip to disneyland on a 100+ degree day.  i wanted something cute but really practical.  this fit the bill.  it has mesh on the back and near the pockets, so the cotton doesn't get damp from sweat.it has two sets of pockets and the tie around the waist is cute.it also has velcro on two of the hand pockets as well as the breast pocket (which is actually large enough to be functional.)it has an additional button across the bust to help keep the dress from gapping when you move around.  it's definitely designed for comfort/mobility.i laundered it and it still looked great, no ironing required.
150254	i ordered this item for my wife as a gift. she likes very much. and i really appreciate the customer service for helping me get this order on time.
150327	i used to sprain my ankle about every three months, despite weekly physical therapy, strengthening exercises, ankle braces, extreme care... you name it. my ankle would just go. so for the past three years, with a handful of exceptions, i have been wearing vibram fivefingers all the time. current favorites are the bikila ls, the sprint, and the rei leather ones. not a single sprain in the last three years.however, this past week i had a meeting that i absolutely could not wear fivefingers to. i spotted these in rei and went for it, and i did wear them nearly all day. from the perspective of a dedicated barefooter, however, this isn't exactly an ideal barefoot experience. my small toes were noticeably cramped despite plenty of room at my big toe. the rest of the shoe was somewhat swimming on my foot, and i worried that the footbed would slip around on me on uneven pavement. (the source of many a sprain, historically.)on the bright side, the sole is the nice and familiar vibram 4mm sole, nice and flexible and responsive. the shoes did not push against my vulnerable achilles tendon. while i would never reach for these in any situation that i could get away with wearing my vibrams, they were a cute and passable alternative. i will be getting more colors for future emergencies.
150383	very good quality like lacoste. but cheaper .........let me see what happens when i wash it . i hope it doesn't shrink .........
150440	this is a very cute shoe.  i bought this pair of shoes mostly because i have rheumatoid arthritis and another person who wrote a review said they had the same and these shoes were super comfortable.  i wore them to work and by 3pm i was in pain.  the sole seems to be solid wood and even though they have cushioning on the bed of the foot after a long day it wasn't enough.  once i got home and took them off i was in a lot of pain all night and the pain even woke me up at 2am and kept me up for a few hours.  i would not recommend this shoe.
150486	"invicta model 1429i've been curious about invicta watches for several years, and have purchased fossil and casio g-shock in the past without any problems. i decided to give this invicta a try, just to get an idea of the quality and workmanship. to make a long story short, the actual street price of the invicta is too high for the actual quality and workmanship. you're better off buying fossil or seiko for the price because they have much better quality.let's start from the beginning. the invicta 1429 is an analog chronograph watch, where you can set the date and time. there is a smaller gauge that tells the 24-hour time (to distinguish pm from am). the remaining 2 gauges are used to indicate chronograph seconds (0-60) and minutes (0-60). the main watch is your standard 3-hand setup for second, minute, and hour. while the watch itself looks good from afar, up close the back of the watch and the face look/feel cheap. the chronograph hands don't line up with the indicated tick marks. there are no tick marks for the main clock so i can't tell if they line up. the watch band is made of very stiff leather and seemed like an afterthought when they fitted it to the watch. the notches aren't cut all the way, so if you have smaller wrists the watch is too big. the chronograph buttons aren't tactile, so i had no idea if the stop watch was active.the instruction manual was useless for this model. after flipping through it, i eventually stumbled across a folded insert marked ""operation vd 53 b"" which had the actual instructions for this configuration of watch.  the 1429 arrived with the chronograph not zeroed properly, so i had to recalibrate the hands. the msrp tag was a joke, as it exhibited a cost about 10-20 times what the actual value of the watch should cost.the positive aspect is that the watch could pass as something expensive or classy, but the level of quality isn't there. it made my fossil watch look like a much more expensive precision watch, and the watch aficionados consider fossil to be cheap mall watches. the glow-in-the-dark inserts on the watch glows a subdued white-blue color, which is actually kind of cool compared to the boring green that most watches use to simulate mil-spec tritium ""diver"" watches.overall: 3/5 stars, the chronograph hands don't match up to their tick marks and seems to change with every revolution, it arrived out of the box with the hands not calibrated/zeroed properly, and the watch band isn't very good."
150528	i first ordered a size 4/27 but didn't read the reviews first. they do run about 2 sizes bigger and so i gifted them to my daughter. i ordered these in a 25 and they fit amazing!!
150586	i like the design of these shoes overall.  the detail on the sides looks nice, and the overall finish/color is good also.  my main problem with these is how poorly padded the heel area is, where it wraps around the ankle at the top.  the inner material of the shoe and the outer material meets at a sharp point of stitching, coming to too sharp of an edge.  also, there is not enough padding material in the same area, so the part that wraps around the ankle at the top is too thin also.  i just couldn't see myself wearing these and enjoying them so i returned them.
150587	i rated thr shoes at 5. this a sharp looking pair of dress shoes. the comfort is unbelievable. i highly recommend them to any man who wants to look good and be comfortable in his shoes. excellent value!!!
150626	i purchased the mini last year and this year the baily.  i think they would look cute with skinny jeans or leggings - but i don't where those often.  i don't recommend wearing these with jeans because it is wider at the top than the mini.  but it is very cute - wish i would've got the lighter color.  comfort is excellent and i do love wearing them.
150631	they run a bit bigger, but that is perfect for those that need to put orthotics in them!  i could not wear uggs because they have absolutely no arch support, so i'm grateful i have the extra little bit of room!!  also keep in mind that with time they will stretch a little. they are comfortable, soft and warm. love them!

150686	finally, i'm not going to bed with achey legs and an achey back! i'm a stay at home mom and am on my feet much of the day. i no longer have the problem of achey,  tingly legs when i finally hit the sack. worth every penny. i got them in pink and they're a cute delicate pink. wish i'd gotten them in a darker color, though. dirt catches in the crease where my foot bends and i can really see it with the pink.
150714	i loved the make and look of this shoe. i normally wear a 7.5 so i went with size 38. it fit fine until i tried to walk around, run on the treadmill or just row with these shoes on. my left foot hurt terribly for days and i just wore them once. so i obviously had to return the shoes.
150730	these shows are very narrow for there size.  i will never buy these again.  i wish i would of saved the box to send them back
150735	i have had mine for about 2 months.  they are plenty comfortable as far as the sole.  they are extremely hot.  my feet sweat like crazy in them.  the faux-suede surface started rubbing off almost immediately.  i wear mine for house shoes so i don't care that much but it would be nice if they looked good.
150789	"these elegantly decorated, delicate-lavender slides are a stunning asset to several of my outfits. they are ""earth shoe"" healthy with an upscale ""dressy"" look. i found the arches a bit uncomfortable on first wearing, but the instructions say it takes time to acclimate to them through shorter periods wear initially. and they come with a 30 day ""comfort guarantee"" so i am not concerned.  i was so dazzled by their beauty that i didn't realize they were orthodic. happily, orthodic is a plus for me and they do seem to align my body better."
150884	bought this boot to wear for everyday and it has been very confortable.  i would buy this again. stylish under jeans and work pants.
150886	i love these boots from clarks!!!! they are super comfortable, very nice looking and very good quality!! they look great with skirts, dresses or pants. they arrived very quickly :)
150889	i was lucky enough to get these on a great deal so i bought both the grey and the brown. i am so glad that i did! they are very comfortable all day and the upper shaft is soft and bendable. why would this matter..? i had a pair of black naturalizer milano boots (with suede at top) that i couldn't drive in very long because the upper part of the boot was hurting my chin cause it wouldn't give enough to let me step on the gas. if you have skinnier calves maybe you'll like those, but the leather on these is much softer. i have arthritis and ankle edema sometimes and these are awesome! they fit everyday and are comfortable everyday, no matter what my feet are saying. i could tuck pants in.. but they are fitted enough at the top to wear with skirts too. i love the fact that the majority of the suede is up high so i won't have to worry about walking in puddles and they won't show wear as quickly as plain suede. i thought that i wouldn't wear the grey ones very often, but i have stumbled across lots of outfits they look great with. they are a little bit lighter grey than what i imagined from the picture, maybe a dove grey. if your foot is narrow and you don't plan on wearing them with thick socks..if i had to guess..you probably won't like these much. i have a narrow heel and wider forefoot and i love them. it's hard to find dressier boots with a comfortable heel height..these are just right!here's the link to the other boot mentioned:naturalizer women's milano boot
150918	every weekend i am running to and from kids softball games, birthday parties, visits to grandma, the grocery store, you name it. this will be my go to for the spring/summer/fall months because it can be dressed down or dressed up or worn as is and still be appropriate.  i love the racer-back design and fit!  buying it in every color today.  to give you an estimate of the sizing, when i purchase from walmart, i order a large (us 12/14).
150953	this is my second pair of these kind of jeans, but the other pair is the paley bootcut.  i love the fact there is no zipper to make my already round tummy look even rounder, but i actually would like them to be even higher waisted in the front, not dipping down in a curve.  i like vintage style and if there is a zipper, i want it up the back, which is way more flattering and flattens the stomach.  this denim is soft and really nice, though.  i got black, which is not really black, but navy with black overlay, so don't expect jet black.  i have a lot of jeans and prefer these.  next best thing would be custom, so this is good pair to buy.
150966	i am 5'6&#34; and accustomed to buying pants that must be hemmed to wear with flats, etc.  these pants are extremely long and should be labeled as long or tall.  i even tried them on with my 3&#34; heeled pumps and the pants were bunched-up on the floor.  as far as fit in the waist and hips, they are normal.
150990	i'm 5'4&#34;, 130 pounds - the medium was a very good fit for me, and i will use it as an under-layer.  really love the omni-heat technology and have invested in several garments using it.  so nice to have warm clothes that are not bulky!
151028	nice jeans.  good heavy fabric, slimmer fit around waist and thighs, with enough room at the cuff to drape nicely on the cowboy boots.  fits true to sizing.
151067	these may be awesome socks; i don't know because i'm returning them.  i needed a plain-looking sock and the product image showed the khaki and other colors to be unadorned with graphics, decorations or differently-colored threads.  however, the khaki socks i received are covered in darker-colored graphics. good thing amazon's returns are so easy. btw, i did try them on, and the medium is borderline too small for my men's 7.5 (us) foot. you may consider going up a size if the chart shows your foot is at the upper end of a size range.
151069	i have been wearing the over the ankle version of this sock this summer and have liked them a lot.  not too thick, not too hot.  the double layer has made up for the lack of thick padding on the sole.  the crew version looked promising, so i bought one to see if they were going to perform as well.  i washed them before wearing the first time.  they came out of the drier a bit frayed, especially on the front of the shin.  not pretty.  will see how they wear.
151072	i was looking for a shoe for regular casual use that i can wear to work on casual days. this shoe is very comfortable, light weight and looks good with jeans. i use this very regularly and i am very happy with the fit and comfort. for $ 60, it is a steal. i was never been so happy with a shoe before.
151172	i have dozens of nine west shoes, all size 7, so i am pretty comfortable buying nine west shoes online thinking they always fit. not the case with this one. i could barely squeeze my feet into it, and i do have narrow feet. i could not even walk in it, it was that short. and the front is very short as well. you cannot tell from the picture but it is more like an almond toe type. it does not look nice at all. i wanted a more classical pump, and this is not it. however if it was not uncomfortable i would have kept it since it is a basic black shoe and they do not last forever so why not. i recommend trying half a size bigger, but since the style is not my favorite i do not want to try a larger size.
151232	super comfortable! high quality. stood in front of a microphone and sang with my band for four and a half hours while wearing these. no discomfort whatsoever! well worth the price. the fur looks and feels real too.
151264	i've worn these shoes maybe around 10 times and both of the soles are starting to peel off.  they look great otherwise and i get compliments on them whenever i wear them... too bad the are pretty much unwearable already.
151297	i do not even know how to begin describing these pumps. they look ever better on your feet! mostly pumps with platforms can look tacky and classless but not these ones. these are breathtaking! they are high but comfy. got them in black first, and then red and brown those are how awesome they are. i receive so many compliments anytime i wear them.get them. get them now!!!highly recommended........after wearing these for 2 months i am back to say you may want to go a half size lower than your regular size..they are coming off my feet. now i have to wear them with insoles now.
151327	i really like this tee. it is a little more on the fitted side than a lot of other tees. usually wear a small but sometimes need a medium. fit perfectly. i like the longer length. my bust measurement is 37&#34;.
151364	ok, ladies...this is not as cute as it is on the model....the material is very flimsy and it's pretty complicated getting it on. it also does not look flowy, however the print is very cute.  if you're looking for something inexpensive this may work for you, it just does not work for me.
151380	this just arrived and i cannot wait to wear it! i tried it on at home and this is super flattering once you figure out which side to slip on first so the tag won't show. the arm holes i found to be comfortably snug - they need to be or this would not stay on. the front v can adjust and this snugs in at the waist. i'm a 34dd, size 8 and the m fits perfectly! i ordered solid black and this reaches just above my knees. the back scoops nice and low, just above my waistline. this will be an awesome beach dress/coverup!edit - i took this on vacation with me and the black left black marks on my shoulders! i would definitely recommend washing this before wearing it! otherwise it was a bit challenging to put on after pool/ocean time. but it is cute and very flattering, i saw several other people on vacation who had similar albeit different colored wraps like this. the material is ideal, it's quick dry and does not change color when wet.
151428	comfortable. great price through amazon. sharp looking boot. the calf is a bit large for me, but the regular is too snug. i'd rather have more room.
151520	i was pleasantly surprised how attactive this watch is.  it works very well and is an inexpensive alternative to those expensive skeleton watches.
151563	when i run, i want to feel like i am running on a cloud of air. these shoes do not fit that bill. i walked around my house for about 10 minutes and the toes on my left foot began to tingle. my foot felt like it was standing in wood clogs (the cushioning is that stiff). i love saucony's and have ran in them for years, but this is not my shoes.
151581	weird title, i know.  we generally always buy our younger kids stride rites, for the quality, looks and comfort.  this is the first time i had to send it back for looks.  the picture is adorable.  the shoe did not look as good as the picture.  the paint was seemingly splattered haphazardly.  the leather appeared to be cracking.  i seriously wondered out loud if i had received a knock off. ended up going with the sheena and all is again right with the world
151652	i was hoping these would become my new go-to summer shoes for walking around all day.  but no, they are so ugly, i just couldn't stand it.  they look like birkenstocks.  just awful.  and not really as soft/comfortable as everyone else is saying.  they're going back immediately.
151691	ordered 9 ee based on past experience with this shoe. given that kinvaras fit snug / narrow in the toe box this gives me the room needed.
151692	i decided to go with kinvara 4 as i've never owned saucony running shoes before and wanted to give it a try.  light weight was attractive,the shoe being neutral runners shoes, and the lowered price made it an easy choice.  first 10-15 miles went well but the problem began within last 6 miles or so.  i started having itbs,  iliotibial band syndrome, which i've never had them before.  my cores are strong, and i ran on my 4 yr old running shoes and never had any issues.  nope, i didn't increase the mileage either.  so the problem is the shoes.  i tend to underpronate but at a cursing speed stride becomes more of a mid foot and forefoot striker.  so it baffled me as to why i was all of a sudden having an issue with my knee.  well, i put my hands in the shoes and felt the soles.  omg,  they are all crushed between mid to forefoot area.  i am effectively running on about half the cushion of the brand new shoes and this thing is not even 1 month old!  wth?  this shoe is junk!  if you are serious about running,  look for another brand.  i am utterly disappointed, and i don't think i will be trying another pair from saucony again anytime soon.  now this less than 1mo old shoe becomes less than a running shoes.  yes, disappointed.
151780	they are a bit big, across the top, but the length fits nicely. and they are so fun, pretty and oh so sexy!!
151799	"the size 11 flats i purchased fit ok, although they do seem to run a bit small (or seem to due to the pointed toe).  i was surprised when i received, them, though.  yes, the external heel is only .25"" but it has a stacked heel hidden in the shoe which means the actual heel height is about an inch.  this detail is really difficult to tell from the photos."
151939	this sandal has a really nice fit. the color is very versatile. true to size and comfortable enough to wear all day the first time. reason for the one star less is a squeaking sound coming from the sole of just one shoe. it would have been perfect otherwise.
151976	the elastic at the back forces your foot forward, causing your toes to rub painfully against the end of the shoe.  also - the smokey brown is really a dull gray.
151980	i usually wear an 8.5 , this shoe while comfortable slipped off my heel and was very loose in the front. i think an 8 may have fit in length but still would have been too sloppy on my foot.  the style was great and the for bed felt nice, but they had to go back.
152035	these are the perfect sports bras for light exercise. i walk and do yoga and the are just what i was looking for. the thin straps are perfect for wearing with cute tops. they are also nice for wearing around the house.
152091	i have a great deal of trouble with my feet, and the only relief i have found is with orthaheel.  this is my second pair, and i will continue to buy them.  i highly recommend these sandals.
152107	i've had them less than a week.  they are incredibly comfortable!!! however they are overpriced for man-made materials and the quality of construction. the real problem is the coating on the foot bed.  after tripping and scrapping the top edge on concrete, the coating is peeling off.  also, a friend accidentally stepped on the heel of my shoe while walking behind me and now the coating is peeling off there too.  the color underneath the faux wood coating is light tan and very noticeable. i'm going to try and touch it up with brown marker and hope that helps. despite the comfort, this is the first and last time i will be purchasing orthaheel unless i get them cheap on clearance. i'd rather spend $130 on birkenstocks or aetrex and know they'll hold up for years.
152128	purchased these shoes as casual walking shoes. they have decent arch support (though i do have high arches) and are well made. the shoes feel like they are slightly raised on the outer sides of my feet. they are comfortable for walking moderate distances but would definitely not wear they for any long treks.
152147	love this skirt i even golf in it super comfortable doesn't seem to wrinkle i'm 5'8 145 sister 10 fit great.
152215	as soon as i pulled this hat out of the box i saw that it looked cool and that it was made with high quality materials and sewn well. couldn't wait to go on vacation to wear it, because at the time i felt that i would look weird wearing it around town in autumn.this sun hat finally saw use in sunny hawaii... daily.  wore it while lounging at the pool, wore it while walking to foodland and while carrying groceries back to the rental apt.  it sat on my head well- slightly snug but loose enough to not notice that it was there. and since i had a crew-cut at the time, i was able to feel the wind passing thru the mesh top to cool my scalp.next challenge- walking the trail up to diamond head crater. it was a windy day but i read the warnings head of time so i had the drawcord snugly against under my chin and the hat was never blown off my head during my 2 hour stay on up in the heights.finally at the beach, the hat did get wet but it also dried out pretty quick as i continued to wear it.final grade: a++pros: well made, light weight, mesh all around the top, drawstring, wide brim, and excellent stone color.cons: -none-
152216	i used to use outdoor research products for backwoods camping and hiking, mostly in winter finding it to be a great brand.  in particular, their gators were very useful in snowy conditions.  that was 20 years ago and now i am a lazy soccer/lacrosse parent, so i needed a hat to protect my graying head from sun exposure.  so far it has been fine for the few times used, offering a good amount of ventilation and sun protection.  embarrassing for the children, but isn't that what parents are for, beside a source of income and labor?  a bit more floppy than i expected, but otherwise appears to be up to outdoor research's old standards.  size is spot on for my enormous noggin, and the elastic adjuster works fine.  the semi-annoying strap can be removed or folded up, goober style.  minor quibble for not being us made. for the price i would expect it to be made here, but it is what it is.  since it is my review i will deduct a star for this.
152222	this a great looking hat of lightweight, high tech design. it looks very prominent and feminine and has a draw string to keep it in place on windy days. i use it for kayaking, and it serves both as a head, neck, ear and shoulder sun protector, and as a beacon - it is very visible on the water from miles away, making it a safe boating choice.the only &#34;funny&#34; thing about this hat is the color. depending whether you're out in natural light or indoors or whether it's cloudy or sunny, the hat can look anywhere from bloody red to pink to off pink. i was mad at first because i thought i bought a red hat, but the chameleon quality of its color is cute. anyway, if you think it's a red hat - it's not.
152231	this hat is pretty perfect.  pretty, covers your face and neck, and has a band to keep it on.  one problem as has been stated in other reviews is that it blows back very easily so if the wind is in your face, it is going to blow backwards unless you keep it tilted way down (and then it is hard to see). it is hot, so if you are in a hot climate, there is no breatheability and for that reason i have moved to the columbia with the vents.  it isn't as pretty, but there you go. it also runs a bit big.  i have a big head, but could have done with a medium instead of the large.  nice thing though is that you can pull it smaller. i would recommend it highly but wish they would make it just a little stiffer.
152278	"i bought these in dark brown at a local discount shoe store (and then discovered that they were available for less on amazon) and am very happy with them. i have read reviews saying that the fit is loose--well, yeah, these are boat shoes. they don't have the same snug fit as dress shoes. nor would you want them to, especially because your feet expand outside in the warm weather. but loose doesn't mean ""sloppy""--i'm not in any danger of my feet popping out. they run true to size.the dark brown looks much better in person than in the picture. quality leather, really nice brown color, and nice solid rubber sole. these look good enough for me to wear to the office when i dress in business casual.keep in mind that there will be a lace to tie, just like any other shoes with laces. most of the pictures show laces, but not the bow you have to tie.note: there are boat shoes with laces that don't have to be tied, but this is not one of them.bottom line: timberland makes quality products and these boat shoes are one of them."
152309	these go with any outfit, and are so cute.  they are also very well made; i wore them all summer long and they still look brand new.  highly recommended!
152317	i have a black pair. they are so light and comfortable. the leather is very soft and there is absolutely no scratchy or uncomfortable bits to them. i bought a size 37 and they are a perfect fit (i think i'm usually a size 7 as i like my shoes to have just a little bit of room). a little hard to get on at first as the back portion is rigid where the heel sits. but once your feet are in i think you can forget you have them on.i just wish they were a bit cheaper then i'd get the gold pair too!
152338	bought this for my sister seeing as shes gauging her ears now. she said it works wonders and fast too. puts it on every day and things look healed.
152381	great price, feel & fit!! stood up to being washed twice a week during my clinicals....didn't fade or look worn! would purchase again! pockets fit my note pads, pens, and other supplies well!
152385	"you get what you pay for and these are worth every penny.  i am 5'7"", 140 lbs and a c cup and the small fit me great. i now have 4 sets, the royal blue, eggplant, red and teal. i washed them both twice before wearing just to take the stiffness out of the fabric. i really like the royal blue, red and teal, the pants match many of the tops that i already have, but i love the eggplant.  i got so many compliments on how nice the color looked on me from both fellow staff members and from my patients that i went online to find more tops to match the pants!  well built sturdy material that will hold up to the rigors of my very active job. i highly recommend.update 7/6/13 - i have had the sets for several months, the royal blue and eggplant were my first buys so they are the oldest. they have stood up well to my job and to repeated washings. colors have not faded, seems have not pulled apart as i have seen on cheaper scrubs, material still very sturdy. i will continue to buy more of these sets as they are worth every penny."
152393	i love these shoes, they are very comfortable to workout in, im not much of a cardio person, but i feel these may not last long for runners. they seem more like gym shoes if that makes sense.
152501	this sneaker looks great and is sturdy. nice cushioning and ankle support. i have worn it so far about 20 times and still try to get used to it that it is a bit stiff. overall a good sneaker for a good price though. if you want a softer upper part, not the sneaker for you.
152523	i love this product. fit just right and it's easy to use, i would buy this product again, definitely worth the money
152540	i bought this item because i wanted to own a underwear that is sexy that is not a thong since thongs and g-strings can be so uncomfortable sometimes. plus wanted something different to wear to bed. garment is exactly how it looks in the photo. i bought this item in a small (keep in mind i am 5'7, 125lbs with a larger than average butt) and fit well. looks sexy with any bra you wear with it. on the plus side, it made my butt look perkier than usual. the only problem is that it gets stuck between your lady parts sometimes, but still more comfortable than a thong, so thinking of getting more in the other colors.
152549	very soft and comfortable. not tight in the crotch or waist. waistband is padded as well. will buy more down the road if needed.
152551	i have better underwear at home, but i also paid more for one pair of them than all of these.  i give them 5 stars because i think they are an excellent value for the money.  if you are in to loose fitting, boxer brief style then these will make you happy.  loose around the thigh, snug at the waist, reasonably soft fabric (but no so soft that they will rip any time soon).  good choice for your normal, day to day underwear.
152652	the fit is a little bigger than was expected; fits more like a large. the boxers are soft and comfortable.
152660	i was a wrestler in college, so i have large thighs.  i have to purchase boxers with a larger waist to get room in the thighs.  these fit the bill, the elastic in the waist works well and these don't end up around my ankles (the package says 38inch waist, mine is 34).  the fabric is shall we say, sheer?  you can just about see thru it, but, as hard as it is to find cotton boxers &#60; $5.00 each, these are a deal.
152661	i knew what to expect with this item and got exactly that. good quality boxers. love the colors and the durability of fruit of the loom.
152687	it is a gift!requested by one of my children for christmas!i am sure it will be appreciated!please i have no other comments
152722	went to vibram's website to determine proper sizing and these fit the bill. my 10 year old, with awkwardly large feet, was having trouble adapting her gait to her rapidly enlarging feet which was making her walk funny. these shoes fix that. she can't scrunch her toes up and they let her be more aware of the terrain she is walking over which all goes together to get her gait looking more natural again.
152723	i've always preferred barefoot running; before i got these shoes, i did it without any. that was okay for a mile or so, but then my feet would start hurting due to gravel, rough surfaces, etc. i was a little bit nervous about purchasing these without trying them on in a store first, but my anxiety was unwarranted. these fit great! i followed the sizing tips from the five-fingers website and it was a helpful reference. these shoes fit excellently even with a long middle toe, and i was able to go for a run immediately with no discomfort. i would definitely recommend these.
152745	i got this within 3 days and it's perfect, the only thing i didn't like was i had to sort out the sizes and hoped they all match up to what there suppose to be, but other then that the product is fine. it's just sad for me i can't stretch my ears past 2g....sad :,(
152800	these rings are awesome. they are a solid piece of basically indestructible tungsten carbide, so do not worry at all about scratches, stains or nicks in the metal. i am a very active individual and not even once did i damage the ring (i used it even for gym/weight lifting and it withstood encounters with solid barbells and weight plates). the ring shines pretty good and looks very sophisticated. the neutral steel color matches well with basically anything.the only warning i should mention is that these rings tend to have a rough or sharp edge in the elevated design of the ring. this little edge can literally scratch anything (even your face when washing it) so be careful! i got my fair share or minor skin scratches and several panels of my car and the leather of my steering wheel have been scratched. i say &#34;tend to have&#34; the sharp edge because i have owned three of them (one got lost and the other one got too loose due to weight loss on my end) and only one had a really sharp edge, the other ones were manageable.if you get the right size and one with a good and harmless edge, you will have durable, forever solid ring.
152832	so i did a bit of research after the ring was purchased on here.the binding substance makes or breaks the ring when you're talking about tungsten carbide. if it's mixed with some substances it was tarnish, break down, lose its luster, and leave marks on the skin. this ring's filler (nickel) is the best that you can buy. because of this, my ring should never lose its luster, or break down in any way-shape-or-form.i have friends at work (i work in healthcare) that use sanitizer like it's going out of style. they bought their rings from the jewelers and their rings cost $300. their tc rings have lost their luster, are marred to heck, and are essentially ruined. i told them that if they wanted a cheaper alternative when/if they replace theirs, that they should look on here. thank god we didn't spend $300 for ours to have top of the line!
152861	i'm new to crocs and recently bought the huarache flats style, which i absolutely love.  i also wanted a closed toe style and assumed that these would have the same footbed as my super-comfy crocs huaraches.  but i'm very disappointed in these.  instead of soft and cushy like i was expecting, these seem very hard, uncomfortable, and so thin that i can feel the hard ground with every step.  would have immediately returned but i was so confident i'd love them that i cut the tags off before even trying them on.  big mistake!  i'll only be using them for gardening shoes.
152948	here is beauty in simplicity! this understated surf bracelet is adjustable and durable. it looks nice alone or when paired with another rope-style bracelet.  it took a little time to arrive, because the company is based in the uk. however, it was definitely worth the wait.
152977	"i first switched from nike to mizuno running shoes 3 or 4 years ago after being evaluated on a treadmill at a local running store.  i always assumed that i had a fairly significant pronation issue since my running shoes had such uneven wear patterns.  but, instead, they felt that i just needed a moderate neutral shoe for regular daily use and recommended mizuno.  i've been wearing the mizuno wave riders ever since (through all the different year models).  i've also used their wave precision, a slightly lighter-weight, neutral performance shoe; but i prefer the wave rider for regular use.i love the fact that they're lightweight and yet they offer plenty of stability, cushioning, and ""bounce.""  i've had knee problems for several years and one of my knees is post-surgery.  finding a shoe that doesn't mess with my knee is very important to me.  i occasionally try out other shoes, but always end up coming back to this one.  the synthetic and mesh fabric allows them to dry out quickly if i've been slogging through puddles on rainy days.  the mesh makes them quite breathable and the toe box of the shoe seems to offer more wiggle space than many other running shoes i've tried.i find the mizuno wave riders to be true to size.  the ""bleached aqua/sun orange/dark shadow"" color is very nice."
152992	"started running seriously about a year ago. have tried a wide variety of shoes, which my other varied shoe reviews will attest to. although i started in more cushioned fare, i quickly went to more minimal shoes looking to gain some speed. at an athletic 6'3"" 205lbs i realize i can't keep up with lighter seasoned runners, but do like trying to see where i can get while staying above 200lbs. sub 22 for 5k so far and hoping to improve that this summer.although lighter shoes did help me and i really like low drop shoes, at higher speeds and greater training miles, i feel the pounding. these mizunos aren't built for speed and in this day and age are very heavy in my size 12's. they are however great at reducing shock for larger runners such a myself. i am not a heavy heel striker but catch enough to make use of the wave plate as it is set up in this shoe. heel to mid foot area is to me very plush and exactly what i was looking for. the forefoot is a little firmer but still nice. shoe fit true to size and is very well built. out of the box it was a little stiff but really loosens up in about 10 miles and is very nice at that point.i picked it up at half off here on amazon and think it is a nice shoe for that price. i have read other reviews that state lighter runners may not get a lot from this shoe but for me at 205, it was what i was looking for. i would also give it 10-15 miles before you make a judgement as i is initially very stiff but once broken in is a much better shoe. this won't be what i wear for speed work races but being able to cut down on the pounding a few times a week by replacing my lighter shoes with these on about half my runs has help my legs recover more quickly and allowed me to run more. blue and yellow color looks great as does the open heel look which also really works well to mitigate shock."
152994	very compy. my first mizuno. but, the width is narrower than other brands (i usually wear d(m)) which's really annoying.therefore (and not only), i think mizuno should also offer a 2e version. i will enjoy this shoe but won't go for the 14th model, if won't be any changes concerning this issue (wider default d or ee option).in terms of quality and comfort, it's superb- more than everything else i tried. i use orthodics so my experience is a bit upgraded (but most serious runners do).
153053	"i usually like tote purses. but i decided to try something different. i ordered this purse when it was marked down to $4.97 and i couldn't pass it up. i love this little purse. my kindle fire fit in this bag perfectly. i will need a smaller wallet tho .. if i want to carry my kindle in it also on the regular bases. both of them in there together makes the bag look over stuffed. but that doesn't stop me from giving this bag 5 stars. i adjusted the straps so that the purse sits right below my hip. which is the furthest is will go. perfect. i am about 5'5.i smelled the purse when i got it due to the reviews saying the bag had a ""rubbery"" smell. the purse smells like a brand new purse to me.no complaints on this end."
153091	it has hard foot nubs, unlike my patricia ii's, which are soft. i found the hard foot nubs uncomfortable. it didn't have enough arch support. the foot bed was too hard. the straps occasionally allowed the shoe to slide off too easily. the top strap hurt my foot a little. i have narrow feet with high arches.
153124	my mom recently had foot surgery and has to be sure that she wears well padded shoes.  she still wants to look fashionable though.  we hunted through the mall for several hours to no avail and finally wandered into the croc's store where she tried these on.  because they were cheaper online i ordered them from amazon.  it wasn't 3 days after she had received them that she called me and asked me to order another pair in a different color.  if you knew my mom you would know what a huge compliment to crocs that is.  these look good enough to wear with a dress and are casual enough to wear with jeans.  and no matter what she has on these are supportive and comfortable
153146	i saw these in a crocs store and fell in love.  i was able to try them on so i could be sure what size to order on amazon. they are so cute and the cocoa color is beautiful. i wear between an 8 and 8 1/2 and the 8 fit perfect.  i adjusted the strap to the tightest setting and have no issues with them slipping off my heel.  i have a medium width foot and have no issue with them cutting across my toes in a bad way.  they are super comfy and i love them.
153221	these were even prettier in person than in the picture.  comfy, sexy and cute.  i got my daughter a medium but she could have worn a small.  but then, pj's are supposed to be a little lose for comfort.
153338	i am a clark's fan. i have three pairs of these sandals. they are comfortable, well-made and stylish.  the price was excellent. a great purchase!
153349	i loved the way that these sandals look and usually clark's shoes are very comfortable. they came out with a new design this year that really didn't work for me. i normally wear a 7 but because of the molded footbed, these didn't fit so i tried the next size up and they were still awkward. i was very disappointed  because i usually purchase a new pair of clark's sandals each summer. their new footbed design did not work for me at all.
153385	i have the pewter color in this style. this is the most comfortable, easy to wear sandal i've ever owned. i've always liked having a back strap, but these are so easy to keep on my feet without that strap and my feet never tire. they don't feel clunky because the design is quite svelte along the outside of your foot.these sandals look nice enough to dress up a little. the pewter color looks fantastic with black outfits and unlike black sandals, the pewter doesn't make my pale white feet look like they belong to a vampire. no, these are quite flattering. princess feet for me!i walked the entire length of central park in these and could easily have kept going. i've worn these to disney world. i've worked all day on my feet in these. i forget i'm wearing them. i hate taking them off at the end of the day and i love slipping them on in the morning. i hope winter never comes.
153401	this zip up sweatshirt fits good, keeps me warm, and is a very good price. the two color detail makes it a little different in looks from other sweatshirts.  i'm glad i bought it.
153431	it's a little big on him, in my opinion, but he wanted it bigger. my son is 5ft 9in and about 190lbs, if that helps with sizing for you. he said it's super soft and i've even caught him sleeping in the thing! he loves it.
153568	i bought these pants in black and when they arrived they were actually the granite heather color.  the tags were still attached and they said black, so i'm not sure if the error occurred with the manufacturer or the seller.  i liked the granite heather color so i decided to keep them.
153579	my only complaint is that it pills.  aside from that, they are warm and fit well.  i appreciate the length (i am 5'6&#34;0.
153622	"i love these pants. the color is very pretty, they are long enough i'm 5'8"" 140# and got a large. they have held up great through repeated washings.the only con is i wish they had pockets but it's not a big deal"
153760	based on the size i bought a large but it's too big. i think a medium would have fit better.my waist is like 35 hip 43. so if your similar size you might want a size down. the crotch was big and waaay too long.
153806	the jacket is very thin and the wrists of the sleeves are a little scratchy. it definitely isn't a form fitting jacket. however, it's casual and fashionable enough to wear in public.
153888	especially those reviews that said it's a little stiff... because it is. it's a very blah sort of shirt. if i was running out to the supermarket i *might* put this one on but more likely this will be relegated to the back of my closet for when i run out of clean shirts. and even then it probably won't leave the house. the one i bought was black - and it was definitely a dull black. the light colors *might* be okay in terms of color but the black definitely isn't nice. or soft. the one in the picture was definitely taken at the shirt's best possible angle...
153973	i'm 5'10&#34;, 34inch waist, 180 lbs., with a 30 inch inseam.  i bought both the large and medium sizes in the light grey for comparison. both fit very well with the medium being more snug, but not uncomfortably so. some people would find the medium more supportive. the large i like for lounging around and sleeping. the reason i bought both sizes to compare was for the length. i measured both inseams with a tape measure. the medium has a 31 inch inseam. the large measures 33 inch inseam. the medium length fit perfectly on the top of my shoe without my ankle exposed.  the large length pooled a bit at my ankle, but is not a problem even when walking along distances. any longer and i think the fabric rubbing together would be annoying. i like the open bottom very much. the pants are easy to slip on and off.  the fabric is a good medium weight for both indoor and outdoor wear. i wouldn't wear them in really wet and cold weather without a wind and water-resistant layer on top. good quality all around.
153978	the legs were way too long, and i had to pay to get them hemmed, but then maybe i didn't look closely enough to the length.
154021	the first time my husband put on these sweat pants, he didn't want to take them off.  my spouse claims they were so warm and comfy, he was tempted to wear them to bed.  i was hesitant to buy clothes made out of recyclable articles, because my past experience with them have not been good.  these particular ones seem to be holding up much better after several times of laundering.
154048	really excellent quality and feel....very warm...very soft....and looks great... i plan to buy more of these as they are a must have
154154	this was by far the best online jewelry purchase i've ever made. perfect length but the piece may be a little heavy for some but not enough to make me rate it less than 5 stars.
154161	i have one foot that is swollen just on the top of it and the ortho surgeon foot specialist can't find the cause.  i can't wear my regular size 8 shoes.  i was planning to fly out of the country so i needed something to wear on my feet besides slippers.  this looked like it would work so i bought an 8w and thought that if it was too big i could wear thicker socks.  the problem is that the back of the heel rises too high.  the edge rubs against the back of my leg/top of heel and it hurts just when trying them on.  i know it will cause a blister in no time, so i am returning them.  other than this issue, the shoes were very cushiony - almost too much.  the elastic strap was a non issue for me since the shoe was so big.
154185	"really pleased and very happy with my choice.  the sandals fit perfectly and the style enhances my feet and i have noticed other women looking at my feet.  now,  the walking is another issue.  the footbed is soft yet so supportive.  my feet are most happy.  having a previous torn leg/knee and getting over that for months and having to wear running shoes everyday makes this first sandal choice a ""big issue"" for me.  it went perfectly!  you can bet more naturalizer shoes are in my future."
154187	i was skeptical about buying this sandals because naturalizer brand shoes tend to be narrow, even if you buy a wide width one.  but this one is just perfect!  it is super comfortable and great for my bunion!  i've had compliments on this sandals too!  planning to buy another color soon!
154203	have to return these as they are shockingly small. these are not the standard kidorable/kamik wider bridge last (foot mold) that they usually use. these i think were inspired by hunters but lack the wider footbed while being inspired by the elevated design. our children have worn the kamiks with the dinos on them in size 11 but these run like a 10/9.5 in that design. wide feet and tall toddlers should size up at least one. our son wear a us12 but would have needed two sizes bigger in these.
154246	i had been look all over for low rise underwear and found this one.  and it fits me just right.
154248	not only do the individual briefs in the pack differ from each other in size, but the individual briefs are not tailored properly. for example, on one of the briefs the waist band is wider on the right side than on the left; on another one the leg hole larger than the other.  don't buy.
154296	i never thought i'd find myself writing a review for underwear, but this product changed my mind.  i am an avid hiker, backpacker, kayaker and all around outdoor enthusiast.  i have all the fancy base layers, wool socks, and quick dry clothing you would expect, yet was still wearing regular old cotton underwear when backpacking. after the my last trip i finally decided there had to be something better.  i was planning on wearing my compression shorts when i stumbled upon these and decided to give them a try.they fit great, are snug without the squeeze, don't ride up, won't stretch out and the articulated crotch adds a layer of comfort that was completely unexpected yet totally welcome.  while they are too expensive for everyday wear, i would certainly recommend them during strenuous and prolonged activities such as hiking and backpacking.
154459	this is now my 4th pair of these ugly shoes and i don't even care because they are so comfortable! perfect waterproof shoe for summer, perfect walking shoe on hot humid days, perfect shoe for when you are going to be on your feet. ugly but perfect! like walking on tiny pillows that cradle your feet
154505	my feet felt like they were sliding around inside due to the smooth, sleek material. it was disconcerting & didnt seem stable or safe.
154540	just love this shoe very comfortable and a wide fit just what i need, i have it in 3 different clolours
154725	i got this dress yesterday and up until the moment i put it on, i was convinced i should have ordered the medium and not the small, but the small fit perfectly. (i currently wear between a us10 & us12 size in women's clothing for reference) i can't imagine how the medium would have been. i'm guessing i would have been swimming in it! anyways, i hope that helps anyone else looking at it and wondering about the sizing. order down at least one size!dress cut is very cute and flattering. the pocket zipper is a little bit ripply down the side seam, but nothing too distracting. i also like that it is cut on the top in such a way that you could layer another close fit shirt under it without any problems. i plan to wear this on a trip to a fairly conservative (and hot) country, so i will probably take a long sleeve cooling undershirt to wear under it for modesty's sake. in the same vein, i like that the neckline is low enough to feel pretty and feminine, but if i lean over, no one is getting a view. :p the fabric is light enough that i don't think it will feel too hot or suffocating, but still heavy enough to feel like proper clothes.it also does, indeed, feel soft exactly like pajamas! need i say more?i would definitely buy again.
154729	i love this dress but since i took my tag off the black one i bought, i thought i took a large.  wrong!  in this brand i take a medium...i am 5&#34; 6' and over 155 pounds, but very athletic so it is hard to tell with sizing.  i was too lazy to send it back and just bought another in a medium...someone will score at a used clothing store.
154778	loved the look of these sandals but the leather is so hard that i'm still trying to break them in.  they are very uncomfortable to wear for more than 30 minutes at a time.  i have blisters everywhere.
154779	one word. attractive. ok maybe a few others, sexy, bold, classy and a must have. this goes well when you dont want to over dress
154781	it got 2 starts because the skirt seems like a great concept for traveling, especially to hot humid climates. the material was very soft and not heavy. it hung nicely. ok, now for the negatives. the sizing is way off. i usually wear a 4/6 got the xs based on previous reviews and it was falling off me. i am 136lbs. 5'9&#34;. it came way past my knees and im tall. it hit at a weird length. you cant roll the waist and there is just no hope in making it work. if you are my size or smaller, sorry you will have to pass on this. nice concept but terribly fit.
154784	i purchased this skirt in black and it has become a staple piece of clothing in my travelling wardrobe.  it is very comfortable to wear on the plane or on long car journeys as it doesn't crease and is of a modest length.its versatility will save you packing space because with a change of top and the addition of a pair of strappy sandals, it can be transformed into an outfit suitable for wear to a nice restaurant.there is nothing that i can find wrong with this skirt.
154803	the shirt hangs very well and looks the part. it does feel rough, so you'd really need to wear a white undershirt to be comfortable if 2-stepping, etc...when you first get it and wash it, be sure to wash it with like colors (only reds!) i made the mistake of throwing in a few white t-shirts and towels, which turned pink. damn.overall, for the price, it's solid and looks the part. yee haw.
154813	this is a really nice western style shirt. this gives you a good looking, comfortable and reasonably priced western shirt without too much flair. this shirt can be worn as a dress shirt and with a regular tie or as a western shirt with a bolo tie and cowboy boots with jeans. highly recommend.
154821	i had to buy a 1/2 size larger because my choices were an 8 or 9 and i wear an 8 1/2.  so they are loose; i tried thick socks,double socks, no insert, double inserts, thick gel inserts - and i still have blisters on my heels. then i discovered the decorativeleather (?) strip around the top is sown through the middle of the strip and the lower half, beneath the stitch was catching on myheel - hence the blisters.  i am now considering putting some strong tape - i. e. electrical tape to hold it down.  - at the momenti don't have usable rain shoes, and it's not raining.
154827	very nice chain for the price.  chain has a nice diamond cut with a pretty sparkle.  another excellent feature is that the chain ishypoallergenic which is great because i am allergic to cheap metal chains.  i would recommend this to anyone who is allergic to metal.  so far i have not had any problems with being allergic to the chain.  i am planning on ordering another one in a longer length.  i purchased the 20&#34; one.  also has a nice lobster claw.  one of the best chains i have purchased on-line.caroline
154834	kudos to amazon, your chain is so substantial that i thought you sent me a much more expensive chain, but it is exactly what i ordered.
154839	beautiful necklace! it is very well made, which is what i expected for italian silver. the lobster-claw clasp adds the perfect finishing touch. substantial gram weight is used on each of these items (i bought one in every length). i love the 16 inch length and truly appreciate finding it as this length is not readily available from most sellers/vendors. these will look great layered together or worn in a variety of length combinations or worn solo. it will also add interest to a substantial pendant. great find! my order was handled, processed,  shipped, and delivered in record time. very pleased.
154848	chain was sturdy and stylish. i ordered another. i ordered a larger one. the 18 in was a bit small
154862	"i received my rings today, and i am very satisfied.  i am replacing my wedding ring, which is 14kt gold, and after 22 years has decided to cause some sort of allergic reaction on my finger.  i took some time to look over the different cz sets because i didn't want my set to look ""cloudy"" or fake like most can do, even though there is no way we would be able to afford a diamond of this size.  the center stone is quite large, as it should be at 3 carat.  one of the reasons i chose this cut is because i think a diamond cut this way doesn't have quite as much deep luster as a diamond cut a different way.  easier to pass as a diamond, another words.  all of the stones have a really nice amount of sparkle and shine.  the light catches them beautifully; radiant cut is an excellent description of the stone.  it is super hard to tell from the seller's ""catalog"" view of the item how nice the stones look, but i was pleasantly surprised.  for the amount i paid, i am very pleased, and i would absolutely recommend this set to someone else."
154864	this ring is very pretty and is quite beautiful to wear. i've gotten so many compliments on this ring and recommend this as a good investment.
154874	"i bought this watch 2 years ago from rei on sale. so far the watch has held up well to the abuse of winter,rain,heat and me! does everything i want it to do(yes you do need to remove it from your wrist and let it sit to get a ""true"" temp reading but.....you have to do it with any watch that has this option)the watch face is large and if you have a smaller wrist you might not like the fit. it feels solid(a little heavy?)and the band is great(much nicer than the one on my casio pathfinder)and gotta love the analog face...looks great at a great price! just wish it was solar powered......"
154900	dansko's are always awesome and these are no different. they just look even cuter with all of the colors! they do fit a bit big so a half size down is recommended. i just love dansko's for their fit and comfort. nothing else compares. every doctor and nurse i know wear them because of the comfort when standing for long periods of time. if you have a job that keeps you on your feet, these are the shoes for you. any of the dansko shoes work for that!
154968	they arrived timely. they were exactly as described on line. they fit perfectly. if you have problems with your feet yet want to wear heals these work, they give me arch support and comfort and are stylish.
154984	excellent quality, fits beautfully and it is elegant. bought two! for heavens sake why do you have to have more words. what more can i say?!
155031	i ordered several clarks to try out with the expectation that i would send back all but one or two pairs but i wanted to keep them all!  most of all, i knew i had to keep these sandals.  they are just heavenly to walk in!  originally i ordered them in black because that was available with prime but the black is suede and just looks too harsh.  i returned and ordered in pewter as it came available via prime.  i adore them!  they look nice and they feel great.  i have plantar fasciitis and so i've been replacing all my shoes with ones that have better support.  these fit the bill!  the one thing i will say, if you it is a hot day and you sweaty feet you may experience some sliding around with these.
155037	the padding of these sandals is incredible , it's perfect for walking, but in my case, just the left sandal is perfect , the right one is a little tight- i measured it - ,it lacks +/-1/4&#34; .so i had to fix it. that's my only complaint. definitely the &#34;in motion&#34; models have the most comfortable padding. i would recommend these sandals.
155073	love em but have to send them back unfortunately.  next size up will be too big.  really cute shoes for summer.
155100	i liked it but not enough to pay the full price. i would have preferred the heel to be a little higher to make it less &#34;chunky&#34;. it's also about a 1/2 size too short. the biggest problem i had though was that the fabric of foot-bed seemed to be of the kind to make your feet sweat - really not good for a sandal.
155189	i loved the shoe, but since i have a wide foot i could not wear this shoe comfortably. dansko shoes were recommended by my doctor, but they need wide choices for me to buy them.
155211	i bought them in brown, red and green.  returned all three. the red and the green lack color depth.  i loved these shoes, until i tried them on.  my feet are fairly wide and they fit, felt very comfortable, but i did not care for the wide strap on top.  they are high on looks with the cute heel cutout, but the resin bottom is heavy and lacks flexibility with no shock absorption.  clunky walk.
155214	i rarely ever wear pumps, but i do wear these with many of my casual outfits to dress them up a bit. my foot measures 9.25&#34;. i usually wear a 6 in flats and a 6.5 in heels. got these in nude and red. pretty comfy for wearing 6 hours or so. maybe longer when broken in.
155230	received item damaged. packaging seemed ok, but appeared that some one or something crushed the watch. returned it and did not reorder.
155236	"this is my third invicta watch. i bought two invictas from amazon in 2008, aninvicta men's 9816 lupah collection chronograph watch(i bought black and red bands for it and have never worn it with the yellow band), and about six months later aninvicta men's 5249w pro diver stainless steel white dial watch. i've had no problems with either watch. each keeps accurate time and draws many compliments. (i paid $61.16 for the lupah and $49.99 for the pro diver.)i think it's unfortunate that invicta chooses to market their watches with grossly inflated list prices (unfortunate because it's an insult to consumers' intelligence). the retail markup on watches is typically 40 to 50 percent above wholesale (the price the retailer pays). you can get a sense of invicta watch wholesale values at the global trade sites [...]. no one who buys the model under review is getting a six hundred and ninety five dollar watch with a wholesale value in the three hundred and fifty dollar ballpark. that said, based on my experience with invictas, i think they are well worth the actual retail prices at which they typically sell. (visit [...] and enter the asin for any item listed at amazon to get the price history.)invicta watches come in attractive yellow boxes with leather-like outer surfaces and felt-like linings inside. each of the 3 invictas i've received have come running, meaning that the battery is worn down to some degree. (the lupah battery died on me after a year; the pro diver battery is still powering the watch, and it is now nearly 3 years to the month since i bought it. the 1245 came set to within a minute of the correct time, but a day off on the calendar.) instructions are of course included, but if you want to know how to operate a chronograph, you can do no better than to watch synthspike's youtube 2  minute long video titled, ""what is a chronograph? a watch with a stopwatch timer."" chronograph watches, not to be confused with watches called chronometers, are basically watches with stopwatch functions.the 1245 comes with the band adjusted for the largest wrist. my wrists are large, but even after adjusting the band down to the smallest opening (a simple matter of moving pins without actually removing a link), the 1245 is a tad too loose on my wrist, and i may end up having a link removed (an adjustment i prefer not to attempt myself; see my last comment after asterisks below).the invicta watch company was founded in switzerland in 1837, and the brand name was bought in 1991 by a us-based investment company which uses the name invicta watch group, headquarted in florida. other than in name, the invicta watch group is a distinct entity from the original invicta watch company. most invicta watches manufactured today are believed to be manufactured by subcontractors in china (look for the wiki article chinese watch industry wiki - invicta for more information). none of this is a problem for me, and should not be a problem for anyone who does not unrealistically imagine that they can get a seven hundred dollar watch manufactured in switzerland for under a hundred, for invictas are reliable, good quality watches for watches in their actual versus inflated price range. (the 1245 comes with a sticker on a branded rubbery yellow tag attached to the watchband by yellow string that says, ""msrp $695.00."")the invicta chronograph under review has a 43mm case diameter, which means that it is a very large watch. if you are considering buying this model for someone as a gift, consider how a watch this large might look on them, what it might say about them, and if it really suits their personality and style. in his article, ""what you wear on your wrist matters, so do it properly - or don't"" at just keep the change dot com, fred stepanov says that watches are statements, and that a man's watch can tell people if a guy is a sportsman, a rough guy, a businessman, or a connoisseur. while i wouldn't limit the invicta 1245 to being a rough guy watch, i do think this line by stepanov fits: ""men need something rough and dependable, something that can tell the time and occasionally help with hammering down a nail.""for the right guy, the invicta 1245 chronograph in its attractive yellow box should make for an impressive gift.***if you do give someone an invicta watch as a gift, here's something you may want to consider: my first two invictas came with a no-extra cost extended warranty plan that required little more than mailing a postcard. the 1245 comes with a standard 1 year warranty, and enclosed in the box is an application to extend that by 4 years for a total of 5. but it's not free and the cost of the extended ""platinum plan"" warranty depends on the ""suggested retail price"" of the watch. in fine print we are told that ""plan costs are based on the official suggested retail value of the watch as marked."" as i mention above, the 1245 comes with a tag attached to it with a msrp or manufacturer's suggested retail price of $695.00. the cost of extending the warranty for watches with a ""suggested retail price"" of $500.00 and up is $65.00. in addition, watch owners are responsible for the cost of shipping their watch to invicta for repair and ""any shipping back to the owner will be charged at a flat rate of $20.00."" someone who receives a 1245 as a gift who pays to extend his warranty from 1 year to 5 is going to end up paying close to what the watch cost the gift giver for this privilege. if you give this or any other invicta as a gift that has the aforementioned warranty application in the box, you might want to warn the gift recipient, and possibly even let him or her know that he may be able to replace the watch for what it would cost to extend the warranty and cover shipping to and from invicta's repair facility.***once the case has been opened by anyone but invicta, e.g., to replace the battery, the invicta warranty is void. given that it's unlikely that the battery will die within the 1 year warranty period, having a battery replaced by invicta will require paying $65.00 to extend the warranty + the cost of shipping the watch to invicta in florida + invicta's $20.00 flat rate return postage charge. both my local walmart and a local jeweler replace watch batteries for the cost of the battery (around $5 at the former, $7 at the latter), though a jeweler may be a safer bet given that some watches (such as the aforementioned invicta lupah) seem to have battery enclosures designed by rube goldberg.***i got two links removed from my 1245 at my local walmart, where i was not charged for this service and have never been charged for it at walmart in the past."
155274	i never used it and sent it back as it was not what i thought it was. so the rating means nothing. did not use. 20 words.
155276	i am a lady and my normal wallet is those big 4x7 ones that will only fit in your purse and not your pants pocket. but sometimes i just want to pull out my id and my major credit cards and some money. this does the trick. i have my id, 6 cc's and some bills folded in 2x (half, then half again). they fit and fit in my back pants. the leather is pretty good and thick so it looks like it will last.i initially  bought the con air passport trifold one but that was way too big but i'm still keeping it and saving it for travel as it does fit our passports and travel docs.this one will serve as my daily one now placed inside my 4x7 wallet and will just pull this out when i don't want to bring my big wallet purse.
155351	you're just too good to be true. cant take my eyes off of you. youd be like heaven to touch. i want to hold you so much. youre just too good to be true. cant take my eeyyees off of you.
155401	its a lovely bag. very exquisite and stylish. i would recommend it for a nice gift. quite  nice i would buy another one in black
155434	i have several pairs of franco sarto shoes and love them all.  i wear them to work even though i am on my feet for a couple of hours at a time. they always look great, wear well, and feel comfortable.  i love them!
155477	i purchased this hat for work because i work in a bakery and wanted something comfortable as well as visually appealing. i love this hat. it's not too heavy, not too thin, fits great, (i am a 7 1/4 hat size, got the 7 and it's perfect) -- and all my coworkers thought it was the &#34;cutest&#34; hat.i would buy it again.
155539	i had been looking for some good peacock feather earrings for a while but didn't want to pay too much, this was a great deal and i am happy with my earrings.  you get what you pay for so these do not seem all that durable to me but that's ok because i still love wearing them and get compliments on them all the time!
155605	these pants feel great, look great but they don't hold up over time. the actual fabric is a lightweight material (but it is 100% opaque) which is great, because i can't stand flying in heavy, hot clothes with some of the airlines holding out longer to turn on the in-cabin a/c.  these are sharp looking pants, and i like the fact they fit me in the seat and don't droop.review update 12/2013: i took off two stars for the fact these pants have not held up to washing on the gentle/delicate cycle. the seams and stitching are fine, however the inside lining around the waist has gotten soft and pliable, where it causes problems with the overall fit and hold of the waistline. i bought seven pairs and wear them m-f so i would expect at least 6 months before i saw any wear issues.sizing suggestion -- i needed to add two sizes up for a perfect fit around the waist.
155634	i got this bracelet for my husband, and he really likes it. the past few i have purchased broke very quickly. i decided to get something other than tungsten. he was impressed with how solid and heavy this piece is, as well as the simple, yet elegant design. very satisfied with this bracelet, and the price of the piece compared to the value couldn't have been better!!!
155722	my daughter was taking a few shaky steps in her sketcher skidders when i decided it was time to spring for her first big girl walking shoes. seeing as she's my youngest of 4 kids under 4, i wanted to make sure that i would buy something that would be cute, durable & supportive as she was learning to walk. she immediately started walking all over since she put these on. she no longer is a crawler, but is now a little walker. these definitely live up to the stride rite name. i'm very happy with this purchase.
155727	these are really pretty and sparkly - if the center stones had been smaller they might have even passed for real at first glance. i do find them a bit big and heavy for everyday wear and the clasp closing is not the most secure but for the price, these are a nice accessory to have on hand for those occasions when you want something eye-catching without having to bust out the really expensive stuff. i often carry them with me when i travel to weddings or other formal/semi-formal events.
155740	bought these disposable shoe covers for less than $7. they fit well for women, but they maybe a little bit small for men. my family uses them for whenever we go visit the cemetery a couple times a year and my sister really hates it when we track dirt into her car or eventually back into the house, especially during the cold/rainy seasons. my family don't mind the grass and dirt and various critters, but i'm not a grass and dirt  person, so this helps keep our shoes clean.
155742	the quality is not quite what i hoped for, but the price was right. i have wood floors and it's easier for guests to use these than to remove their shoes when visiting for short periods of time.
155758	my husband is impossible to shoe shop for, and these did the trick. i ordered ten pairs from z*ppos and these were the winners. when he lost one shoe (how?), z didn't carry them anymore - so happy amazon did. second pair is great too, and they are holding up really well. should last quite a while if we can keep both of them around. great double duty shoes for casual weekend wear and for hiking rough hilly terrain.
155759	these shoes are exceptionally comortable for my feet.  my feet are just a little smaller than size 13, and this shoe in size 13 fits just right.  they appear to be well-made.  they are rigid enough for moderate hiking.  the vibram soles grip rocks very well.  for long hikes, they of course will not support as well a good pair of boots, but for their intended purpose, they exceed my expecations.  i did not like the thin laces, so i replaced them with the laces that i use for boots.
155784	i have a pair of these in multi colour and it is adorable and fits extremely well and super duper cute. sadly, i can't say the same for the white colour. i expect it to fit right (not used it yet because i ordered a size up) but it looks monstrous and clumsy and like a white brick. i regret this purchase. the bottom (rubbery sole) appears slightly yellow compared to the upper leather part. just not what i expected. i had high hopes for this because i'm so happy with the purchase of the identical sandals in multi color. i give it 3 stars because i expect it to be as comfortable as the multi color pair she is now wearing. if aesthetics is a concern for you then choose another pair of white sandals.
155802	i love these shoes! they are pretty comfortable and fit true to size. because of their neutral color they go with almost anything. they are pretty hot. i would definitely recommend these.
155804	these heels are really pretty in person and they fit me well because they were not loose around the heels like some heels i've tried. look forward to wearing these.
155903	i walk three miles in these shoes every day, so i need quality, comfort, style, and durability.  quality is top notch, you can just tell.  comfort is good - take some breaking in as all quality shoes do.  style is nice, although i have them in the tan color as well and those are really sharp.  not much shine on these but that doesn't bother me much.  durability - you can tell they will last by the construction.  this is not some kenneth cole or steve madden piece of garbage that looks nice and falls apart.  recommended.
155941	i got these shoes for work because i'm standing all day and i've had crocs in the past that were amazing, but these ones were not. i wore them to work for a day and found that they were actually less comfortable than my regular sneakers i had been wearing previously so i'm going to return them. nowhere near as comfortable as all the other crocs i've had before this. the sole is just not that soft crocs sole you're expecting. also they are so ugly i felt like i was wearing orthopedic shoes.
155957	"i am very happy with this necklace. very reasonably priced, but looks elegant when wearing it. i have been searching for the perfect ""double""necklace and i finally found it!!"
155960	this coat is well made, warm and a great color! we are very pleased with this product. london fog is a trusted label and amazon made it so easy to order. arrived on time.
156035	these shoes are exactly what they claim.  barefoot...really just vented protection that feels like you're running without shoes.  if you require more cushioning and/or arch support, you should probably look elsewhere.  i bought them for a mud run next month since they're made of rubber.  i have run in them and liked how they feel, plus the holes are great for ventilation.  i wear nice running socks with them for a little extra cushioning.
156066	not the best crucifix. apparently made in china,the problem with it is that the head protrudes to far off the cross. should you be wearing it under say a t shirt it produces an odd looking bulge can be seen.
156149	i just received this necklace for my birthday.  i absolutely love it.  the colors of the pearls are so lovely and the length is perfect, too.  these will work perfectly with a dressy or casual outfit and i'm sure i will have many occasions to wear them.  i couldn't be more pleased.  :)
156169	it does keep your feet warm but my toes & the sides of my feet still hurts. thankfully, i bought this genius gadget for feet which i call toe covers and they do wonders on my feet!
156224	this is a lovely little gold necklace. the pendant is about the size of a dime, and the laser cutting of the initial is a beautiful contrast to the high polished gold surrounding it. the chain is very fine, but i like the look of the fine chain taking a back seat so all you really see is the pendant. plus, you can always change the chain if you want. this will be my signature piece of jewelry.
156259	i bought these sandles for my grandson. he says they are really comfortable andthat was my main concern because he walks quite a bit. i would recomend these.
156271	timberland is just a great shoe, and these sandals are definitely part of the timberland family.  they fit well, daughter says they are comfortable, and they made it through the washing machine -much needed after a long weekend camping left these sandals anything but white!  definitely recommend!
156402	what i've learned from buying three different pairs of wallflowers is... the sizing isn't the same across the line. they seem to be like buckle jeans. go to the actual wallflower website and look at the size chart for each style. if you order &#34;curvy&#34; order a size down if you aren't really that curvy. :) i love these jeans for the price and length but i've def. learned to check the style first!
156417	someone said these were like leggings, they are very stretchy, but they are still very much like a jean made of heavy material. i like them, they are correct fit to size 17. i was attracted to them because of the color, not many jeans are the lighter blue anymore. the  front pockets are actually functional, deep enough to hold items, that was an added plus.
156473	i was sent this invicta men's 10665 pro diver watch by the amazon vine program for review. here's my take on it.the stainless steel case is 38mm round with a unidirectional black-toned stainless steel bezel with white markers and a protected textured crown. a warm orange dial, protected by a hardened mineral crystal, has luminous dot hour markers and luminous hands powered by precise japanese quartz movement. the dial also features a date display magnifier window at the 3 'o clock position. a stainless steel link bracelet straps this watch to the wrist, while a fold-over safety clasp ensures its secure placement. this set states that it comes with an interchangeable black rubber strap, which can be swapped in to give this watch a sportier feel, however, there was no additional strap in the package, so i can only assume the rubber strap will be sent to buyers. finally, this watch boasts water resistance up to 660 feet (200 meters).i found the bracelet band large and will need to have several links removed in order for it to fit my wrist. the watch itself has a classy look, although i'm not a huge fan of the orange dial. still, it is a nice alternative with a smaller size and less features than the 1246 chronograph i reviewed previously.features of the watch include:japanese quartz movementmineral crystalbrushed and polished stainless steel case and braceletdate function with magnified windoworange dial with luminous silver tone hands and hour markersunidirectional bezel with black ringadditional black rubber strap includedwater-resistant to 200 m (660 ft)warranty type: contact seller of recordmy experience setting up the time, date: the accompanying instruction manual gives clear instructions. very easy to set with the three-step crown. (note: if you pull the pin out just one stop, you can set the date, two stops to set the time.) have had no problem with accuracy. all in all a good watch for the money.
156476	"when i received this watch my initial impression was that it was excessively huge for a woman.  it seemed better designed for a man's wrist.  however, i've come to appreciate this watch as a piece to add a bit of pizazz to a relatively simple outfit.  while it can command positive attention in the right circumstances, i wouldn't consider it suitable as an everyday watch.what i found lacking about the watch:1) the watch is very difficult to have sized.  it took me seven hours over the course of several days to get this thing sized.  i went to three jewelers that each sold a wide assortment of watches and was told by each that they lacked the tool to size the watch.  i was told to take it back to my invicta retailer.  invicta's site lacks a retailer listing so i went to google and searched for ""invicta+retailer"" and came across a forum where people were trying to find retailers to get their watch sized.  i ended up at j.c. penney and they sized the watch.2) this watch is heavy.  if you type a lot and suffer from wrist strain, i don't see this as the watch for you. i have strong wrists and this watch made my wrists ache on the days i wore it.3) the ceramic on the watch is easily marred.  i am in a relatively low-impact office setting but by the end of the day, my watch was covered by black streaks. i was able to wipe most of the scuffs and marks away with a shirt, but it has added a bit of upkeep that i didn't anticipate.what do i like:1) i like the appearance and that counts for a lot.  i never anticipated that i would be able to wear a watch that was this big.  however, it works well with simple outfits.  if you like jeans and cardigans, this watch can add an adornment that will hold its own.2) the face is large.  i don't have poor eyesight but the large numbers are nice even for my eyes.  i don't have to bring my wrist closer to my face to easily see the time.3) the watch appears to be well-made.4)other than size, it is simple in its design.  there are no rhinestones or diamonds (real or fake) or other properties that make the watch overly tacky.i would recommend the watch but not as a watch for everyday use.  it is a watch that you wear a couple of times a month.  it is not suitable for those with weak wrists or those that cannot find a retailer to have the watch sized.  from my experience, you cannot expect your regular jeweler to be able to remove the links unless they sell invicta watches."
156505	"i just had to have this watch after reading about its ""defects"". i have too many watches according to my wife and count several invicta's among them.this is a large, beautiful watch and i would have to say that it is the most comfortable large watch that i own, having displaced a citizen diver from that position. despite the large size, and i have several larger watches, it is extremely light. i really like the ""lefty"" style which allows me to wear the watch without the crown digging into my wrist. i have a significantly larger russian diver which i don't wear very often due to that problem.the band is great and i really like the fabric over leather which makes the band much more flexible.the face of the watch is very clean and, though their is a lack of contrast with the white face and hands it is not as much of a problem to me as others have expressed.the lume is very poor as on all invicta's, and this is the only reason i gave it 4 stars."
156507	i love invicta watches and to be able to purchase them for around $100 is a great deal! they are of excellent quality and i will explain why.i purchased them a few months back and i absolutely love them and wear them to death. it can be worn up or down depending on your outfit and i gets compliments from everyone.i was worried that the large face would make it seem too flashy and obnoxious but the sleek elegant and intricate designs of the watch allowed for them to be worn casually and classily(not a word).also, this is perfect for left-handed people such as myself. it is great to finally have one for the team! +1 bonus pointsbody: (4****/5*****)the face is large and brilliant and so well detailed that it is quite captivating and looks very sophisticated regardless of the colorway you choose. the quartz body is tough and can take quite a beating (i'm pretty rough with it during work and it is scratchless). as mentioned earlier, the watch is also meant for left handers - excellent! it is great for wearing out casually or by dressing it up. whatever you decide, it will work excellently! there are a variety of colorways and styles available by invicta, all for the same price of $99band: (2**/5*****)this is the only true issue with this watch. the band is a weird mix between leather and cloth and it is very prone to damage. i've had this watch for a 6 months now and the band has started to deteriorate from wear and tear coupled with water touching the band a few times. it has started to shave off and has become quite unsightly. i swapped out the band for a classic leather set and i am very happy. i was a little upset that the original band didn't fair that well but the watch is for a bargain and i don't think the makers were expecting day-to-day wear as i have subjected it to.price: (4****/5*****)$99 is an excellent value for this watch but i highly doubt that the watch is and was worth $695+ some time ago. clever marketing from amazon and invicta.still i believe for $99 you are getting a very stylish watch. you can find plenty of watches for under this price but i don't think you will be able to match the level of detail and quality. in terms of overall practicality, this watch doesn't really meet that criteria as the chronograph and other features are primarily there as a simple perk. still, if you need a simple timer, timeteller, and calender all in a stylish package - this is the watch for you! there is also a provided warranty for a year!summary -pros:+ price+ left-handed+ large face+ quality construction in that price range+ very affordablecons:- not many special features, but is mainly for style and quality- band is fragile, suggest swapping out or wearing more carefully.
156511	"i am an avid watch user and have roughly 10 or so watches that i alternate between all of which average around $400 retail. i had flirted with getting invicta watches before but never pulled the trigger on them because they are always ""on sale"" usually $500+ off the suggested retail price. with that said, i got this watch as a gift and love it. i'm a sucker for the large face watches that have extra dials and what not. it is a very nice looking watch but i wouldn't consider it the same quality as one of my name brand watches. invicta is a lower end brand that ""suggests"" their products sell for $800, but then do crazy sales and end up selling them for $100. so don't be shocked by the sale price, it's all a marketing trick to get people to think they are buying a product that is equal in quality to the name brand. again, this is a very nice watch for the price and i do like it a lot. i would not pay more then $100 though for any invicta product, other people online will tell you the same thing... all in all, i am happy with the gift!"
156561	"this is a very nice watch for the money.when comparing it primarily to a fossil watch i own that sells for the same price, this seems to be a significantly better watch.the invicta has a substantial build quality.  the band is very strong, and the lens seems to be quite scratch resistant.  about that lens: this is ""flame fusion"", which is their marketing hype term for a synthetic process making the lens similar in hardness to a saphire or a ruby.  this is an extremely scratch resistant lens, so long as you don't jam a diamond into it.  the watch is made of stainless steel.  since this watch is not plated i don't have to worry about scratches being too prominent (i strongly discourage you from getting a gold plated watch).  it promises capability of surviving 200 m deep underwater, and though the watch does feel well made, i am skeptical because the crown does not screw in, but rather presses in straight.  regardless, this seems like it's more than up to all the abuse i'm sure to put it through.this is a pretty large watch.  it has a satisfying weight.  the band is quite comfortable, but they give you a very long band, so 99% of owners will need to remove a few links.  jewelers do this, and you can also getthis product and do it yourself.  personally, i used a thumbtack and a rubber mallet, which is not something i advise!it tells time accurately so far, and i'll be sure to update if that changes.frankly, i can't see why someone would need a nicer watch than this one.  it's attractive, durable, and comfortable.  it is lacking a date function, but honestly those annoy me on analog watches as you inevitably wind up off a day or two.it's presented very nicely in yellow padded jewelry style box with one of those snug pillow things, and more importantly, the way they wrap that box ensures it's not going to be damaged in transit.  the yellow box comes in a tidy little white cardboard box that would wrap very attractively for christmas.  if you are giving this as a gift, i suggest trying to get that band adjusted by sneaking a watch the recipient already owns to a jeweler to match the size.for the price, i have to give this five stars.  i have a friend with a very similarly styled rolex submariner and this watch looks about as nice as that one.  i realize it probably isn't, but i think it's an excellent value and a pretty awesome gift idea.update: the chrono function stopped resetting to zero, and i wanted to note how to resent this.  you pull out the crown, hold both buttons down for a few seconds, and then hit the top button to move the chrono's 1/10 second hand an the bottom to move the chrono's second hand.  a longer press will move the hand farther.  when both hands are at zero, push the crown back in, and the chrono is re-calibrated.  it's not really anything i'm worried about, but it's something i wanted customers to be aware of.another update: unfortunately, this watch had water inside the case after some swimming.  none of the buttons or crown were adjusted while near or in the pool, so i'm very surprised by this.  i can't say i'm easy on watches.  the synthetic sapphire lens is utterly scratch free after many minor collisions, but people who get diver's watches will expect them to survive water.  i'm reducing the review from five stars to two."
156568	great watch... i've used numerous dive watches in the past 30 years; this watch fits the bill for weight a durability! enjoy!
156623	they fit well but again the wedge was poorly assembled. also thought the fabric was a more of a plain linen, had a little bit of sparkle to it which i liked.
156629	very comfortable hikers been getting the crappy nevados whose soles always wear out.these will last a long time.i wear a 11 but got wide feet so i got 11 2e and they fit perfect.wish i would have got these long ago, then i wouldnt been buying cheap other brand hikers.very pleased and when these wear out i am still going to buy hi-tecs they are the best out there!
156639	i bought this for my husband and he loves it.  you can't go wrong with totes.  he lost his other umbrella on the subway and likes this umbrella better because it's a golf size.  highly recommend.
156644	this umbrella replaced a long time totes that i had. the handle is comfortable and opens and closes easily. when open, it provides a large coverage area given how small it is when compact. i wouldn't call it &#34;golf-sized&#34; but it is certainly large enough for two people to walk under and stay mostly covered. only had it a few months so cannot speak to its durability but it seems sturdy and well constructed.
156680	may 27:  i've worn them 3-4 times each since may 7, and i have to lower my original rating from 3 stars to 1.  i wore the blue pair for shopping yesterday and came home in pain.  they have stretched so badly that i was walking awkwardly.  i'd have had better control with flipflops and more comfort being barefoot.  in addition, the footbed felt hard and lumpy as the day went on.  also, the red color of the insole on the other pair stains kneehighs, and it doesn't wash out.i tried on 2 other pair of easy street sandals/shoes recently and found them to fit as poorly as these.  easy street is not a brand i can wear.may 7:  i bought two pairs of this sandal, one red, one blue.  the size i wanted (7n) was not available in both colors, so i ended up ordering one 6.5m and one 7n.  strangely, the 6.5 is actually slightly longer than the 7.  the m is a tiny fraction wider than the n, but both are loose.  they are not uncomfortable, but i would be much happier if they were not so wide.  for the price, they are okay, but i will not buy more.  they just feel sloppy as i walk.
156731	these fit perfect and are light enough to wear on hot days.  i bought these because my long sleeve coveralls are too heavy for summer work and after looking at some photos of my grandpa and his friends some coveralls, i thought i could look as cool as those guys
156750	this is my second pair, because the others lost a couple rhinestones after a year of abuse.  they are so cute and comfy and i get compliments all the time.  the rhinestones almost look like a chain -they do run a little loose around the foot and i have medium to wide - so if you have narrow foot these won't work for you.  i wear an 8 - wish i would have gotten a 71/2 this last time, but maybe next time :)
156754	these shoes are just adorable!  i normally wear a 6 in open toed shoes and these were no exception. buy them, you won't be sorry!!
156914	unless you want a control top these are not for you. i bought these thinking that they were not control top. the fact that these are ct is not noted on the description. i do not like control top because they tend to roll down and make the fit of tights much smaller. these are totally uncomfortable and i am disappointed.
156991	i purchased one of these a few years ago.  i frequently don't want to mess up my nice leather gloves or i am out without a pair, and this little tool is very handy (no pun intended) to use in those situations. if you plan ahead better than i do, it's not an essential tool. however, i have found it  nice not to have cold hands when scraping the ice off the car windows. mine actually broke earlier this season, so i'm replacing it now. it definitely is only for light/moderate ice; it lacks the leverage for really thick ice scraping.
157003	keeps your hand warm while removing ice off your windshield! funky color and easy to spot around the house! highly recommended
157040	"i got the black version of this watch two months ago and really thought that was a beauty but this blue simply puts the black to shame.  dear hubby is still doing an irish jig over this and i'm sure he will be for some time.  it's just simply gorgeous.this reserve chronograph is a real weighty piece but extremely well made.  this is something we have come to love about the invicta name and product.  if you want a real watch that is beyond durable, extremely accurate and a piece of beautiful art to wear and show off then this is a perfect piece for you.hubby now has 5 watches with 3 of them invicta's and i also have a baby lupah and i really don't think we will be shopping for any other brand from this point on.  yah it's a bit pricey but really it's not when you put together all that you get in quality and durability.  as they say, ""you get what you pay for"", and such is an understatement here.i personally would have loved to see the blue on the face be more of a cobolt blue instead of a midnight blue but that's my taste.  i just love anything cobolt blue.  hey invicta how about a cobolt blue watch for us ladies?  hint, hint!the other thing that hubby and i liked about this one better than the black version is the white of the number spots has a silver ring around them making them stand out more.  i do think there is more contrast here which makes it a sweeter choice.if you'd like to see our list of pro's and con's then look under the save watch name but with the number 1464.  hubby put in his two cents on that review and i think it will give you a more personal feeling of the watch itself.  overall though, happy, happy, happy!!!"
157042	i wear 37,5 i have a very narrow feet but with a very high rise, so i ordered 7,5 b m usa they fit perfectly, nice design and right size, thanks. but why the hell manufacturers attached fake material inside the leather, no clue, it is not only the sole man-made but entire shoes inside have cheap scruffy faux material, if i knew that i would never buy. but expert said it is faux, shame on manufacturer
157055	pretty case! came quickly and was packaged well. fits my oversized sunglasses well and stores well in my car. love the design and color! may even order another!
157170	i purchased these for my daughter.  as with all flip flops, she went up a size.  with three ladies in the house wearing women's shoe sizes, we knew to size up.  these fit great and are holding up well.  she loves the zebra pattern.  and says they are super comfortable.
157187	this is my second pair of sanuk's and i love them!  they are so comfortable and they don't feel like heavy closed toed shoes in the summer they feel like you are wearing sandals (just as their motto says).  my only problem is i wore my other pair so frequently they started to fall apart (within a year).  i keep meaning to write the company and complain about that, but it wasn't enough for me to not buy a second pair and on amazon they were much cheaper than in the store (where i paid $55 for my first pair).  it's normal for them to fray around the edges so don't be too alarmed about that when it starts to happen.  my complaint was my baby toe wore a hole in the side (after 6 months).  the material is softer than keds, but i noticed they wear about the same during use.note - the sizes on these shoes are weird.  i normally wear a 7.5/8, but in these i take a 7.  both pairs i took a 7.
157236	this is a quality made tutu! it's made of good material. not thin at all! the colors are gorgeous and bright!
157263	i just love this piece! it is beautiful and has a great price! it is not too long and not too short, and has a nice antique look.
157382	i ordered this brand for the first time.i was extremely hesitant because the bigger the bra size,the more chances for poor fit.i was wrong.this bra is perfect.being so large busted,i hate bras with padding,so this is great.the lace is so pretty.i will order this brand again.
157408	i bought this bra last week and i absolutely love it. i wear 36d and god blessed the day i found lilyette bras. the delivery was excellent too.
157462	i really expected more of a quality product coming from under armour. they are liner socks but so thin that they did not hold up more than 2 wears. holes ripped right through the toe parts of the socks. look nice but not practical for active lifestyles!
157473	did i mention that i love this shirt? i was kind of leary about ordering this shirt because of other reviews,and well being plus size i am always leary or ordering clothes online anyway,but i took a chance and ordered this in the pink and the white. i thought at first that there were going to be problems because i ordered this on a wednesday and i did receive it till well over a week after words even though i paid for 2 day shipping (which they have since returned the shipping cost,and have been very nice about the whole mishap) so i got both shirts and immediately tried them on, and i have to tell you the fit is wonderful!!! they are very flattering to a plus size figure, i did order them in the 22w which is the size i normaly wear. they are nice and roomy but also very classic,nice to wear if your going out to diner with the matching blazer that is sold by the same seller,or for a nice evening walk. my husband sure thinks they are very sexy on me. so to anyone that is looking for a couple of nice shirts to have for spring and summer i would highly recommend getting these, i will be ordering more in the other colors.
157485	i ordered up mango but when i got it it was bright orange. am returning as color was not as described. the bathing suit fits ok.
157506	beautiful gown.  husband loves it.  i wanted the black and had to order a size down but it really fits larger than expected.  i took a 1/4&#34; seam up inside on both sides and will probably take up the shoulder straps a little.  i understand buying off-the-rack will not fit everyone and needs altering most of the time, so glad i can fix it.  i have to do this often with bought clothes.  really good quality gown.
157539	bought this as a gift and she really liked it.  nice fit, nice material.  she told me fit washed well.  she bought it in two more colors
157545	this shirt was huge on me and was not flattering.  i really like the style of tank, but will need a much smaller size.
157546	it was a nice color and good quality but had to send it back for exchange...way to big.  go figure.  i normally would wear an xl or in some shirts a 1x but roamans sizing is different.  i can wear a large!!! that in itself make me want to buy all my clothes there.
157564	when they say &#34;plus size&#34; they mean it.  really really large, but comfortable.  if you order it you probably should order a size smaller than you usually do.
157618	i like that they fit well, they have pockets, and a drawstring with a *lightly* elasticized waist (i can't stand tight elastic - i usually remove it and insert a drawstring). these are very comfortable. wash nicely, no shrinkage (though i use a cool/cool setting, and medium heat in the dryer).i recommend these. nicely made.
157653	i actually feel attractive again --  what a relief.  these are extremely comfortable.  the tummy control is very nice - a thin mesh panel.  no pain or pinching.  paired with a pretty tunic, these look excellent.  they wash well and ought to last.
157661	i bought this in the jade and in purple and i love it!  it fits perfectly, just the right length to cover hips and not be droopy looking.  washes like a dream, wore them all winter with a turtle neck underneath and when it got warmer wore it alone.  it can go with jeans or tights for casual or looks great with some bling and dressy slacks for a dinner out.  i loved these tops so much i bought some of the company's other things and was not as thrilled.  i am, however, going back to see if they still have this item in other colors. if you buy it, get your regular size rather than going up one size.
157664	"finally found a great looking double-duty long sleeve top for winter. just what i wanted...i say double-duty because this will look great with jeans or pants for going out to a restaurant or the movies.it looks like a velvet, complete with the velvet ""shine,""  but it's not bulky. it will keep you warm, however.the jade is more green than the picture shows, yet it is still a rich color.it seems to run true to size; i normally wear a large but got the 1x for extra roominess and it does not look sloppy at all. the quality of this top did not disappoint me.the sleeves hit between your wrist and thumb, but are easily pushed up the arm. this is not a run-of-the-mill top you see everywhere. the side slits are flattering and the shirt has a nice drape to it. again, i say yahooooo!"
157682	i've used this product before. was impressed then, too.  the fit is very good,they hold up very well with multiple washings.  pretty vibrant colors that don't fade.  the dark blue is my favorite. i don't think i've gotten that color before. the comfort choice brand is a good one to remember.
157706	i really love theses pants. they are so comfy! highly recommend! think i will be buying me another pair real soon!
157766	i really like pj set, however the sizes run large. i had to wash it in hot water to shrink it down. other than that the fabric and color are nice and i like that the top has pockets.  i will order from dreams & company again in the future.
157790	i love the length and material of these knit culottes. the only thing i would change is the waist elastic. it is an elastic waist but it is very small.  it would have been a aaa if the waist weren't so tight. it fits and i do love them.  i especially like the length. i ordered a petite small in a plus size from woman within. much of their items are plus size so it does take experimenting to figure out what size fits you.
157791	if you're looking for cooler shorts for summer, these are definitely not it!  but they are very nice with strong fabric, so i anticipate them lasting a long time. they'll even be warm enough to wear during fall and winter.  i'm going to order more in different colors for sure!
157830	i really like the clips for easy on and easy off if needed.  clips are a bit bulky compared to the little plastic loops from other eyeglass holders, so i need to wear them a bit more forward.  but the gold chain is not distracting against my face while wearing glasses.  i do like the sturdiness of the clips.  you put them in place, and they don't move.
157949	"they're longer than pictured, came half-way down my calves on me (i'm 5'6""). the material is a little thinner than i hoped, but they serve their purpose. they're comfortable. i don't think i'll buy them again, but i will keep and wear the ones i got."
158124	i got a grey pair for christmas and loved them so much to workout in i had to go get another pair.
158140	not see-through at all - they are actually pretty thick without being too tight. they work well for jogging/sport as well as for wearing out with a tunic. i liked them so much i bought them in grey too.
158144	i use these pants mainly to work out it. they're super comfortable and fit true to size. i'm 5'3 145 lbs and a medium fits perfectly. the only bad thing (which was to be expected with almost any leggings) is that it is slightly see through in the butt when you bend over, but if you're upright you can't tell.
158221	the fit was true for an athletic pant, but is also fine for shopping or lounging.  just what i was looking for.
158253	most bras don't look like the picture but this one does. it is true to size and looks just like the picture. it is comfortable and sexy. i plan to order more.
158354	i have more then a couple of favorite dive watches that go with me wherever i travel. giving them that extra bit of protection is important. my pelican cases have done a great job for me through the years. my only gripe is their price tag. so imagine my surprise when i picked up this invicta case. for the cost, the quality isn't that bad. the exterior is yellow and branded with a larger then life invicta logo on the top. i wasn't all that sold on the water proof hype until i tested it. the seal did hold its own with zero leaks.the interior is black slotted foam with cutouts for the placement of three watches. the foam is also removable. this case sports two lock slots and comes equipped with an actual working pressure equalization valve. the double throw latches are way better then i expected too. with the exception of the giant invicta logo embossed on the top cover, its hard not to like this product. its passed the test time and time again. for the price, you can't beat it.
158359	i had read that these run a bit small so i bought a sz 6-i usually wear a 5.5. the fit is good. they are really nice looking shoes. they don't have as much arch support as the orthaheel sandals but i prefer these to the sandals. these give a softer support. so if you like the stiff support of a traditional orthaheel these may not be for you. if however you are like me and find the orthaheel sandals to stiff but like the orthaheel inserts these will probably work for you.
158375	another winning piece (and price) from this seller! the necklace is just as shown on the product page, including the brown gift box. it's not an ultra thin box chain, but is still suitable for a pendant for a woman. 20 inch silver necklaces can be hard to come by; during winter months, the length is much nicer to wear with sweaters or turtlenecks. being a more substantial box chain, it's also more likely to stand up to daily wear. the bright, white silver is also nice.i wrapped it and tucked it into my sister's birthday box to go with a silver and pearl pendant she bought a few months ago. if you're looking for something small and affordable that doesn't look cheap, this box chain necklace fits the bill nicely. it could also be used with pandora-type charms.
158432	i have tried many other compression girdles in the past and none compare to this one.  it is very comfortable to wear, no matter if it under tight jeans or just a summer dress.  i love that it covers me from my bra down to mid thigh, all my problem areas.  it is well worth the price, you get what you pay for, and this item it great.  the other cheaper ones were just that, cheap!  the wink flat belly compression has held up through daily wear and weekly washing.  don't buy another compression girdle again.
158484	beautiful detail, fits well, i got the 3x and it fits like a dream holds you in kinda reminds me of a shaper.  good find and the price was right also ordered in white.  love love love this cami!
158492	great comfortable fit and deep rich black color with unusually nice rhinestone accents.  this cami is versatile and can be dressed up or down.  quite nice for special  evenings out.  highly recommend.
158525	if your girls are large, do not buy this top.  i got the 2x because that's the size i always need for my larger chest (dd), and it doesn't even come close to fitting.  maybe if i were a b...
158529	the seam on the cups seems like it should go under your breast, but there's no way that's going to happen so it sits in the middle, making it look like it doesn't fit.  the bottom stretches out and down and almost looks like it could be a mini-dress.  i can't get it to sit on my hips and scrunch.  the cut which i thought would be more flattering actually makes me feel like i look bigger.  i'll still wear it on occasions because i like the material and it's super-comfy.  but i won't be wearing it anywhere nice like i thought i would.  taking kids to the park, running errands, don't wanna ruin my nice clothes kinda wear.  definately not worth the high price.  it's more of a $9.99 shirt.
158557	i ordered 3 of the burgundy.  they are very pretty and flawless.  the only reason i gave it 4 stars is the color is more of a dark pink/rose color than burgundy to me.  but sometimes it is difficult to decipher colors from pictures.  overall, i am very pleased with the quality, delivery and the great price!  will be buying more for gifts!  thanks!
158619	i'm sure as of this writing, everybody who has bought a pair here did so as a gold box deal last week. for that price ($35), i cant imagine getting better shoes. they are running shoes, but i mostly use them for walking, lol. as with most skecher running shoes i've bought in the past, these have a slight angle that helps with pronating, which most americans at least, tend to do (walking with feet pointing out rather than forward). they are super bouncy on the inside, which is to say, they have lots of cushion. the blue and orange pair i bought also looks really nice imo, and the addition of an extra set of laces (one white, one blue) is a nice added bonus. anyway, i've worn them for two days now and am quite happy with them. for me, these shoes tend to last about 6 months with daily wear or longer if you own many pairs of shoes and alternate. if this changes, i will update this review.
158636	these are cute and i was tickled when i got them and loved wearing them. but the silver connection on one earring broke (without any assistance from me!) within one month of occasional wear and made all three dangles fall off. i only paid $9.99 for them but i still think i should have gotten more wear out of them =[
158656	this chain was purchased as a birthday gift along with a pendant.  i was worried that for the price it would look cheap, but it looks nothing like cheap!! this chain looks awesome!  very shiny and looks to be well made also and the length is perfect.  it compliments the pendant i purchased very well.  all in all i think it's a good buy!
158706	i was contemplating buying imitation suede shoes, and i'm certainly glad i didn't. these shoes are very stylish and have a classic look that never gets old. i did listen to other reviews and order a half size smaller than what i usually wear. this resulted in the shoes fitting perfectly. love the shoes and would definitely buy again.
158715	cute,  zipper in back means you only adjust straps onceankle strap accommodates my sturdy ankles good pop of color  go for iti'm a 7 bought a 7
158726	these are only fair.  i'm not crazy about the color.  i really needed a natural color shoe and this one is a tone or two off.  i also don't feel they up to cole haan standards.  they just don't feel like a $100 shoe.
158804	really nice pair of shoes. fits to size and looks very executive.  minor issue is scuffs easily but not big deal at all
158840	i was very excited to get these for outdoor hikes with my dog. these were the first pair of outdoor closed-toe sandals i ever owned. however, after a day of use walking my dog (on paved roads) and visiting the dog park, my left heel began to hurt really badly.i normally wear 10.5 size shoes but i read the reviews to go down on size so i got the size 10s. they fit perfectly and look really good on my feet. it's very breathable and the cushioning is very, very comfortable. i like the strap laces that make the sandals easy to slip on. the color choices are also low key and good.the thing that made these sandals unwearable is the heel part of the cushion. if you look at the product pictures, you'll notice the construction of the sandal leaves a gap between the cushion and the angled heel wall at the back of the sandals. since the cushion is soft (which is what makes these so comfortable), and the heel wall at the back is made with a harder material the cushioning goes lower than the heel wall and so with each step i take in these, the ridge of the heel wall cuts into my heel, blistering my heel.i can see how some wearers with different size feet (these do not come in 1/2 size increments) may have different experiences because their feet may not go all the back to the wall or may rest more comfortably. since my left heel rests right on the gap between, my heel gets unbearably cut by the back heel of the sandal.so bottom line: with amazon's free returns, these are worth a try as they're a great value. the materials used are great and supple, yet waterproof. the craftsmanship is mediocre (don't expect too much from these inexpensive made in china goods) and you get what you pay for, otherwise i'm sure you'd be looking at $80-100 tevas/keens. i can testify to the craftsmanship because i tried to make adjustments to the cushioning by peeling it up and inserting cotton pads. it didn't take much force to peel up the cushion pad and i saw that the cushion and sole are held together with a small bit of glue. if you want to set your sweaty feet free this summer, these are definitely worth a try. and if you're planning on using these for nature hikes on unpaved roads, don't. i tried these at the dog park where there are many sandy and pebbly areas and i had a hard time removing the debris (which there were lots of), despite there being many ventilation holes for debris to slide out.
158877	purchased  two of these beanies (subsequently ordered two more for spouse) to wear during chilly early morning biking around phoenix.  vivid colors, tight knitt (not bulky like most). excellent price with free shipping. highly recommended.
158917	thick and warm, in fact a bit too warm but nice a comfortable. i wear size m hats. this onesize cap fit very well!
158969	this bag is terrific. looks like high quality leather. the strap options are so useful (cross-body, or two shoulder straps.) can't believe how many compliments i've received on just a grey bag.i use this as a carry-on when i travel. can carry so much in it. does not smell gross and plasticky like some other fake leather bags smell. so so  happy with this. even the buckles are this neat silver-gold so anything matches. absolutely love this bag and i am ridiculously picky about my bags.
159014	this bra is comfortable and supportive, but was a bit stiff at the beginning. after a couple of washes it broke in. wished the back strap was a bit thicker. but all in all, for the price, great bra.
159045	let's just get it out there:  i have a very unattractive physique. i'm 5'10, about 180 lbs, and past middle age. thanks to dna, 3 pregnancies, surgeries, aging and 85 pound weight loss i am left with droopy, saggy, deflated balloons that need serious support and a squishy stomach that looks like a gathered bag of soft cheese.  normally i only seek out underwire tops and i go a little larger because i have a wide back. nothing ever really fits exactly right - how could it with all my idiosyncracies? so i usually opt for the best case scenario. i went with this top solely based on price and after reading positive reviews from big busted ladies.  so it is turns out this top is doing most of the tricks. my chest isn't supported as much as i'd like, but they aren't embarrassing sacks of mush lying on my tummy, either. overall, the top isn't as big as i'd prefer but it is long enough (which rarely happens).  it sort of clings to my belly chunkage but bells out a little, and is a little snug across my back, but it is completely fine and for the price i am satisfied. i don't have back fat, there is no exposed side boob, but i do have that blob of underarm blubber that looks like a tiny armpit boob. you can't see any cleavage and the straps are wide and adjustable. so, i'd say go for it but order up a size.
159106	bought the black boots and love them! they accurately matched what i bought online.  they fit true to size and love the faux suede and the buckle detail along the side of the boot.
159111	the watch is not overly impressive but for the price and the makeup it looks good and fits well.  it added nice to my collection for another casual and sport watch.  i love the way it looks and the price was great.
159112	i like these - they were very reasonably priced, and they're cute and comfortable.  considering the price of most boots, this is a very good deal!
159193	there very beautiful, but very big.  they pull the ears down and hang downward.  but when the light hits them they sparkle like a perfect diamond.  i'm returning them and bought the 1 carat studs for replacement.
159224	awful! it says unisex, but this is a very bulky, masculine design when seen in person. more importantly, it's entirely useless: the led lights are so bright you can't read the markings to tell what time it is. blindingly bright led lights. returned.
159246	"i have used mbt shoes since they became available in the us--10 years ago or so i would say. the first types were hard and heavy but the latest designs are a lot more flexible, breath better, and fit nicer! this one type, in particular, is my favorite and i just received my 2nd pair--the first one i got all red for using it in the red sands of sedona. =) i will keep that for just really simple things like shopping in the grocery store but if i want my shoes that look cleaner i will wear the new. i now only wear mbts and nothing else. i have about 8 pairs--from sandals to slippers to closed shoes that are more formal (for work) to exercise looking shoes like these--they even have boots now.i highly recommend this pair in particular for those of you who never had mbts before because this (i think) is a perfect ""trainer shoe"" for mbt's curved bottom and generally heavier shoes that work your muscles. it is also a very pretty runner--i use mine for walking, jogging, and running as well."
159291	bought these in sept. for the coming cold season so i haven't really had a chance yet to try them out but they seem well made and the fit is pretty good too. i have short fingers and broad hands so it is very hard to find good fitting gloves. mediums are generally too tight and large usually have way too long fingers. the pinky finger is still long on these (i have yet to find a glove that has the right length) but the rest are pretty good. hope they really are windproof since i plan on using them for riding my bike. i just had to try them out though for under $10.
159373	i'm a bit too young for slips like this. just not very fitted. works ok under a loose skirt but will gather under a tighter one.
159394	i bought these on a whim and now i use them every single time i golf here in phoenix,az. keeps you cool in hot summer as it reflects the sun off your arms and keeps you from getting golfer's tan too!  win-win!
159397	i wanted to say thank you to all the people who wrote reviews.  all suggested i order 1 size smaller than normal, because they ran big. i took the advice, and just got my beautiful moccassins that fit perfect. i wear a 7ordered 6 an bingo..reviews 100%.  spot on. comfy, beautiful and priced well.
159424	i wear only orthaheels with the exception of the saucony's i wear to work with my custom orthotics.  i wanted to transition them out and have a pair of orthaheels for work instead.  since i had total knee replacement i have found the orthotic foot bed of dr. weil and orthaheel to keep my knee in great alignment since i tend to over pronate when walking.  i have 15 pair of these shoes.  so i am comparing these shoes to the ones i already own.i purchased both the black/teal combo in size 10 and the gray in size 9.5 due to conflicting reviews on their fit.  i figured i would return whichever did not fit as well.  i was surprised when i opened the box at how &#34;inexpensive&#34; these expensive shoes looked.  however, being familiar with the quality i proceeded to try on the size 10.  i put them on with my usual socks and laced them up.  as soon as i stood up i knew these were not going to work for me.  as i walked across the room to a full length mirror i could feel my arch fall and my ankle give with each step.  when i stood in front of the mirror i could see both feet were  pronated inward and my ankles really off kilter.  thinking the shoe must just be too large.  i then tried on the 9.5 with the same results.  my heart sank as i was so looking forward to having the same great arch support as i found in the orthaheel/weil mary jane's, sandals, and even bedroom shoes.i removed the foot bed from the 9.5 and compared it to my other 9.5 foot beds and found there to be a difference in the height at the arch area.  i also noted that the 9.5 foot bed had &#34;10-11&#34; stamped on the side.  i believe one factor is that the mesh is just not that supportive on the sides of the shoes.  also, this arch support in the ones i received is nowhere near as high as the ones in my other orthaheel/weil shoes. i returned both shoes.  i may try the other orthaheel walking shoe and see if it is any better.
159437	if you have never tried this brand, do yourself a favor and buy a pair.they are the most comfortable shoe i have ever ever worn.the bottoms are a cork with a memory foam that are divine whenever you are on your feet.treat yourself to one pair and you will buy more.
159472	these are the most comfortable, stylish and versatile sandals ever--and so much better looking than the pictures.  i purchased the nude colorway and it'll go with anything, and i do mean anything!  the sandals themselves are exquisitely cushioned and feel better than barefoot.  my shoe size is between 7.5 and 8 and the 8 fits my foot perfectly.  i've got lots of summer sandals, but if i could only have one pair, this would be it.  jambu rocks!!
159511	"this seems to be a very well-made and designed set. the earrings are slightly smaller versions of the pendant. even with a loupe, the diamonds are difficult to see. because of the size, the set would make a nice gift for a dainty child who is careful with jewelry, particularly because of the thin necklace. the color is brilliant and clear and i can't see any color difference between the earrings and the pendant.pay close attention to the dimensions listed under ""product specifications."" no one should be surprised by the size since the information is available."
159533	first off these lee jeans fit great. they are roomy without being too big and they are very comfortable. they look good and the color is unique. they are a little light in the weight of the denim so i don't believe that they will last too long. when i opened the pack and took them out i thought they were second hand. it looks like someone has traveled across australia on foot wearing them and then used them for ocean swimming and wrestling crocodiles and decided to return them. i would love to get a pair of jeans like this in a new dark blue and get a chance to wear the denim out myself. if you do like your jeans worn in then these are for you. from the look of the selection of dungarees from lee they are all pre worn or stressed. these are a well made and well fitting jean. i will buy a pair of lee regular fit jeans in the next size up and see if i can get a relaxed fit that way. to the lee people*** make these jeans in unwashed colors and you will have jeans to rival levi 501's.
159589	only downside is the metal shakes a lot and you can't be quiet. aside from that i'm so happy i gave this brand a dry. feels like soft leather and looks like soft leather. plenty of pockets and lots of room!
159591	i have purchased faux leather boots before, and they usually have a strong, plastic odor that never really goes away.  these boots don't!  they fit true to size, and they feel surprisingly comfortable for the heel height.  since the shaft isn't too bulky, i can wear my bootcut jeans over the boots, leaving only the cute heel and toe peeking out, or i can tuck skinny jeans into the shaft for a more sassy look.  for $25, the versality, comfort, and quality are great!update:i have been wearing these boots to work in harsh winter conditions, trudging through the snow, salt, and ice.  these boots have held up surprisingly well!  the salt wipes off very easily once it has dried, and i have not slipped once.  the heels are showing minimal wear.
159599	i've worn these since i received them.  they are small but great for every day wear.  the price was right, too.
159626	i love the large size of these earrings. they don't look like they are real pearls but i will continue to wear them because of the awesome cheap price.
159645	just got my ray-ban 3477 sunglasses today. i guess there's another rb3477 sunglass with lenses that have more of a conventional tear-drop shape. the ones i ordered are the ones on this product page. they're a slightly rounded version of the square-shaped caravans (rb3136). i ordered the standard gold frame with 59mm non-polarized dark green lenses. there was originally a problem with shipping, but amazon sent a replacement pair out with one-day delivery at no extra cost. very satisfied with shipping and the product. also, even though my head's a bit on the big side, these fit well. and of course, it's ray-ban, so materials, craftsmanship, etc. are all top of the line. a bit expensive, but well worth it. if i take care of these, they should last forever. i highly recommend them.
159696	at first i was taken aback by the fabric of this top; i thought it would be cotton-like from the photo, but it's more like a spandex fabric that isn't tight.  it is shiny, soft and incredibly comfortable, light-weight and sweat absorbent.  i plan to buy another!
159748	this is nice and comfortable and moves with me nicely during practice. i'm actually going to buy more in more colors! oh, and i washed it a lot of times and it still maintains its color and stitching. thought i should add that.
159762	i don't even mind if its thin but its not.  i don't want my butt showing when i bend over :)  i even got a large to make sure its big but now it just looks wide and short.  oh well.
159775	it is as described but if you are expected something to cover your butt and be loose so you can have a fat day, buy a size or two bigger.
159778	love this top. absolutely the softest tank i've ever purchased. if you have a larger bust or are tall, i would recommend sizing up. the armpit holes do hit higher than expected though. but its wonderfully comfortable tank that is great for yoga, the gym, or as a normal top. im think about ordering more.
159883	i purchased this jacket as a christmas gift for my daughter.  she loves it.  be careful of the sizing.  the jacket seems to run a little small.  thankfully my daughter is very slim and it fit her but not if she wants to wear a heavier sweater under it.the jacket appears to be well made and does look nice on!
159884	i bought this for a relative for a xmas gift and she loved it!  it fit beautifully!  the sleeves were a generous length which, at times, can be a concern when one buys over the net and the descriptions rarely give sleeve length (wish they would!).  i would highly recommend this as a gift for the 'younger' set (teens through twenties) who are thin to average size....not sized for plus ladies.
159889	i got a size large after reading reviews that it is tight. i'm 5'9'', 140 pounds and size 9 in pants and usually wear a size medium top. the jacket is very tight and short on the waist, but the sleeves are super baggy. i didn't really like it. i'd prefer something tighter on the sleeves
159928	i always buy gold toe socks for my son because they last. they are often sold out locally but amazon always has them. these socks are very soft, so my son loves them. the microfiber is the secret ingredient that helps them hold their shape and resist holes. would definitely buy again.
159940	love these socks for my son. the stitching on the socks are minimal so we are not fighting with his toes to be comfortable in his shoes, and the socks are just thick enough and thin enough that he can wear them anytime. plus they are plush enough on the bottom for cushion and wear.
159949	i always want to get a pair of knee high boots, this is just perfect! i am size 8 on regular high heel shoes, so i ordered size 8 on this one, it runs just a little bit big (just a very little bit, not even 0.5), so i think an insole would get problem solved.these boots looks classic but fashion, on jeans, on leggings, both great! (mine is black color, shinny black)so glad i got them with free shipping, which is my biggest concern while comparing with other sellers, prices in same style of riding boots!oh! forgot to mention, they are very comfy too!
160064	this dress fits perfectly, i'm 5'8&#34; 140 lbs. the dress is very form fitting, so if you have a pouch or something you were hoping to hide, this is not the dress. it also is tight enough so that you'll see panty lines, so you'll want to go commando. the dress does not have a build-in shelf bra, i don't see how you could wear one w/o the strap around the back being visible, unless you wear a sweater.i was affraid it might be too short, but it hits about 3&#34; above the knee. i was also worried that it might ride up as i walked, but i did not have any issues.
160069	this was my first experience with that amazon seller. dress arrived earlier than was stated in order confirmation, so i was nicely surprised. i assess that quality of dress is rather high, and fits as expected to the body of my daughter who requested it. and she likes it much as well as wears very often. i cant say now anything about how durable is this kind of material used for production, but time will tell.  good thing for reasonable price - this is my assessment. i strongly recommend the seller because didnt let me down.
160153	nice simple and comfortable watch, just as advertized, and works well as i am wearing it now, paulhappy holidays to you all, give it a try, clean, professional and sporty.
160215	a nice inexpensive waterproof watch for general wear.  not a true divers watch suitable for scuba diving as it is not 200 meter water resistant rated and the outer rotating bezel rotates bidirectionally so can be inadvertently changed in the unsafe timing direction for diving.very lightweight due to the use of a resin case.  i consider this dial design to be very readable.  day and date adjustment are done the same way as on similar date display watches from both citizen and seiko, pretty much an industry standard.the luminous paint sed on the dial is not very effective compared to that on many more expensive watches and this watch does not have any dial illumination.
160279	having finally destroyed my favorite pair of skechers, it was time for a new pair.  i must say that i love that i can still order my size and know that i won't have to try them on before buying - skechers is the only brand i can do that with and i hope they never change it.my first impression on trying on the shoe was that it was quite wide in the arch.  this is easiest to see on the top-down and bottom-up product photos, and something i didn't notice until after i tried them on.  the feel of the fit didn't bother me - it was comfortable and didn't feel too loose - but as i was replacing a pair of lace up skechers that were much more narrow, i felt that these made me feet look very wide.  i decided to wear them around the house for a couple days and make a decision then if i wanted to send them back.during those couple days (and still, several months later) i was so pleased by the comfort level and decided to keep them.  the reason i replaced my old shoes in the first place was that i wanted something casual to wear to work, but that i could comfortably go for a walk in on my lunch break.  this shoe provided that, and i also liked that i can just slide them on and go.  i haven't had any issues with feeling like my foot is going to slide out when it's not supposed to, but my activity level is fairly light when wearing these.when it's time to replace these i'll probably look for something a little snug-fitting and sleeker, but overall this shoe works for me right now.
160282	the shoe is very nice with lots of class.  please note if you have narrow feet the shoe will look good on you.  es my feet border on the narrow to average width size.  normally,  i get a 7 in this type of shoe.  read the other reviews that said it runs small.  (this is one of the reasons i appreciate the review portion of the amazon website.)  i took the other reviewers' words of caution to heart and ordered an 8.  it fits like a glove!  very comfortable to walk in.  if you have high arches avoid these.
160286	these shoes are comfortable and look a little dressier than just flip flops for the summer.  i like that they have a bit of height on the heel instead of just being flats.
160298	i love this ring.  perfect fit, true to my size. simple and beautiful. perfect for my hands. very pleased with purchase.
160300	simply love this ring many many compliments!!!  fits true to size. the quality is really nice..i love it so much i wear it everyday!!
160313	super cute bows. my daughter always gets compliments when she wears these. i love the variety of colors and the price is great. some of the colors i wasn't sure i would use, but i ended up using them. the only complaint is the bands were a bit smaller than the previous set of ema jane headbands i ordered. i was expecting them to be the same, but they are a bit snug. each one is a tad bit different in size for the band, it seems. that is why i didn't give this a 5 star.
160315	i love these bow headbands!!!! my daughter is 3 months and i like her to wear a bow when we go out (you have to accessorize you know!!) but bows are so expensive and hard to find in a variety of colors. these are good quality and fit well. my daughter's head circumference is 39.5 cm and the headband fits loosely, but stay on. i like the loose fit because the bows will grow with her, other brand headbands only fit specific sizes/ages, but these will get a longer use out of them due to the room to grow. i am very happy!! and will be buying more!!
160331	these are not the ones in the picture and smell weird which is why i give it 4 stars. the lace pictured is very detailed and delicate, the ones i got are just plain ruffles of fabric, not lace. but they are still cute, fit fine and should smell fresh after a wash.
160449	if you are looking for something to wear a couple times a week or with certain outfits, this is a great choice. very classy looking for a great price. definitely would not recommend for every day wear unless you are willing to replace it quickly due to wearing of color.
160561	"my feet are always freezing and it's very hard to find any warm socks that aren't made out of wool or that chenille stuff that unravels. i'm very allergic to wool so that's out. if i did find them they were rather ugly or they were men's, and they still weren't warm enough. i have had the ""world's softest socks"" brand before and they were way too tight in the calf and not nearly as soft or warm as these.these are literally the perfect socks! soft, just the right warmth, and not too tight on my calf, they come in fun colors like pink and purple... instead of gray-green-brownish with the brand name plastered in huge letters over the whole sock like most ""warm"" socks. they even make your feet softer!the only drawbacks would be that they're somewhat expensive for just one pair, and the fuchsia is more of a dark raspberry rather than the vibrant neon color that's shown in the picture. (that might be due to the colors in my computer screen.) that's why they got 4 stars instead of five.i still love them, though!"
160630	"the idea is to make a wish on november 11,2011 at 11 am.i didn't receive it time for wish making, but it's a fun novelty and it does serve as a watch for the rest of the year.i don't see a compartment for a replacement battery.the time was easy to set up.the watch itself is removable from the rubber watch band.the band fits me fine, but i imagine can be quite snug. although it stretches,it doesn't really stretch too far and is not a ""one size fits all"".most likely it's best worn and appreciated by a young girl."
160645	this shirt looks great and fits really well on my husband. we are both big game of thrones fans, and he prefers house stark so this is perfect for him without looking too nerdy or anything.
160793	i bought this necklace set to use as chains for various pendants i have, giving me a greater variety with necklines. they are just the width that i would use for a pendant, so they certainly will do the job for me.
160794	i ordered charm necklaces for my granddaughters and the chains that came with them were very flimsy.  i found these chains and two were the perfect length (20&#34; and 24&#34;) for the charms and their ages.  i was a bit concerned that they might be to &#34;heavy&#34; looking for the charm locket but when i put them together they were perfect.  the chains are sturdy but still feminine looking.  perfect for young girls.  i gave the 18&#34; to my mother who has a tiny neck and she loved it - they're perfect for &#34;older&#34; girls as well.
160839	it's a christmas gift for my daughter that i think she'll really like. very pleased,i think  they look very nice.
160946	these are the most comfortable shoes i've ever owned.  i don't think they really work to get you in shape or anything, but they have a lot more support than any other flip flop & i have a pair that is over 4 years old & still look great.
160954	i have worn fitflops for years and needed to replace my black ones due to excessive wear. i thought these looked cute and a little different from the other styles i have so i bought them...and sent them back the next day. they did not fit well at all and were not very comfortable unlike every other pair of these shoes i own...and i have owned over ten pair in the past 8 years or so. the toe piece was very stiff and uncomfortable and the strap that goes around the top of the foot was very loose. sent them back and ordered the classic black suede...i know you can't go wrong with that style.
160989	i saw these sandals on a friend's feet....went on-line and found them.  they are sooo comfortable, you  could sleep in them!  received many compliments.
160991	preciosas, realmente suaves, elegantes, dan con todo tipo de ropa.  me han encantado, buen producto a buen precio.  me dan con casi todo tipo de ropa.
160997	these do not feel like fitflops, sole are not nearly as comfortable. the toe is more narrow than fitflops generally are, though i did not find this a problem. no arch support & stiffer footbed.  i've been wearing fitflops for years as i have problems with my ankles, back & plantar faciatis.  i love the sandals & clogs, haven't found any thing better but i've tried the shoes & now the sneakers & they're just not the same in quality or size. the size seems to change with the style which is a little frustrating.  to be fair however i must say i bought a pair for both my husband and son and they like them & would have rated them higher.
161005	i own several fitflop shoes.  i've been wearing them for several years now.  i have small wide feet and normally take a size 6 1/2 but go down a half size to a 6 in fitflops.  in this style , the width fits my feet just right but would probably be generous width for normal feet width.  so comfortable and stylish!
161044	this was my first pair of fitflops i ordered from amazon, after receiving another pair in a slide style as a gift. i have become a fitflops fanatic because of the all-day comfort i experience wearing these shoes. i'm in my 50s and sometimes have lower back and joint pain, plus i've suffered from plantar fascitis in the past. to my delight, these issues are not a problem when i wear these shoes. i've since ordered several pairs in different styles and colors. i normally wear a 7-1/2 m shoe, and i order the size 7 in fitflops. they fit perfectly. i wear this pair a lot around the house and neighborhood, but with the &#34;jewels,&#34; they easily look nice for social occasions.
161055	i was hoping for a styling but not over the top flip flop and these are great. fit perfect and feel great. they make my legs feel full of energy.
161064	i have worn this shoe line for 4 years now and i am totally in love. i have high arches so they are perfect for me with their arch support. these particular ones are beautiful, even more so than the picture. i have 6 pair of these, 4 pair of their boots and 2 pair of the extra warm clogs... amazing products, worth every penny!
161068	i have these in silver and black. when i started wearing fit flops i realized they run a bit large so went down one size and they're perfect.
161070	my wife loves it!  she has an older one and knew her size and exactly what she wanted.  when we went looking to replace the old pair, and saw the prices offered by amazon, with free shipping, she decided she wanted two.  then her sister wanted two.  i got two very happy people with these purchases!  thanks to amazon!
161075	i chose this rating because i'm impressed with the product.  first of all, the quality is good, the fit is right and the sandal's really cute.  i have nothing negative to say - i owned another pair of fit-flops that ended up getting chewed up by my puppy.  so i guess i could say the sandals will not survive aggressive chewing by a puppy but can anything!
161104	after receiving these shoes, i really fell in love with the mustard color. i tried them on realize that they run wide and plus i had no toe space. i ordered the 9 narrow and could not believe this was a narrow. it is a pretty flat but also too flat for me. i can almost feel the ground. i suffer with fasciitis so i need some support. and another thing i experienced is that the left shoe was bigger than the right shoe. but over all it's not a bad shoe, it just didn't work for me. so return label in process. i had th return them.
161119	these are pretty sandals but the insoles tend to stick to the soles of my feet and hence produce a slight suction noise with every step i take. i am usually a 7.5 m but bought these in 7.5 w because of past issues with naturalizer's 7.5 m ballet shoes. i have found them to be too narrow for my feet. so this time i purchased the sandals in wide, which turned out slightly too wide for me. but i am keeping them since they are pretty lightweight and comfortable,  and i got them at a such a good price.
161130	"yes, it's a 4.5"" heel with a 3/4"" to 1"" (depends on where you look) platform.if you're not experienced with heels like this, there may be a learning curve.looks absolutely fantastic with skinny jeans or leggings.  turn some heads!"
161134	"i had high hopes for this steve madden traisie pump - but was totally disappointed. i ordered two pair - tan patent and blue suede - and returned both because they were too small and too narrow. even if ordering one size up the fit is still too narrow for a medium-width foot. the ""blue"" traisie pumps i received were actually purple not the blue in the description and photo. i ordered size 8m however both pair were at least a size too small so it was impossible to get them on. also, heel height makes the shoe uncomfortable to wear for any length of time because the weight is forced toward the front of the shoe - either the heel is too high or the platform at the toe is too low for a balanced fit. returned immediately."
161281	i am obsessed with owls, and when i saw this necklace, i knew i had to have it. when it arrived i was very impressed with it's construction. the stones are firmly attached and true to the photo's colors. the pendant metal is strong, and i'm not worried about it bending and breaking. the chain seems very sturdy, and held up to my gentle tugging to check it's strength. the ring attaching the pendent to the chain also seems pretty sturdy, and unlikely to break while wearing. the metal is also a nice antique brass, and seems like it will be easy enough to match to earrings. the only think that i think could be improved on would be to put some sort of clasp on the chain. as it is, it is a solid chain, and therefore you must be able to slip it on over your head. it isn't a problem for me at this time, but if i were to have a moderately sized up do, then there could possibly be a problem with getting the necklace on without messing up my hair. other than that, it is a great necklace.
161360	not the best quality, but it is a very nice necklace. i bought it with a matching owl cuff bracelet and it makes a striking set!
161462	this is very cute.  it's not really my style so i don't know how often i'll wear it, but for the price i had to get it.  doesn't seem cheap, but the size is bigger than i expected.  i never did look at the dimensions, so it's my fault.  nice stones, nice bronze finish.  pleased
161525	it's just as pictured! got this for my middle school aged daughter she loves owls and everything with owls on it. so bought this for her came quicker than the est. delivery time and she lovesss it.
161577	i went to a store once and i saw few long chain necklaces and fell in love with some of them but because i didn't want to spend a lot of money i tried to look online. i was very surprised when i found so many necklaces for such cheap prices and i went ahead ordered many of them and like many others this was a very good product. cute, colorful and strong.
161721	i went crazy, i actually purchased a second scarf same color from same vendor, the scarf is so beautiful, i am loving the gold.
161724	perfect for the price.  i have bought a couple of these.  the work just as well as the name brands.  they are not as fitted as other brands so that could be good and bad.  i have washed it many time have no trouble yet with the workmanship or comfort.
161759	i bought the copper ones since i didn't care for colour and they were the cheapest. they came as described, individually packaged and labelled. i will go through them and check for damage or anything missing but so far all seems great.-----update-----so i did my checks and tested the sizes and the ones i could check all seem to be correct. so i am very happy with my purchase and i think they were cheap and a better investment in comparison to a previous set which i bought (the 15 set surgical steel by the same company); the only benefit of those was that it was surgical steel, other than there was no size labeling on the items, they all came in one bag and it was only 1 taper per gauge.
161794	i bought these glasses based on the other reviews. the glasses themselves are nice, cheap plastic glasses that you can find anywhere. however, they are too big. i don't know if i got defective ones or what, but they just slip off my face the moment i look down. it is not that the sides were loose, the frame itself is very wide. i have a wide face myself, so this means these must be extra wide. i bought them to save myself a trip to ross, but ended up having to buy from ross anyway. now, i have to pay return shipping. really not worth purchasing sunglasses from internet, as you cannot try them on and see how they fit first. piece of advice: try them on with the tags intact or you might not be able to return them afterwards.
161805	the necklace is very delicate, very light weight. i purchased it during a lighting deal for $59.99 which seems fair enough, but am certain i would not have paid full price or amazon's normal asking price.  though simple, it is elegant, attractive. i will wear this piece often. the bead's size are as described, but be aware that the picture makes them look much larger than they are.
161808	let's be clear, i like this item but the gold balls are situated on the thinnest chain i think ever made.  when the product arrived i struggled for 30 mins trying to close the clasp.  after looking closer, i could tell the clasp was either defected or made too small for the clasp.  my first inclination was to send this item back.  i didn't.  the next day after this necklace arrived i placed it back in the box and took it to a local jeweler and spent an additional $15 having a new clasp put on.  do not attempt ladies to sleep in this item.  it's delicate, it's pretty but look for defects with this product.  now, that i can actually wear the necklace...i find it to be adorable.
161810	the balls are smaller than i had imagined they would be in the picture and the overall necklace is more delicate.  it is actually much more feminine prettier than what i expected.  i love it!
161828	correct me if i'm wrong but the word sunglasses by meaning means dark lenses. not having any lenses in these glasses really defeats their purpose! i can't believe the lack of quality. i wasn't expecting an outstanding pair of sunglasses due to their cheap price, but come on!! no lenses? sheesh!!!
161891	this ring looks like real diamonds and it sits low on the hand so you can easily wear it with gloves. i bought it because my wedding set is yellow gold and i wanted something sterling silver. i can even wear my small wedding ring with it. i will also travel with it, perfect,
161913	this ring i love its silver its the right size.it looks amazing and it came in plenty of time and was packaged very well
161914	i love this ring. it fits great and looks great on. no tarnishing so far and i wear it every day. i'm glad i found this ring and it was reasonably priced as well.
161918	i originally bought myself and my two daughters each this ring and we wore them everyday.i lost mine down my new bathroom sink and was just devastated. i waited until i had the money to spend and it was the first thing i did, jumped on amazon and ordered me another one (along with other silver rings :)totally worth the money (nicely priced) fits well and is just plain and simple, which is what i wanted.
161919	love it.  it is slim and fits perfectly.  i followed the advice of the reviewers and dropped down a size and it is perfect.  i love this!
161942	i read the reviews prior to purchasing and knew going into this i would likely be sewing buttons back on...well, 3 days into wearing them, both the left boot button fell off. the buttons on each boot are connected by a single thread so when one comes off, the other will follow shortly thereafter. they use black thread on the brown boots so it's a simple fix with a needle and thread and it was noticeably loose on the left boot upon delivery. with the added pressure from the elastic fixtures that attach to buttons for ankle stretch, it's a design flaw perhaps that needs to be remedied with heavy duty thread.another issue with these boots is that i normally wear a solid size 9, but i had to order an 11 in these due to the thickness of the wool lining. i normally would order a size 10 with fur lined boots but this brand runs small so order 2 sizes larger than your normal for the best fit.other than the above mentioned issues, these boots are adorable! i have received many compliments and find them to be very comfortable as well. i plan to sew down the upper edge to make an outer fur lined edging on top of the boots at the rim since i have to sew on the buttons anyways. i did order both colors available and i anticipated the pink/white ones were going to be too difficult to spot clean since these are sheepskin and wool inners.
161984	this pretty useless as a bra, but the color matched the particular dress i bought it for so i wear it as a lace camisole with *another* bra under it.  the flimsy plastic &#34;support&#34; stays on each side came poking out after one wear, but since i'm unable to use it as a bra, i just pulled them entirely
161988	made of some kind of indestructible material with all kinds of pockets, even pockets within pockets. great for traveling and rough use. room to move but they still fit in the right places. these ship with a big, wide belt that has a pretty chunky plastic buckle or closure. the labels advise you to not use fabric softener and to turn these inside out before laundering. these look good, quiet contemporary and not stuffy. the &#34;charcoal grey&#34; color is sophisticated compared to black or blue imho. a good value.
162073	these are very pretty and looks awesome. very good value. i love them and always get compliments. you will be very happy with these.
162087	i got these without looking at the size, so that's my fault, but these are really for people that just got their ears pierced. they were a gift for my mom, and her holes are stretched out, so they would fall right through very easily.
162100	bought these for my daughter as a birthday gift. she loves them! says they are beautiful and also look real!
162177	i've had this watch for about 1-1/2 years. it's been a great watch.the dial movement plus the luminescent hands allows me to see the time in low light without the need of lighting it up. no need for people (like me) who are getting older and need glasses to read a digital dial.it is less than 1/2 as thick as a g-shock watch, and slightly narrower. it is also lighter than the g-shock.it has all of the features of a normal g-shock watch.note: it is shock resistant, but not as shock resistant as the regular g-shock.(i am in the process of replacing mine since i somehow cracked the crystal yesterday. i deal with heavy equipment and sometimes give things a hard bump. i am a believer that casio watches are the only wrist watches which will stand up to the punishment that i give them. i have only worn casio g-shock type watches for the last 20 years. i am replacing this one with another one of these watches.)accuracy is very close.here is my wish list for this watch:1.) i seem to adjust the time on it about once per year by a couple of minutes. i would like to see the atomic time feature added onto this watch.2.) i would also like to see it automatically adjust for daylight savings time.3.) it has a small information window. i would like to see a larger information window with larger letters in it.4.) due to the fact that i am ordering another one of these watches since my crystal cracked (after much abuse, admittedly), i would like to see a stronger crystal.update:instead of ordering the 800, i ordered the 800 instead. no real difference that i can see.
162215	i got one for my husband and another for myself.  it is very well-made and super lightweight.  the handle does extend plenty and is sturdy.  we hung all the extra bags from the handle to make carrying easier.  i was worried that it was too big for a carry-on after it was stuffed and expanded, but in 4 airports it was never questioned.  everyone else had them too, and it fit into the over-head no matter which way it was turned.
162230	this is a nice roll-aboard for the money.  most of the bag is sturdy / well made.  i am a bit suspicious of the telescoping handle, as it feels a bit &#34;rickety&#34; and has more play in it than i would like.  i have 3 other roll-aboards and all have telescoping handles that feel more firm than the one on this bag.  other than that, i like the bag.  i can fit quite a bit of clothing in it, and there is an option to expand it by opening the expansion zipper.  i did not do this on the 2 trips i used the bag for, as that would defeat my purpose for purchasing it .  i wanted a bag that would easily slip into most overhead baggage compartments in airplanes, and would pass the strict carry-on sizing that several us regional jets and most international airlines have in place.  this bag does just that.  the blue is a nice color.  the exterior pocket holds my 13&#34; laptop with ease, however, if you have the bag tightly packed it does put stress on this outside pocket and its contents; i have a heavily padded case on my laptop for protection.  the bag rolls extremely easily and handles well on tile, less so on concrete, and less so on carpet.  it zips down the aisles on the aircraft easily as well, and since it has 4 wheels i can push it ahead of me down the aisle!  (i love that!).  the 4 skate style wheels seem very sturdy, and the zippers are good quality and sturdy.  the biggest negative about the bag is that it does fall over.  when i used it, i did have the laptop in the front pocket, so this adds anterior weight, making it even more prone to falling over.  however, i think that would happen even without a laptop in the front pocket.  this was not a deal-breaker for me, but it was annoying, and i had to learn to make it a habit to put the bag face first toward a wall or table if i left go of the handle,l to prevent the tip overs. going back to the telescoping handle and my reservations about it's durability, only time will tell.  i know if i have any trouble with the telescoping handle in the future, that travelpro will stand by the product; they guarantee their products.  quite a few years ago i had a well used travelpro roll aboard in which the telescoping handle stuck and would not fully retract.  i contacted travelpro and they allowed free return of the bag to them at their expense, and replaced my bag with a new one!  that is why i stay with travelpro.
162238	i bought this as a carry-on that i could whiz around during travel.  i'm quite happy with it.  i find that on flat floors, like at airports, i can just push it along right next to me with little effort - as opposed to the two-wheel style that travels behind you.  people seem more likely to get tripped up in crowded airports when bags are dragging behind, rather than next to passengers walking to their gate.it's basically a rolling box, so it's roomy within the limits of it's dimensions.  enough space for a few days on the road.  it fits nicely into overhead bins on planes, or on the luggage shelf in trains. feels quite sturdy and durable.  the handle is comfortable.i like that there are handles on three sides, so you can pick the bag up from the top, and assist with your other hand from side or bottom while placing it into a car trunk, or retrieving it from an overhead bin.  the handles feel very sturdy.one down side i've noticed is when i am on a subway going to or from an airport.  because there are four wheels, rather than two, it is always rolling.  so, you really have to hold on to it when on a moving subway train, for example, or it will simply roll away with the rocking movement of the train.  when a two-wheel bag is upright, the stationary feet in front keep it from running away.there is a nice zippered mesh compartment on the inside of the front panel, which is good for ties, and small, flat items.  a handy zippered compartment on the outside front of the bag is great for papers, small electronics, tickets, etc.  it actually holds quite a bit.  that section in turn has another small zippered pouch that i find useful for keys, or thumb drives - the sorts of things that you want at the ready, but are small and tend to get lost somewhere at the bottom of a bag.there is an second zipper along the front of the bag that allows it to expand and hold more by releasing a baffle.  i have not had cause to use this yet, but i find myself sometimes unzipping it when i think i'm unzipping the bag itself.  for me, this is the one design flaw of the bag.  the zippers are right next to each other, and look and feel exactly the same.  i've added a small key ring to the zipper that opens the luggage to make it instantly identifiable as the one i want.
162320	my hubby ordered this in size 11 since this is the size he usually uses in slippers.  he got it just last week. he is satisfied with the fit and i like that it does not look bulky on his feet.  i would recommend it.
162360	ok, so i am not going to say they are the best quality in the world because that would be lying. but for the price i paid, they were great. the style is excellent. i bought them for my sons and they think they are the coolest things they've ever seen! they are good and dark too. so i rate them as a 4 because of their &#34;coolness&#34; level (based on 13 & 16 year old boys).
162371	i was really happy to find these and looked forward to them showing up but they must be real junk, they arrived broken!!  amazon is great and had it refunded for me! go spend your money elsewhere!!
162376	my husbands feet are very swollen and even the widest shoes have to be stretched.  i thought i could do it with these and he wouldn't have to have painful feet waiting for the shoe to stretch. these won't open up wide enough to help. very disappointed.
162448	rarely is a product that amazing that i take time to comment.  this clasp is fantastic and worth the price.  it can be moved from one bracelet/necklace to another any time but i will be slowing buying more to add to my collection of bracelets and necklaces so i don't have to move it around.  i like the big one on any size piece that has sterling in it b/c it adds a bit of &#34;show&#34; to the piece and brings out the other sterling in the piece. i will buy the smaller 7mm clasp for smaller chains.
162480	i bought this necklace because it looked nice. it looks very nice when i where and it looks a lot better then it does in the picture. i've had a lot of people ask where i've gotten the necklace and i told them thru amazon. i also said there where a few other others and you can get the chain in gold.
162487	this dainty necklace is so beautiful! the coloring is nice, the size is nice. i also like that it has matching earrings which i own. i recommend.
162493	this one should be a 10  !!!! the color is so nice purple ! sparkley too. many people love it !!  short and sweet pretty and oh so shinny !!!!
162504	these were ordered for my husband and his eye rolling when he realized i had ordered him a pair of green shoes was a classic.  he has wider feet and when they arrived they looked narrow and long, but the fit is actually close to perfect. nice leather and a good looking design.  the green is subdued and i like that no laces are necessary...a cooler look!  the shoes were a successful order and dh didn't have to go shoe shopping from store to store...everyone is happy!!
162524	these are just to cheap. they are smaller than my current handkerchiefs by nearly an inch. i should have bought a blended cotton. these really need ironing each wash.
162548	gorgeous silver earrings. sophisticated...elegant. they are dangle earrings that shimmer with movement when you wear them. they are two inches long from the bale. i world highly recommend these to anyone who loves fashion jewelry.
162560	my wife likes these a lot.  very different than anything else she already had.  and that is all i have to say.
162652	the shirt was way way tiny and see through. i wear an xlarge and there is no possible way this was one.  i now am going to give it as a christmas gift to my very tiny daughter in law. i was very unhappy
162654	this shirt is amazing! come to think i can rare into different size shirts because of different brands. i have a xxl in this shirt and it fits perfectly...its just the right length for the shirt and the sleeves are wonderful. i fully recommend this shirt and they do not run small. at least i dont think. i have a long torso but believe me im not skinny either. i have curves so this will make it look nice! thank you!
162655	fitting and pretty thin but really like the shirt.  the sleeves are very long which for me that is something very rare.
162697	i struggled to fit into my pre-pregnancy pants by week 10, but clearly wasn't ready for maternity wear.  several people suggested i buy clothes a size larger to get me through the in between stage, but i thought that seemed unnecessary.  i wasn't really gaining in my hips & thighs, and it was only the belly that was too small.  my pre-pregnant size was a 4-6 and i ordered the size 1.  i was able to wear regular pants, but was no longer uncomfortable!  i will tell you--it works better with some pants then others.  i wore it with a pair of my low rise skinny jeans out for my birthday, and it just didn't hold them up.  it seems to work better on pants that fit up a little higher on your waist, and it works well with shorts/capris.  even though i'm now in full blown maternity clothes, i can still use the bellaband with my dress pants when i need to wear a suit to a meeting.  that alone has saved me $$!  the quality is worth paying for.  a friend gave me a similar style from a knock off brand, and it does not even compare.  the bellaband is worth the money!
162712	this is one of those items you can throw in your suitcase and it will come out looking great! i love it for travel as one of those items you can put with so many different tops and with a varied choice of accessories you can dress it up or down. its great!
162727	i like the product itself my genuine red garnet sterling silver stud earrings 6mm and its packaging. the red garnets are not too little or too big, they are sparkling nicely. it came with beautiful little box.
162741	i loved how the watch looked and i loved the size. it came like in 3-4 weeks. the reason i did not give it 5 stars is because i had trouble trying to change the time on it. there were no instructions and quite difficult to figure it out. i had to basically mess with everything on this and then i resulted into simply just googling it. i figured out how to change it. i would have given it a 5 if changing the time one this was simpler.
162774	this was literally exactly how i imagined it, and it is pretty perfect. the length is great, the weight is nice, and its a nice piece to style along with any plain top. a lot of my friends didnt even know it was a clock too, so that's always a plus, it works great, and you'll always know the time is too. :)
162781	i wish i had not listened to another reviewer who had said these jeans ran small.  i ordered a size larger than what i wear, and they are big on me.  not so big that i'll return them and reorder my regular size....but i like my skinny jeans form fitting, not loose.  oh well, maybe others will think i've lost weight.  levi's are my favorite brand of jeans, and these are really sharp!
162787	this is type of jeans that has a certain blend to it. they are tight around the legs, but pretty loose in the hips. as for their style, the fabric even matches the likes of the rock revival jeans - womens sora b18 boot cut jean. i enjoy these jeans for their blend and i will go as far to say that they are a must own pair of jeans.
162797	i wear it as my everyday bra and i always cross the straps.  i am a 32b but i bought a 34 a if that helps anyone.  the cups run large and the band runs small.  a beige, seemless, no show through - no headlights, convertible bra without wires...thought i'd never live to see it but here it is.  not supportive enough for sports however... but great for every day if you don't mind a heavy duty bra.------- update.  i would like to add that it's fine for winter - but not for warmer weather.  it also makes you look 1 cup size larger for sure (i wasn't really happy about that - i like my own size).for spring, summer i wear this instead and cut/cross and sew the straps in back so they don't show outside of my shirts in the back.-------------- >>>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00389zgg8/ref=oh_details_o09_s00_i00?ie=utf8&psc;=1
162871	"i received my organizer very fast! it's exactly as described and shown. it's nice and compact and will fit most every bag i own.time will tell whether or not it stands up to wear and tear. it is a bit on the ...er...uh...""cheap"" side. but i don't plan to play tug-o-war with it with my dog either. the material is nylon and therefore does have that noxious ""plastic"" smell. i don't find it overpowering and i'm sure it will fade over time.all in all, i'm happy to have found a small compact purse organizer that is not made of peeled cows."
162880	i have a hobo bag that i use it in.  before this purchase, i had to search and find to locate any item.  i keep my cell phone, keys, pen, glasses, lotion, hand sanitizer and other miscellaneous items in it.  i even bought one for sister after she saw mine.  i like the light color as it makes it easier to see items.  my sister got the light tan color.  she is very happy with it.
162890	"i purcased the large size in grey with yellow trimalthough, i try to review many of the items i buy on amazon, sometimes i do not read the reviews on things that i purchase and then am chagrined and ashamed because i buy something that the reviews clearly stated was.....good, bad or indifferent...and i was too lazy to find that out. in this case there were so many reviews that i dcided against reading, yet here i am typing out my own opinion just in case the next person is more diligent than i!i purchased the large size in grey. i was very pleased when it came because it did have yellow trim as shown in the photo and i like yellow...and i like yellow with grey. i had in mind to put this in a new red purse that i wanted to use at christmas. well, christmas was christmas with the normal rush and all and i finally got the insert into the red bag in january. oh well, february and valentines are around the corner and red will look nice.then i started changing the items in my grey purse...which is really a medium sized bag...only 11"" long and 7"" tall with 3"" width....but within the exchange of about 7-10 items, i knew i had trouble on my hands. the problem was the organizer itself. it is padded. it is thickly padded. i got about a quarter of my belongings into the red bag before i gave up on the whole project. i just could not switch bags with the insert in the red bag. just not enough room. the red bad is, by the way, 14"" long, 10 inches tall and four inches wide. there should have been plenty of room for me to switch out bags. (course i was in the back seat of a friend's van while trying to do this...no where to run and no place to hide...either get it in the red bag or go back to the grey)!!! the grey it stayed. the red is now sitting in the floor of the entry way looking at me...the trip is over!so i was quite unhappy with this organizer. i do not recall reading that the insert was padded. it takes up so much room of its own that you had best be using it in a huge purse and best it would be if that purse was extremely flexible such as fabric or nylon. my heavy leather red bag could not make use of it at all. in fact, the only bag i can use it in that i have is a 15"" tote that is 12 inches high and 6 inches wide and is  fabric. it only fits in a very big bag. and of course, even if it goes in the bag with room to spare, there is the padding problem. the padding takes a lot of room. so a big, big, soft bag is the only kind that i have that i can use this organizer with. i am not sure i will try another type of organizer as i am really bummed about this one. if i do, i will read previous reviews even if there are a 100 of them. read i must or get taken every time. i hope this will help the next innocent who is not savy to organizers. if i had read, i would have known. i did not read, so i write....do hope this helps!!!!"
162891	my mother purchased the blue organizer and she absolutely loves it.  the blue is bright enough to make seeing into even the darkest bags easier, all of her things fit perfectly in the organizer, purse switching has never been easier, and it is small and compact enough to fit into even smaller sized bags.  wonderful little item that is a must for those that regularly use more than one bag.
162980	this bra is perfect for women! (or for men if that's their thing.). i put it on and tah-dah cleavage! the  quality and overall fit is perfect. don't put this in the dryer...it will shrivel. (i'm talking about the bra, not your girls.) i'm going to buy more in every color.
163040	i ordered this bra thinking that i would have a free return/exchange option since most sizes did offer that option.  clearly, i wasn't looking at this exact size and color when i ordered because it did not have free return/exchange.  and wouldn't you know, i had to exchange it - despite the fact that this is the size that i wear in every other brand.  this bra definitely runs small in the cup size, so i suggest ordering one cup size larger than you ordinarily wear.  the exchanged item (which fits just fine) did offer free return from the same shipper so i'm wondering how and why that should happen. check carefully for the &#34;free returns&#34; text on the specific size and color that you want.  on the plus side, this bra gets a big thumbs up for offering comfortable support without wires.
163084	this is a light sweater and the fit seems correct. i would have liked this even a bit lighter since it's so hot all the time in my part of the world. at night when the temps drop to 70, i like a very light sweater and this will work just fine. it is extremely casual, though. i'm not sure it would work in an office.
163112	my girl friend just loves this simple rose i gave the piece of jewelery too her for valentines day perfect gift
163115	this rose necklace is not only beautiful but amazing. the color of coral is brilliant, the size is perfect and the feel is amazing. silky smooth, and yet you would think it was almost real.  nicely done, and accents drab and fancy outfits - very stylish for any age.  a definite recommend.
163125	the wig is super long and tangles very easily!! but the color is perfect, matches the picture exactly!! wish i would have bought a shorter length though, but that's my fault oops... should have made sure i knew what 40 inches were... product came a bit early too... overall i'm please.. plus they gave me some fancy blue socks as a gift hahaha thanks!!!
163172	i've purchased softspots for years and always purchased the same size, but these slightly wedged heels run large and the leather is not as soft as their loafers.  shame, i really wanted to like these. but these require a bit of &#34;wearing&#34; before they become softspots.
163202	i read so many raving reviews about these sandals & that is why i chose them.  especially about the 70 yr old that loved them, not sure how she stood in them let alone walked in them.  painful & they went back.
163211	poor qaulity silver finish came off within weeks, not a good deal, i will pay more for a better one.
163248	i have been looking for a somewhat slip on sandal that is heeled but comfortable. this fits all that and it's cute!i wore it the first day i received it and forgot i was wearing heels. being able to chase after a 5 year old in these and still feel pretty is amazing! it's a bit more than i normally spend on sandals, but since i plan on wearing these often, the price justifies the look and comfort. if they last, i will be even happier!! :)
163287	i love this sandal; the size was true to form and height of the heel was to my liking; the fit was comfortable.
163299	i have worn other tommy products.  these underwear were excellent and have excellent stitching and design.  i will re-order again.
163447	i ordered these shoes for comfy work shoes as i am on my feet all day.  i usually take a size 8, so i ordered a size 8 but they are about half a size too big, this is unusual for skechers normally their sizing is spot on.
163482	"i bought these shorts in social blue color and a size 10 womens.  they arrived quickly and packaged very well as always.  i tried them on and noticed the sticker said ""10 misses"" instead of ""10 womens"" but they fit well so it wasn't a problem. (i'm not even sure there is a difference between women's and misses).  the color is nice and the material is a little stretchy but does not itch like a lot of other stretch jeans i have tried on.  the shorts come to just above my knees and right above my hips.  i would recommend these shorts to anyone because you can never go wrong with a pair of levi's!"
163483	these are a great alternative to pajama jeans which are more expensive. they hold up well to washing, they are soft and comfortable even when worn for the entire day. can be dressed up or worn casually. great buy. would definitely recommend.
163506	i have barely taken these off long enough to wash them, since i received them.  stretchy, soft and comfy, not to mention forgiving.  really great for when you can't get into your other jeans.
163524	love these! so comfy, and they look like the real deal. washed them, and they didn't shrink, whichis a plus! they do tend to hold lint, so turn them inside out in the wash. my mom wants a pair. i wishthey would come in different colors and styles, more distressed, or cords...that would be fun!
163545	these shoes look beautiful. i ordered them in red satin and they look stunning.first the pros:-finish: beautiful satin finish. they look (and are) very expensive shoes.-details: sparkly crystal detail. unlike other reviewers, mine did not arrive tarnished. the detail was wrapped in tissue and it shined like nothing else. also the shoes came with backup crystals in a little pouch, so in the event that stones do fall out, they can be replaced.-soles: beautiful leather soles, good for dancing.-fit: they do not slide off my heel like other pumps do. i could walk in them.-packaging: these came exquisitely packaged. each crystal detail was wrapped in tissue so as to not scuff the other shoe. each shoe was also wrapped in tissue paper. the pair of shoes were then wrapped in badgley mischka paper. they also came with a pouch to store them in long term. they also came with little rubber heel replacements, which was nice (especially since the heel is so thin, the rubber end will wear out quickly).now the cons:-finish: near the bottom of the heel, the satin was a little frayed. i am glad i bought them on sale for $94. i would have been pissed off if i had paid full price for them and received them in that condition.-sole: i wish it came in a different color. beige is a bit boring.-fit: these definitely run small. i am usually a 7.5 wide. i read the other reviews about the shoes running small,  so i ordered an 8. they are still quite tight. i could put them on, but they squish my pinky toe and my fourth toe. since i'm only planning to wear them for a couple of hours, i'm going to suck it up, but it's gonna hurt =) also, the fabric is very, very stiff. it does not give at all. i still probably wouldn't trade them for an 8.5 because then they would slide off my heel. the peep toe is pretty comfortable (i am very picky about peep-toe shoes, because if the peep-toe is too narrow, it pinches my toenail). these had just enough room for my tow to actually peek out enough.all in all it's a toss-up. they look great on, but they don't feel great. maybe they'd feel better on someone who didn't have wide feet. i would probably buy them again if there was another big sale.
163616	i chose this rating as i totally dislike this product. for starters it is supposed to be genuine lambskin, but the tags inside this wallet indicate that it is genuine faux laeather right next to the made in india tag. the stitching is very poor and the zippers are very cheap plastic. two of the zippered compartments on the inside would not even open. to me, it was simply a poorly made wallet and a fake to a name brand wallet.
163649	these have a nice fit, good coverage, and aren't ridiculously low. i am a 6, and like the other reviews said , i ordered up. the m fits just fine. for the price, you cannot beat these.
163656	these earrings are exactly bigger than i expected which is not a bad thing since they have so much detail to the design.  the pretty pink stone is small and does not show up very well in front of the silvertone metal, but they do sparkle when the light hits them just right.  they are light weight and i especially like the large earrings backs because it holds the earring straight and upright in your ear.i do recommend not to wear these for long periods of time if your skin is sensitive since they are not sterling silver and are just covered in silver color finish over brass.
163670	this red balloon watch is a pretty good watch when it comes down to it. it's fairly durable, not expensive, stylish and easily adjustable thanks to the velcro strip. i wish watches like this existed when i was younger! as soon as it arrived in the mail, my daughter couldn't wait to try it on, and wore it for a couple of days before she pointed out something that docks the score down. but she does like to wear it, and we're working on teaching her how to tell time. in doing so, i've noticed an additional problem which might not apply for everyone.the watch has a stainless steel case, nylon strap, a plastic bezel and is supposedly water resistant up to 33 feet. i don't know who's going to be letting their kids in 33 feet of water, but the watch should be just fine when they're in an appropriately sized pool. a few people have mentioned that the watch survived a trip to their washing machines, so that's a good sign that the water resistance bit is reliable. the design of the watch is good, though i don't care for the curved second hand. all of the usual numbers and features on a simple watch are here. no roman numerals are here to throw off your child. adjusting the time is easy to do, as is adjusting the strap. the watch comes with a little pamphlet/time teaching table that can be useful, but teaching time is just one of those things that kids learn quickly once they get the difference between the little hand and the big hand...then work on the numbers shown on the watch. still, it's a nice addition that a lot of watches i had as a kid never came with.now for the two issues my daughter and i have with the watch. my problem is that the print on the face is very small. yes, it's obviously going to be small since this is a kid's watch, but i did a double take when i looked over the numbers. my daughter also mentioned that the velcro started to itch after a while. she'll wear it for a little bit before having to adjust re-adjust it so the scratchy part isn't touching her skin. i had a watch with a velcro strap a few years ago, so i know exactly what she means. kids with sensitive skin might not be too fond of this one.just be aware of those two issues before buying and you'll be fine. this really is a cute watch and it's good to see one used as a time teacher of sorts.
163681	the watch is short my daughter is eight and i'm just the design is special to learn to tell time with very quickly learned the colors and the design is beautiful
163743	i use these sunglasses for cycling and they work great for that. they have a nice tight fit and they wrap around keeping the wind out. the brown lens is great for contrast and they are a tremendous value. the only thing that would make them better is if they were polarized.
163796	i just filled out the form to return this winder.  in my case it seems sturdy enough, and has enough settings to get it to properly wind my watch and keep the time.  when it first arrived a little over a week ago the winder operation was dead quiet.  i was very happy that it could sit on my nightstand and not keep me up at night.320 turns per day wasn't enough and my watch was losing time, so i bumped it up to 1080 turns per day.  however, after several days of running for 30 minutes, then off for 3 hours and repeat, the winder gears started making noise as the gears engage during rotation.  this winder sits next to my bed and the gears turning is making it hard to fall asleep.  since this is a two watch winder, it seems to me that they should have built it strong enough so that it could be on all the time, since nobody will wear both of their watches at the same time.i could move the winder to another room and keep using it, but if the plastic gears inside are already getting noisy in under 10 days then i don't want to experiment and see how long it will last.  if it would even run for a year and then die to be replaced it might be worth it, if it was silent.  i might have gotten a lemon, but the return form didn't make replacing it an option.edit - i bought the $69 accuratic single but expandable winder to replace this one, and lo and behold that one also started making noise after the initial 7 days of silent operation.  am i expecting too much from a winder?  in retrospect, i should have kept this cheaper double winder and just moved it to another room where the mild gear noise wouldn't bother me when trying to sleep.
163804	these are amazing cat eye glasses. they look great on and look more expensive than they are. they do feel like they might not hold up to a lot of wear and tear so i would recommend a hard case.
163807	i love these glasses they are very cute and stylish. i have received several compliments and asked where i got them from. i refered them to amazon.
163824	i cant stop wearing this cat eye sunglasses with everything specially my tiger outfit.. it is cute and the quality is good
163935	i like a wide toe box for my feet. something that doesn't squash my toes together and make hamburger out of my feet whilst walking. im a big dude and need the right footwear if im going to lose weight without injuring my back, knees or ankles, this is the shoe for me. comes in half sizes with a wide option. im happy with it.
164024	it is a bit larger than it appears.  i bought it for a small person.  but still very cute.  for an average person in size.  scarf to mitts a bit long on the small person i bought it for.  but i would buy it again.
164074	i really like the watch, but i received one with an allen screw missing on the faceplate. not a real big deal but i don't feel like paying shipping on a $25 watch to get a new screw. called armitron parts department and was told they don't bother with just screws so i was outta luck. bad customer service = me no more a customer. i'll go with a pricier g-shock next time. for now i'll just check the micro screws at the hardware shop and hope i get lucky.*updated*i guess the right people we're monitoring the reviews because i was contacted and offered a free replacement watch because of the missing screw. all is right now. new watch showed up and with all parts! would purchase again!
164215	good quality product, but description was not correct.  this product does not have expandable waistband.  other than that, no complaints.
164295	i chose this ring because citrine/topaz is my birthstone and the only birthstone ring i ever had was a large smoky topaz cocktail ring, which is too overwhelming for my small fingers.i saw this and loved the shape and the multi-colors, and on a whim, i ordered it. when it arrived, i was just delighted with it. much better size for my hand, plus appropriate for both daytime and dress up. i have complaints at all. in fact, i'm very happy with my choice.
164298	i bought these as i've always had these type of earrings in the upper area on my left ear.  i lost the ones i wore for years and really wanted this type of closure again, as it stays closed and they're very comfortable to sleep on.  arrived very quickly, very pleased.
164488	i got these earrings as a gift and my sister loves them. i wish they sold jewelry sets so i can buy them as gifts
164566	i love this. it did not slip at all and it didn't squeeze my thighs, giving it a muffin top effect! i also like the quality of this. very thick but at the same time it's opaque.
164572	these are the bomb!  i can't wait for the weather to turn cold so i can wear these. they are super comfortable and will stay up all day.  i  like the quality and the material is very smooth and solid enough that they look like socks to everyone else. the silicone bands around the thigh are just strong enough to hold them up without being too tight.
164693	these gloves are great. i got them for my brother-in-law who walks his dog in the cold winter weather. work great with the phone.
164799	a great shirt for outdoor activities. fast drying. protection from uv rays. just make sure you order 1 size up.
164823	my husband loves it. he wear it at once when we got those shorts in a mail box. he he looks good in it. quality is wonderful and price was too!
164888	not all turquoise is equal in value or collectibility; most turquoise sold in the u.s. today is from china, has been dyed and stabilized. nothing wrong with that, as long as the customer is paying accordingly. for collectors (and fans) of american southwest jewelry, there are still a few mines in operation, such as the kingman mine. colors vary by nature. carolyn pollack has--for some jewelry designs--used turquoise from a specific, new vein at the kingman mine that's a bright, true teal or turquoise hue. this ring being one example. there's very light veining in the ring i received, it's beautifully cut and polished, and sits securely in a hefty amount of sterling silver in a simple, elegant design that's very flattering on the finger. all measurements stated on the product page are true, and sizing appears to be very true to size. the ring is comfortable as well. classy!all carolyn pollack pieces are made in the u.s.a. of recycled sterling silver. this ring, using a stone from an american mine, shows pride of workmanship and is suitable even if you're not into a seriously southwest style. it's both contemporary and classic. did i mention gorgeous?turquoise stones should be protected from chemicals and never placed in a heated, ultrasonic jewelry cleaner. to clean my silver pieces, i just use a small amount of plain, white toothpaste on a dry cloth (avoiding the stones as much as possible), and then rinse under plain water when the tarnish is removed.
164894	great tights!  i have similar tights in black and these will keep you warm under pants (they are not too heavy to wear this way) or under a nightdress!  wonderful~!
164907	i really love these. i am using them for a costume and they arent too thick in the fingers to still use my touch cellphone
164925	"i bought the electricity/dark onix medium for my 5'9"" 185 athletic pounds and it fits nicely.  i love the super bright neon lime green color.  makes it all the better to see you if you happen to be walking or jogging when the sun is going down."
164946	i am totally impressed with the quality of this bracelet.  it is made with solid hematite beads.  it is not held together with cheap thin pieces of elastic like others are, it is held together with a substantial piece.  price is fantastic, i highly recommend this bracelet!
164986	this ring arrived on time and is very colorful and pretty. if i had to list something that i don't like, it would be that in some of the setailed areas, the silver does not look very polished, but rather rough/raw if you will....but it is a perfect size and has a lot of color to it.
165029	"these were good regular hose, no imperfections that i could find.  i am outside of their regular ""fit"" zone at 5' 11"" but they still fit me just fine."
165049	fit perfectly. i wear a size 5 and i got a medium and its great(: looks just like the picture
165104	i was looking for some flip flops that provided good arch support. these are okay, i think they could have a little more arch support, but i still like them. i bought them in white, they wash easily when they get dirty just with some soap and water. they are very light and comfortable.
165109	maybe it is just me, but i thought i had found a bargain that held a regular (not american girl) doll. what a joke on me:) this thing is so tiny it doesn't even hold supplies for a doll! i need to read the description better. did not try to send it back!
165111	very well made, holds an unbelievable amount. matches grandgirls from llbean.  she loves it beyond words. need it in other colours though
165191	"for ""modern fit"" these were huge.  i have a charcoal version of these pants that fit great.  the khaki ones in the same size, however, have much wider legs.  the waist fits the same, but the look is just horrible.  had to return these."
165225	the product is cheap and basic. it doesn't look nice so i usually wear something extra on the outside. but the neck always shows up. i don't like it very much.
165241	i like these hanes white x-large, they are nice soft cotton materiel.i am 6'3&#34; and sometimes the tee,s are not long enough, but these are just right for a tall man ,i like these t-shirts  a lot.thank you amazon.com.
165389	pros:the shorts fits as i would expect. they have the classic dickies stiffness to the which is a little uncomfortable at first but i expected that. they fall between 2-3 inches below the knee on me, i am 5'11&#34; and i wear them around my hips. other than that they seem really sturdy and the pockets or pretty good.cons:the one complaint i do have it that the front pockets are oddly narrow. this may be a standard dickies feature but it is annoying and uncomfortable for my hands or keeping regular items, like my phone, in them.
165407	i am a huge fan of hotmilk nursing bras.  i can't wear underwire bras while nursing full-time because i end up with clogged ducts (ouch!).  however, wire-free bras have never given me the support that my ff chest needs.  my first hotmilk bra (the luminous style) changed all of that!  it was so supportive and comfortable.  i have 3 hotmilk nursing bras now.  this black eclipse bra is my 2nd favorite.  it's not quite as supportive as the luminous, but the cups are well structured and it's comfortable to wear.  oddly, it looks almost the same as the luminous (which is why i bought it), but the bottom band doesn't lay as flat or stay in place as well (which is why it doesn't support as much).  it does hide my nursing pads a little bit better than the luminous though.  overall, i'm happy with the bra and it's still vastly superior to the majority of the nursing bras out there, especially when you factor in the price.  luminous is my favorite, but this one still gets tons of use!
165503	i ordered this the size it said i should, and when i tried it on, it fit large on me and didn't smooth out anything.  it was never worn and i gave it away to someone else.  i would recommend ordering a size or two smaller if you actually want it to do anything.  the fabric was nice and smooth though.
165547	instead of carrying flowers in my wedding, i got these bags for my bridesmaids to carry down the aisle in my wedding. they looked great and were different than anything else i've seen in a wedding- which i like.
165554	i like the built in bra and the control smooths out my tummy really well.  i have a lot of dress's with thin or clingy fabric and purchased this slip to eliminate the bra and panty lines.  it works great and i really like soft fabric.  the only thing that i dont like is the straps are further out than regular bra straps and rub around my arm area.
165663	i love these sunglasses because they are so summer-y and fun. they kinda remind me of the 80s. people looking at you won't be able to see through the lens, so that's a plus.
165680	i have gone through a dozen pairs of slippers looking for the perfect pair, and i have, at long last, found them. i love that the soles are rubber, providing traction and allowing me to walk through puddles. the insides are squishy and super comfortable. i have to wear socks with them or else my feet sweat a little and make the insides gross. i wear them all of the time and since they won't get ruined if i wear them outside, i can wear them to check the mail, let the dog out, run to the grocery store, or any place i go where i wish to have warm, cozy feet. i would definitely recommend to any woman (for they are not masculine due to the fur) and i will probably buy these for my sister for christmas!
165741	once i got the size fixed, i was able to enjoy this shirt.  many years ago someone gave me the exact same shirt in blue.  i wore it til i wore it out.  was i ever happy to find it again and in my favorite color of rose mist. love love love
165773	this item is perfect for going out to clubs.  they are very cute tights and really attract attention when you enter a room. my only gripe is if you have wide hips and big thighs beware they were a bit tight. i got slight stretching rips in them when i wore them out for the first time, and im an average weight of 155, certainly not a big girl just average girl with big hips. just a heads up. other than that i love them, they will last for a long time if you care for them properly. all in all a decent buy.
165834	the new balance women walking shoe met my expectation and beyond.  a very comfortable walking shoe.  recommend it highly.dorothy walkernashville, tn
165901	after i read some reviews, i tried to cancel this order within 24 hours with no success.  the material is supposed to be linen but appears to be some kind of cheap, thin polyester.  the sizing is huge and too long (even on my 5'10&#34; frame.)  i sent them back and am now waiting for a refund.  to add insult to injury i was told that i would have to pay a $7.50 return shipping fee.  no more orders from this vendor for me!
166069	i'm usually a small, and it fits ok in the arms, but the cowl neck is so large/low that i need to wear another shirt underneath it so i'm not giving everyone at work a show lol.otherwise very nice. can't remember is there was an xs available, but i would say order 1 size smaller than you wear.
166136	these shoes fit perfectly and they are very handsome too.  these shoes are very well made and are great for walking. i highly recommend them.
166168	i wish i had not listened to the reviews that said to size up. i'm a size 8, sometimes 8.5. i went with the 8.5 in this shoe and it is too large. there is extra room both in the length of the toe bed and in the heel, so my foot keeps slipping out. if i keep them, i'll only be able to wear them with tights or socks. they are cute, but frankly not very well constructed. and there is no arch support whatsoever. i got these for a good deal, so i'm not complaining, but i would have been seriously disappointed if i'd paid full price.
166177	this skirt is very cute.  i ordered a 2x and i wear a 20 at lane bryant.  it is tight but it fits.  the fabric is thick and very stretchy.  it has a slit up the back and could be worn at various waist heights.  great for the money!
166179	this skirt fits like a dream! i ordered a size up because i was worried about it being too tight from the other reviews and i am glad i did. plus, the 2x was out of stock, so i had to get the 3x. i love that the skirt has so much stretch, so i can move in it comfortably and move it a little higher or lower depending on how i want it to look. i tried it on without spanks and you definitely need support garments with it because of the form-fitting look. i can tell once i get the whole look together it will be fabulous!
166195	sizing is true, i feel very feminine and sexy in this top.  the material is flowy and just right.  i can't wait to pair with red accessories and a red bra just enough cover to leave a little something to the imagination!!!  oh yeah this top is &#34;super turned up&#34;
166203	i have wanted this shirt for over a year and i finally just spent the money and got it. i knew that it was going to be open in the front so i bought a black bra. i thought it would be fun and flirty. what i did not know, however; was the sides are completely open. i mean completely. these are not bat wings the material is attached but only at the very bottom so i wear this cute new shirt with my sassy black bra and walk into the room waving at everyone just to be mortified to find out that all my business (meaning my rolly pollies) were hangin out. how embarrassing. really, i don't know how in the world i missed this important fact.
166218	don't just assume that its your size because it says your usual size. you need to read the sizing info before you purchase any item of clothing. people are saying this was too small and to order a size bigger.. i would be upset but this looks cute as a dress too!! lol. just measure yourself and follow the sizing chart. i'm thin and ordered 3x. its pretty big on me, i would have ordered 2x which was my size on the sizing chart. love this item. just freaking cute. get it.
166221	this  arrived in good time and was really cute right out of the box.  nice, stretchy, soft fabric but much too small in the hips, and oddly too big in the waist.  i checked the size before i bought it and the 2x was well within my  measurements.  i may try a 3x because i loved the look and feel.
166232	maybe because of how it looks in the picture/on the mannequin, but i thought the top of it would be a little tighter than the rest. while the structure of it does curve a bit, it's not as much as shown.i bought the black color, size 1x.it's a little big on me. i wear a size 14/16 in old navy brand skinny jeans, but my bum is large (48&#34;). i will have to find a way to wear it, probably pulled up a little and rolled, in order for it to fit how i want. i might even be able to bring it in a little.overall, it is a high quality piece, and i would recommend it to someone looking for a plus size pencil skirt. i only share my problems with it for others who might be in between plus sizes and &#34;regular&#34; sizes like i am.
166257	wore as a dress and it was perfect.  the material is a bit thin but definitely not see thru.  it is stylish and i got lots of compliments
166312	this cargo pants set is very nice and comfortable, the set does not look like workwear, they are boot cut, which makes them look better, thank you amazon!
166319	i really like the look of this watch and i purchased it at a great price (lightening deal).  i love the black and rosegold as well as the all-metal band.  the watch is large enough without being gigantic.  the watch also does a very good job of keeping time.my problem is the band itself.  it is too short length-wise.  meaning when i clasp the band around my wrist, i would prefer more room to move.  most watch bands come far to big and you have to remove a couple links.  this watch band comes far too small and there is nothing you can do about it.that being said, i still like the watch but only wear it occasionally.**update** - i contacted customer service via email asking for additional links.  the customer service rep replied extremely quickly and said they would send me 3 additional links at no cost!!  i am extremely pleased with their customer service.  i wish more companies would do this.  i changed my rating from 3 stars to a solid 5 stars and wish i could rate higher.
166337	i have never had a bra that managed to mash one part of my boob down flat while creating &#34;butt-boob&#34; on the top and them pointing them in weird directions. if i wore it, i'd look deformed.it may be okay if you have boobs like the model--a/b cups. the straps are comfy.
166396	these are too big to fit in some card wallets.  might as well just get an rfid wallet and forget the sleeves.  unless, you only want to carry a card and no wallet.
166419	great hat. attractive design, fashionable and warm.con: not long enough to cover the ears when extra protection is needed,
166526	no seriously, this sports bra is hands down the best sports bra i have ever owned. how much did i love it? enough that when the hooks failed after a few hours of initial wear i immediately arranged to exchange it. i'm not scared that this was a crap product.so let's just stick this out front and in the open: i'm a short person with huge bosoms. i play a high impact sport and am very active at least 6 hours every week in addition to several more hours of mild to moderate activity. up until this little wonder came into my life i've been relying on a a brand that rhymes with thunder farmer to tame the girls. at best i would call that experience &#34;meh,&#34; especially compared to this bra. in retrospect i was clearly wearing the wrong size- actually, i would say i've been wearing the wrong size since the first time i tucked the projecting womanhood into a bra.i digress: if you are relying on what the old lady with the paper tape measure at the big box chain store told you is your size you are probably wearing the wrong size. if you walk into a fitting and they tell you to add four inches, just walk away. this is a big fat lie. why would you do that? if your band (or underboob, whatever you want to call it) is 30 why would you suddenly and arbitrarily say it's a 34? once you get that through your head it's a really simple thing to figure out your cup size. bend over, let the hanging baskets descend in all their glory, measure loosely, and you're done. for uk sizing, my underboob measured 29 (went with 30), the baskets hit 10 inches, so that says i'm a 30gg. simple. moving on.in the thunder farmer i was wearing a 34dd because that's as big as they get. it never felt like it was as supportive as a high impact sports bra should be but it seemed like it was the best out there. man, was i wrong. i was skeptical that i was wearing the wrong size, and even more skeptical that this bra would be the magical rainbow unicorn of sports bras. amazon has been fabulous to work with and the return policy for prime is more than fair, so i figured i had nothing to lose. a gamble, add to cart, two days later the box arrives, and i tried it on.just trying it on was a whole other adventure that i won't spoil for other newcomers that are coming to the light from the dark side of vicki's (dirty little) secret. &#34;is it seriously supposed to be this tight?&#34; &#34;and now i'm supposed to bend over and wiggle everything into the cups how?&#34; &#34;but this is a sports bra, why are there two distinct bumps instead of tubeboob?&#34; and my favorite &#34;holy crap, i can see my feet when i look down. is that what's supposed to happen when the gore actually rests against your skin?&#34; (note: look up what bra parts are if you don't know what the gore is).again, i was skeptical, but luckily i had a three hour high intensity event the following morning and felt like it was the perfect time to take it for a test drive. first up: jumping. let's just say that busty girls do not like jumping. not even a little. even if you manage to tame the girls into minor submission you can still feel your breast tissue shifting across the top of your chest, across your pectoralis muscles. after a while you start to feel it in your neck and shoulders, and eventually it creeps all the way into your lower back and ribs. so jump i did, keenly aware that this was a great test of the &#34;86% reduction in bounce&#34; claim. especially since the breasts were actually separated and not mushed together into the equivalent of wrapping an elastic bandage around your chest. i'm not exaggerating when i saw i felt nothing. not even a little jiggle. jumped again. and again. over and over, and not once did i feel that familiar tug across my chest.then it was a bunch of lateral agility stuff, then hitting (for the record, i play roller derby). and being hit. after three hours i noticed that i had zero pain associated with bounce and fatigue from trying to compensate for the bounce. i had a serious neck injury almost one year ago so i've been keenly aware of just how much pain the bounce can create in a matter of minutes. did i say i had zero pain? because that's a really important detail.once the event was over i had another event to plan for that night, a full game with a four hour drive. when i got home i took this off. warning- it takes a couple times wearing it to get used to the difference in how tight the band is in comparison to the poorly fitting band you may have been wearing until then. my skin was a little red where the wires sat, and there were a couple other marks on my back and small ones on the back of my shoulders from where you can clip it together for a racerback style. no biggie. after a quick lunch and clean-up i noticed that two of the three hooks had pulled away from the band rather significantly, and not in a way that i could fix, so i knew i would need to exchange it. shrugged it off, i had to go, so i put it back on and left it alone for almost seven more hours.since setting up to exchange with the first one until now i have had no problems with the replacement. i wear this for every single practice, event, work-out, and even the days i'm just going to be moving around a little more than usual. it is honestly the perfect sports bra. i love that it can be easily converted to a racerback style that provides a little bonus lift, and i can disconnect it with one hand. the straps are just the right width. they do not cut or dig into my skin but are not too wide to stick out or sit uncomfortably on my shoulder blades. i do not notice any cutting into my under arms, but it does sit a little higher than i'm used to. the fabric is lined to create support and modesty, but not heavily padded to create shapes that do not occur in nature. the underwires are slightly wider than what i find in everyday-type bras, and this creates a lot more stability in the support i experience.in summary: make sure you're wearing the correct size bra, not what that little old lady told you it was, then give this sports bra a shot if you want great support, great shaping, and comfort. it will take some getting used to but it's worth it. if it didn't look so much like a censor bar i would wear this every. single. day. and if you have a prime account you have no excuse to not try this. if you've read this far then take my advice and just buy it.
166572	i followed the sizing recommendations and was disappointed when this bra turned out to be at least a size too small.  the style seemed nice and might have worked if i ordered a size bigger, but i decided to go back to shock absorber and champion for now.
166583	i've been buying these for years from a rather expensive store.  i'm so glad amazon has them!  these are the absolute best sports bras you can get - especially if you're well endowed.  they hold everything in so well you can do anything, and since they don't give you a uniboob i've actually worn them to work from time to time.  they're more comfortable that my regular bras, so why not?  they run a little smaller than my regular bras so i had to go up a size, but once i found what fit i got a couple more. it's what i wear on every day off and any time i just want to be extra comfortable.
166589	i ordered the 34e. fits well but i still bounce when doing jumping jacks or other aerobics.  not as much as other bras but i still need to wear this with a tank which has a bra included.  i wore it to work under a dress and loved how it lifted the girls, gave me a nice round full look, and did not dig into my shoulders.  so in the end it's versatile...functions as a day bra and functions as a sports bra.
166618	this necklace and pendant is definitely not for men! the necklace and pendant are way to small and very feminine looking. can imagine that this would look great on women, but should not be advertised for men - very misleading. am giving this to my better half for her birthday, so not a complete waste - just disappointed with the false advertising for men.
166640	i got this to go under my lindy bop dresses since it was cheaper than the one they offer. it gave my dress a wonderful fullness. it was a tiny bit big, but ihave bigger hips so i am used to things fitting that way on me. i did not have any problems with itching or scratchy of the mesh.
166653	i would have ordered the next half size up but did not want to take a chance on them not fitting either. they were very stiff and i felt they would hurt my feet. i wish i could try them on first. i did not want to pay for shipping again. they were very well made and attractive. i received the refund in a reasonable amount of time. i would buy from them again.
166758	i already have 2 of these that i use as everyday bras at home. my one issue with this one is the band at the back where the hooks are, there's this rough part at the edge that chafes. of the 3 i have, one didn't have this issue, but one did. though the rough part of that one slowly softened up after numerous hand washings. hoping it happens with this pink one. other than that, it's still uber comfy, great to just wear at home. as this doesn't really have that great a support, i wear other bras for that.
166851	beautiful the only downside is that i asked 3 (three) lenses of these and i received only 2 (two), but they are spectacular. they are beautiful.bellos lo unico malo es que pedi 3(tres) lentes de estos y solo recibi 2 (dos), pero estan espectaculares. son hermosos.

166913	these feel great under my jeans today, cozy and comfy. soft, and not too bulkyi gave a pair as a gift and kept a pair for myself. i will use these repeatedly this winter i expect. probably will work great as boot socks as well. i will hand wash them as i don't want them to pill.
166950	this dress is so pretty. the material is real nice and flowing. it accentuates your body so well. i received lots of compliments and have bought 3 other clothes from this designer.
166961	it is so nice it look so good love it it was an excellent buy. it goes well with a lot of stuff
167015	so i got the black,white, and grey in xl, they looked tight to the body so i wasnt sure how they'd fit and worried they might shrink. i wear a m/l in shirts, so when i got these they fit perfectly. they are form fitting, but not as much as i thought, they still had some loose room to feel comfortable in, i washed them twice since i've had them in the 2 weeks, laundry on weekends..lol. and they didnt shrink, the size is well kept. the shirts are soft, and the v neck is nice, not too low but gives the appearance of some moderate cleavage, which is kinda nice for us smaller chested girls, hahaha. its a really nice t-shirt with jeans kind of style. i'm pretty laid back clothes wise, so i like my t-shirts and jeans, i have worn the white and black shirts with some skirts though, tucked inside the skirt, they still look nice enough to wear like that when going out. i'm 5'4, 138lbs, curvyish. 36b/c, small waist, bigger butt and hips, my arms are sort of athletic-ish, hispanic women are rarely ever stick thin lol so i'm just sayin for you girls out there to get a visual image, since pickin clothes online is sometimes a risk for us hahaha.
167027	i'm not big chested, so this is pretty low cut for me but i guess it doesn't matter since there's nothing there. but this would be very sexy for anyone looking to show a little more, i just enjoy v-necks for the gym, but this one's not too gym appropriate, but perfect for going out. true to size, and fits great, good material as well. 5 stars for me.
167040	too bad, i want to love this shirt and i would if the sizing were right. i wear a large in everything, i ordered an xl based on the reviews and the xl is absolutely skin-tight. it's going back. buyer beware!
167084	i have bought several white v-neck tshirts, even in juniors, but this one fit closer to what i expected. the only thing i do not like about this t shirt is that it is too long for me, i have a shorted torso being 4'11&#34;. the shoulder and fit around bust area were good, the area around the tag puckered a bit so i guess that aspect of clothing being the perfect length for me without having to alter would be difficult to find, but i am still hoping someone out there would manufacture clothing for people of age ( 30 and above not juniors) who are much smaller than a petite person.
167089	i have recently lost some weights and medium was starting to be loose.  this felt almost like a small.  i like the cut, and it fits okay.  the sizing was not what i expected.
167122	nothing like what it said on web it is 8 nose rings and no bone screw just nose rings but for the price it is what it is harder than heck to get them in so small
167191	i simply adore these shoes! they are perfect! i bought some for my mom for mother's day! they like walkin on air....
167195	all the other reviews say it, too, but just to add emphasis: yes, these shoes seriously are comfortable. i won't go so far as to say &#34;like not wearing shoes at all&#34; but they definitely feel like you're walking around almost in slippers, they're that cozy.i was a little worried that maybe the material that they're made out of would make them look a little weird since it seemed to me like the material was similar to what watershoes are made of, if you've ever owned those, but they look fine to me. i'd note that the sizing runs pretty much spot on, too. sometimes i order half a size up just to be safe, and i did so here, but really didn't need to.these are definitely worth the price- i think i might even order the purple ones, too.
167212	will get this in different colors if i can. very comfortable, able to use it the whole day with no pain,  highly recommended, not for wide feet.
167216	"the jocelyn shoes are a wonderful value, and their scalloped styling gives a distinctive look that truly ""pops"" when you put them on your feet.  these are true to size, and the color is just perfect, exactly as shown on the website.  on top of these being good quality, they are comfortable to wear and great looking with the 5"" heel.  you will not go wrong if you purchase these shoes!"
167223	i like the dress a lot, fits good . it definitely hugs your body, but it will get noticed! but the only con was shipping took a long , long, long time !
167265	good item, nice size and construction is consistent with item price and quality. yes i would recommend to a friend.
167271	i returned these!  could see my panties through them!  i wanted them to be a little thicker!  quick and easy return!
167286	tried lots of leggings. these are the best. the wide waistband and texture are great.  they run long which is good for me.
167304	these are the best leggings i have ever owned. they are comfortable, and durable.i wish there was more of a color assortment.
167306	i would give 5 stars for these leggings, which have ended my long search for a high quality product if the size medium wasn't a bit large.  prior to ordering, i carefully read the reviews, especially re sizing and given my 5' 6&#34; 125 pounds i thought a medium would suite me.  these leggings are almost perfect, except a bit too large and a bit too long.  i'm high waisted, so i simply hike them up higher and they fit better.  i'm going to order more in a size small.
167340	great for dance practice and i think they are trendy too.  i'd like to see more colors.  i do love this product, very nice quality.  thanks !!
167365	the rubber it's okay. absorb water and dry very fast. i use for walk around house and cozy at my feet. my complaint just look seem narrow. my foot fit in this sandals. but, seem narrow. my slide sandals used before this, it's really  wide. same size, but, like man size. other than that, i like this product.
167460	my daughter purchased this ring and just loves it! it's just as pictured and looks rich in quality. she is very tempted to buy in other gemstone colors.
167461	i buy just about all my rings from amazon.  i can get affordable rings that sparkle and shine and just look gorgeous.  i have never been disappointed.  the pink in this ring is very rich. i have a very light pink ring, also, and it's nice to be able to switch up based on what i am wearing.  wear it to the grocery store - it just sparkles in that light.  happy, happy customer.  a recommended buy!
167471	love, love, love these sunglasses.  i'm heading to miami and i think they look great for the trip. totally excited
167496	love how big they are.. i  often refer to them as my bumble bee glasses.  fun to wear and stylish. would defiantly over again. wonder if they come in black...
167516	if you are on the fence about this set, do yourself a favor and buy it now! i found this while looking for a new tutu for my daughter's 3rd birthday party. after becoming very annoyed with the number of cheaply made, tacky and very overpriced options i found, i decided to look on amazon. i was thrilled when i found this magical 5 piece set for less than what i expected to pay for the tutu alone. the tutu is well made with a covered satin ribbon waistband and attached flower with a jeweled center. the wings have elastic straps ( similar to a thick hair elastic) that match the color exactly and more importantly, allows my now 3 yr old to easily put them on herself. the body of the wings and the wand are made of a very sheer material ( think thick nylons or tights) that is pretty delicate. after almost a month of daily play, the wings have a few snags and the wand sadly lost it's life during a tantrum yesterday. that being said, the wings still work great and my daughter couldn't care less about the snag. as a previous reviewer complained about, the ribbons on the floral headpiece are basically gift wrap ribbons. this does not detract from the cuteness in any way, or make it look cheap at all. overall i am thrilled with this purchase and am planning to buy another color soon. knowing what's out there, this is worrh it for the tutu alone!
167617	very cute case but my dg glasses will not fit. the case remains half way open. i guess i will lose out on my money because i will not spend $ returning it.
167639	i returned this shirt because it was larger than i expected and too large for me.  i would suggest going down a size when ordering. the small i got seemed more like a medium.  the white color i got was also somewhat translucent.  apart from these flaws it seemed like nice material, with a kind of check pattern texture woven in, and it is a nice looking shirt. i will probably order it again and get a size smaller and a dark, non-translucent color.
167640	i love this lightweight, quality fabric and color saturation. it fit well, as described in the sizing chart. the vertical striping pattern is understated but adds interest to the style.
167647	if you want the look of a turtle nexk without being conventional then this piece is for you. i love it. the fabric is light weight enough not to make you uncomfortable but it is a little shear.
167659	please don't size up! i listened to the reviewers and sized up and they're too big order your normal size and you'll be fine.  i'm between a 8 1/2 and 9.  i'm reordering a 9 because i have a wide foot. i will update when i get the correct size.  they're well made, soft and good quality leather, and i recommend this item, and this brand.
167661	"i'm a snapshot photographer, but my husband used to be a pro photographer and darkroom technician, and his product quality standards are based on that experience. so we (and by ""we"" i mean ""he"") have several cameras... which naturally need to be stored and transported. this camera bag, provided to me through amazon vine, immediately became his favorite.the previous bag-of-preference was acase logic slrc-205 slr camera slingwe bought on a gold box deal, which he liked -- to a point. at $40-50, it's a heck of a lot cheaper than this one. i never did write a review, but it would have gotten a solid 3 stars.i know that if it were i trying to choose a bag (including as a gift for someone else), i'd be wondering if you get 3-4 times the value from the lowepro bag; if this just a vanity purchase?nope. there's several reasons this one is worth the extra money.first, it really is built for larger cameras and the ""stuff"" a serious photographer takes along. hiscanon eos 5d mark iiirests comfortably in the lowepro, along with three lenses, and it slides out effortlessly. with the less expensive bag he was always wrestling to get the camera in and out. that doesn't sound that that big a deal, except that photographers often want to whip out the camera when an opportunity arises; the cute kitty won't stay in that adorable pose for long, after all. (if you have a smaller camera, he points out, the bag size might not be as much of an issue. i suspect his older camera will move into the case logic bag.)the lowepro also has what the company calls ""an innovative flap that effortlessly folds in half to quiet your moves and quicken your pace,"" which sounds like a non-feature... except that it already plastered a big smile on my husband's face. it give the bag a ""transport mode"" (with even-better protection from damage) and a ""use mode,"" with convenience forefront.the entire bag is well balanced and easy to hold. even the pocket organization makes sense. (with the sling bag, he essentially had to find a bench or a flat surface in which to dig around, especially if he had to change lenses. grumbling ensued.)he's thrilled with the lowepro. if you're serious about photography, you probably will be, too."
167682	it said everything i wanted tomsay and she adores it, which is the most important thing.  it is beautiful with the singapore chain.
167693	i bought these for myself shortly after christmas.  i like to wear a plain old t-shirt and comfy bottoms to bed.  i am pretty picky.  i want soft, durable, cute and cotton.  i got everything i wanted with these.also i am 5ft 2in so i usually swim in anything not petite in length.  i bought an xl and i wear a size 14.  these are great, they do not bind or hug too tight. they are cozy but do not make me hot.  so like my subject reads.  i bought a second pair after 3weeks of loving my first pair.  great price and i will probably buy more.  they will work winter through summer.
167703	my wife legs are always cold at night even in the summer so she wears jammies. she wanted something she could step out of the house without looking like she was wearing pajamas and she didn't want anything cutesy.the waist-band is wide -- almost 1.5 inches, the fabric is light-weight (pants weigh a bit less than 1/2 pound), soft and breathable. great for summer.  to retain the elasticity in the waist-band, i air dry the pants.she bought one in each color.
167893	they fit great, are really comfortable, and seem to be really durable.  and i'm pretty skeptical of pajama bottoms, expecting them to fit oddly or be pretty much disposable.  i will definitely order these again if they're still being made when these wear out.
168078	the placement of the arms on the frame causes these to be more alien looking than cat eye. the glasses are strange all around.
168095	i love the size of these glasses.  when they say over-sized, they mean over-sized.  i have a fat face and these look fab.  if you are very small these may be too big.  the only negative is they are flimsy.  like you have to keep them in a hard case or they will break.
168223	it is reversible, what you see is what you get, this one is navy and off white, the reverse is all navy blue.  the hood is detachable which is good because i have always found the hoods to be too big and obstruct my vision. i take it off.i hope the zipper lasts.  last year i had a name brand and the zipper broke the second month of use.i don't think this is a name brand and i spent less money on it. it feels very warm and it has room in case i need a sweater under neath it. it is lined.  the sleeves can be tightened at the wrist but only on the duo color side.
168229	this is true to size. my fiance likes it a lot for outdoor activities in moderate to cool temperatures. stays dry and airy- warm without keeping sweat on the skin.
168261	these are very comfortable and great for pajamas. also wear them under clothes when going out in the cold. holds up well too. can't beat the price. i am 5'4 130 lbs (34&#34; waist, 38&#34; hips) and i ordered a small and they fit perfectly after the initial wash. the length is great too. i have two pairs, one in lavender and one in pink.
168280	many &#34;made in china&#34; shoes i have tried are poorly made and a very sloppy fit. these are more like moccasins and i would have returned them but i opted to use shoe insert pads.
168283	these are comfortable, slip-on shoes that will be great to wear with shorts and skinny jeans.  they fit me well and will be perfect for summer vacations.
168320	face it, one of the target markets (if not the only one) for swim shirts is large guys who don't have beach bodies.  meaning they generally have a belly of some size.  there are plenty of skin-tight &#34;athletic fit&#34; swim shirts out there for the athletic, fit guys with small bellies.  the rest of us look for something like this swim tee.  i got an xxl, and brand new it still fits a bit tighter than most of my xxl tee shirts.  however, that isn't entirely a bad thing because you are wearing it in the water, and baggy would drag you down.  i'm 6'0&#34;, 275 lbs., and the xxl was about maxed out.  if you are taller or bigger than me, i suggest you keep looking.  otherwise, just be realistic about your size, considering that most american retailers are increasing their sizes, and that the sizes from kanu surf are a little conservative.once wet, it does tend to cling to your body as you get out of the water, just like a swimsuit does.  one pull and it releases, and then it generally hangs free and looks good.  i was very happy with it, it let me focus on swimming with my kid instead of worrying about my farmer's tan and size.
168351	these shoes are amazing!  they're like gloves for your feet!  i think someone may have said to watch out because part of the sole is slippery but i have no idea what they're talking about.  they're great!
168355	i have this shoe in 5 colors (purchased at local store when on sale for $40 each). their slip-on nature is easy & comfortable. the shoelaces basically are there for aesthetic appeal & can be removed if you wish. i love that the cushioned insole is removable for washing/freshening up. these are the easiest sneakers to keep clean & in great shape. i wear a size 8 shoe & have a wide foot, but my sneaker size tends to vary depending on brand & style - in these i wear 7.5. they are streamlined yet supportive to the feet - i walk & work in these every day (casual office job) & i use them at the gym for aerobic machines (not running) & am comfortable all day long without the bulky/clunky look of regular athletic sneakers. however, after a long walk of more than 3 hours, my feet will begin to strain & get tired. that's when it's time to go home, kick off my shoes & put my feet up. the navy/white (blue gingham w/lime green trim) is the cutest style pattern of all & actually makes my feet look smaller than they are! love these shoes!
168356	these shoes are awesome, so comfy and true to size. would forsure buy again and again. the soul of the shoe is alittle different. was skeptical when i opened the box but i put them on and away i went! never have owned this comfortable of a shoe. thank you dr. scholls:-)
168362	"my teenage daughter wanted a rose gold watch like the $$ mk watch. having seen the mk watch in person at nordstrom's, this is as close a dup as it comes. not wanting to spend $250 on a designer watch and not wanting a crystal, blinged out watch face, this watch was the choice. it's a very pretty shade of rose gold. not a ""fake pink"" like others we've seen. the watch has a nice weight to it and large face. like the other reviews have stated, it's a boyfriend watch. it's supposed to be big. if your looking for a rose gold boyfriend style watch like the designer watches without all the bling, get this one!"
168389	i'm 5'9&#34; and the legs still bunch a little at my ankles so they're very long which i love.i normally wear a 12/13 in jeans, i ordered xxl in the black ones and they fit perfect. they're very comfortable and have a feel that's very similar to yoga pants just thicker. i definatly recommend these :)
168406	i like the pants, they are very snug and a nice material. i am 5'4 130 lbs and i needed a size large.
168442	these are the cutest shoes and i cannot wait to wear them! i thought the knots would be uncomfortable but when i tried the shoes on (size 9) i had to tighten the strap. can't wait to show these off.
168545	well worth the money. i wanted a pair of studs to wear for every day, and these sparkle like crazy. excellent craftsmanship, very sturdy, and gorgeous to boot. i will probably be getting another pair in the 2 carat size, i love these and wear them all the time.
168572	"my situation is that i'm 5'8"" tall, around 200 lbs., 42d in a bra, and have absolutely no waist.  my hips and thighs are not large, comparatively speaking.  the problem is the spare tire around the midriff.  i am not a young woman, to say the least(!) and so i've always valued comfort.  however, in order to look at least moderately good on a dress-up occasion, i decided to try a shaper.i bought three of them from amazon:  this one, the spanx trust your thinstincts shaping tank 1069,  in a 2xl, for $49.60; the barely there women's second skinnies smoothers scoop neck, in a xx-l, for $13.50; and the self expressions skinny tank (00489), in a 2xl, for $12.60 plus $4.40 shipping.  i should note that i will be wearing a bra under any of these shapers as they are not nearly supportive enough in that area.the spanx is very light, much more so than the self expressions skinny tank, and would probably be cooler on hot day.  but it didn't firm me enough.  perhaps i should have gone down a size, but i compared my measurements with the spanx size chart, and 2xl was what was indicated.  the barely there woman's camisole is just that -- more of a camisole with very little holding in power, except around the bust, where it was a bit tight.  it was heavier than the spanx, and just a smidge lighter than the self expressions, which is probably the heaviest (and the best).all in all, although the spanx was nice and light, and did help, the self expressions skinny tank, reviewed elsewhere, was the best for what i needed.  it was also much cheaper than this one!"
168581	i am a wacoal lady. only buy wacoals because they last and are made so well. this bra is very nice and love the way it fits. you can find a matching panty here on amazon and they are so nice. i love this as a set. the color is so pleasing. i want to say it pushes up but it isn't designed like the advertised push up bras with a filler to help push them up. it pulls you in nicely to give you theright amount of cleavage but not giving you the bimbo look, if that makes any sense?
168584	this was my first wacoal ourchase but it will not be my last. i am very pleased with the quality and comfort of the bra and will bepurchasing more.
168592	i have been looking for something with side support and finally found this.  not too expensive.  the lace is a little noticeable under a tee shirt but not bad.  i would definitely recommend it.
168629	the fabric is smooth and comfortable, with enough stretch to hold in what needs to be held without making it hard to breathe! ;-) it's plain white, which is nice if you want to wear it under a light colored shirt. lots of compression shirts have crazy designs or logos all over them, under armour is famous for that. when i'm at church in a white shirt i don't want an under armour logo showing through.
168677	the shells on my necklace are a little darker (or more colored) than in the picture but very pretty.  the freshwater pearls are nice quality.  necklace adds real pop of color to a white blouse.  only drawback for me is wish was long enough to wrap three times since hangs little long for my taste at two wraps but did not take off another star for that since it will probably be fine when i wear it with a shirt with a color on it.
168705	i keep these in my truck. they are highly effective, light and comfortable. i highly recommend them for anyone's use.
168799	i got this robe because i swim in an outdoor heated pool and i want to keep swimming in the winter (it gets very cold where i live). i prefer the feel of a towel-like robe rather than a swim parka, but there aren't a lot of athletic-looking choices out there. i think this robe is more of a lounging or post-bath robe for home or spa. it is very plush and roomy, and therefore very cozy and warm. for my purposes, it works (i surely appreciate the warmth and plushness when i come out of the pool on a cold day). however, i would prefer a more sporty look (maybe a more streamlined robe, not as roomy--i do look like i'm swimming in fabric) and perhaps other color choices besides white. also, it's very bulky and so it's hard to fold and fit into my gym bag... i have to carry it in my hands. i am 5'3&#34;, 106 lbs and got the s/m.
168806	these are super cute, but please order a size (or 2??) bigger than you need.  i ordered a medium and they barely cover my butt.  i am keeping them but please be forewarned!
168811	i just received these and they look very nice... i washed and dryed them and they still look good, i wore a pair today and the seem very comfortable and dont ride up i would reccomend these as of right now, you get 12 pair of panties for 20 bucks great value and they are good quality, cotton and spandex they are soft and comfortable and pretty to top it off very nice color assortment including neutral and white, true to size i got the med. and i wear a 6/7 normaly and weigh 125lbs. hope this was helpful...
168846	this is a very stylish and nice looking sweater.  it is just as professional looking and attractive as i'd hoped.
168849	this was my first time ordering from patty. i love the top. it fits comfortably and is a beautiful color. i ordered the red one.  it came in beautifully wrapped and i even received a follow up e mail from patty regarding the delivery and the package.i would definitely recommend patty and shop again :)my new favorite :)
168856	like the low cut of this sweater. i wear at least 4x's a month in the winter. it's sexy for dinner w/your man.
168858	i recently bought 10-15 patty items, after reading all the positive reviews here. her shirts/sweaters fit so unbelievably well. i feel like they are made for my body type. i am 5'10, 145 pounds and busty (34ddd/36dd, 29&#34; waist, 39&#34; hips). all of the tops are stretchy in the bust and fitted in the waist, but not tight (they hide a little belly). they are so flattering. also, the sleeves on the long sleeve shirts are all really long. i can never find tops that fit my longer arms! i find that i usually do not need to order the &#34;chest size&#34; in patty, as that would put me in a large and i have a smaller waist. the mediums for the most part fit great (i have a few of the tighter shirts in large).this is a lightweight sweater that fits true to size (i bought a medium). it is a little low cut but looks great with a tank under it for daytime (at night, i think the cleavage amount would be ok). very soft and warm. i love it! i ordered both colors!!
168886	this ring is even prettier in person.  it is just lovely and came in a pretty box.  it was a gift for my boyfriends daughter for graduation.  it is her birthstone and we just love it!
168893	the stone is a wonderful deep pink. i really love the style of this ring, its pretty but not too flashy..
168906	i purchased this bead for my sister for her birthday. it arrived quickly and was as described- a nice addition
168918	i really liked this shirt. the size was right, nice color, the only issue is that you have to hand wash it because it is a delicate knit. i recommend this purchase though.
168940	i just discovered pattyboutik clothing a couple weeks ago and i absolutely love it! this is coming from a person who hates shopping for clothes!
168942	i tried it...didn't like it.gave it to my more...she didn't like it. now i spend $20 on a useless piece of clothing...oh wellit shows a lot of clevage. busty girls bewarenormally i love their designs...but not this one
168954	another great work shirt from patty. it may a little long, but it looks fabulous and it's true to size, which i was a little worried about when i read another couple of reviews about patty's boutique. this is a great shirt and i can layer it and wear it to work.
168972	i'm leaving 4 stars because i found the top absolutely beautiful - loved the turquoise color and loved the soft feel, plus how unique it looked. however, my chest must be higher than average or something . i have that problem with other products, such as summer dresses, where i have to alter the straps to make them shorter, since my chest to shoulder proportion seems to be shorter. this was the case with this product, the straps were just too long and it did not look good on me, so i ended up returning it.
169032	i absolutely love this nightgown! i want the other styles of this gown! i highly recommend this product to anyone
169033	i was looking for a thicker warmer gown. when this product arrived, i was unpleasantly surprised to see that it was very thin, thinner than a hankerchief. i kept it to wear in hotter temperatures, but was disappointed.
169061	i am so glad that i don't have to buy two different cleaners anymore.  i have gold and sterling silver jewelry and both have diamonds and or semi precious stones.  it was a pain having to use different cleaners based on the metal.  now i can just drop it in this cleaner and i don't have to worry about it.
169233	this is a show piece.  be warned, the hello kitty face on this necklace is blingy.  just what my high school afficienado wanted.  the chain is sturdy and the necklace is adorable.
169334	this looked great on me, and was very flattering around my curves.  i really love it- i think it's going to be one of my favorite shirts.  the downside is that it's expensive!  and the stitching looks a bit fragile.  i wouldn't run it through the washer at all- handle with care.  but it sure looks good.
169348	i love this shirt and the style so much i bought it in 3 colors! it's fit's to size perfectly and makes me feel so pretty and unique. i always get compliments when i wear these blouses. i highly recommend them to anyone.
169393	i really like these bra's i have ordered them in two size's and several colors now, first i normally wear a 40 dd or 42 dd i first ordered a 40 dd i thought i really liked but after really looking i think was two tight so returned with no problams and got the 42 dd it fit much better, racer back bra's for larger women are hard to find and i think this does the job with comfort and style, holds up well and very comfy looks good under tight tanks and i have had no problams with the clasps or straps they seem to stay up fine. there is a little bit of padding but over all i have ordered several racer back and other bra's off amazon in the last month and this is my favorite in the racer back style. i ended up getting black and tan and happy with both, i would buy again. and at the price even if they don't hold up forever you can get more but i do think they will hold up well the wire's are well covered and don't seem like they will poke out. clasp seems sturdy and is made like all the other front close bra's i have gotten so should be fine. i would recomend it
169426	i'm very pleased with this purchase. i usually buy vs items, but the quality and fit on this one are comparable (though no one beats vs for sexy, in my opinion, you certainly pay for it). so for a &#34;practical&#34; bra, this is perfect! i love having the front closure.
169491	these beautiful ear rings look great on my daughter and also on my wife. they are not too big and gaudy, but rather just the right size. the heart cut is especially nice and the quality of the product seems to be sturdy - of note: these are made in the u.s.a. - how many jewelry companies can say that!? five stars for beauty, quality, durability, and being made in the u.s.a.
169501	great sandals for the coming summer. i owe many other steve madden wedges and these are just as beautiful and well made as all the others. i have them in coral and they're not as bright as the picture, more like a toned down coral but still very pretty, they are sure to go with all my summer dresses. i love the strap on these, very comfortable material, not rough at all. if you're not used to walking in higher wedges, these will still be great for you as they don't fell high at all and are super comfortable. very happy with these, cant wait until the hot texas summer to finally get to wear these out.
169509	the main gem on the sandal fell out the second time i wore them. it was really too bad because the shoes are very cute and very comfortable. but for that amount of money, they really should be made better.
169553	i must admit, the picture was misleading! i thought it would be all pink, but it's pink/white plaid. even so, i really like them! super cute!
169585	i'm trapped in the 40's so this dress and it's counterpart are perfect for the look i was going for! i can't begin to say how delighted i was to find them and the matching does to complete my outfit! the dress breathes beautifully and moves like a dream! no matter what your plans for the day or night are, this is a stunning, classy and fun dress for the event!
169595	these are a pretty good set of socks if you are looking for non-skid, warm fuzzy socks.  the rubber non-skid surface is sufficient, but could be a bit more tacky or &#34;sticky&#34; to increase friction and further reduce skid.  i bought these to wear at home up and down slick hardwood stairs carrying my baby, and so far, they are effective, and they are very warm too!
169632	bought these for my girlfirend, and she loves them. she says they are a little big, but not so much that she cant wear them. she says they are very comfortable and hold up well even on our long bike rides.
169696	so happy that bali started making the lace & smooth body briefer again!! i love it- fits well, not too tight, very supportive, lace isn't at all scratchy & entire briefer washes perfectly in the washing machine - no hand washing.  shapes breasts nicely (not too pointy and not  &#34;uni-boob&#34; like some shapers), holds gut in and gives my back support too.  love this thing!!!
169720	the quality of the product was great however the size was deceptive.  i ordered to accommodate my bust size but it could not fit at the hip.
169722	this is not a shaper per se is more of a smoother. it just gets rid of panty and bra lines. the bra fits true to size and the snaps at the crotch are easy to secure and not uncomfortable. i wear one nearly every day and while it does not take a size away or anything like that is just smooths you out. i have 2 black and one rose. love them!
169745	as all you ladies know, it is better to try it on first! in my case, it fits prefect, i am 5'5&#34; and long-waisted, i don't like under-wire cups, but these fit well, and i must say looks very pretty.
169852	it runs small.  i usually wear a medium (bust 36) but this large was very snug on me.  and i had to look at the fabric contact because it felt like wool. it's kind of rough feeling fabric and not much stretch.  it is polly.  i like the look but i have to wear something under it to hid my bra straps...i ended up just pinning the black part to the plaid part and that works.  it is cut pretty low and can show your bra so have a nice lace cami or something else to help that out.  i have not washed it.  polly doesn't usually shrink.  let's hope the label is correct.
169868	being a somewhat vertically challenged person (5' 1-1/2&#34;) and not heavy (103 lbs), i find these pants to be nearly perfect. no big deal -i have to hem everything anyway.  i'm pushing 70 years old so i have a flat butt and not a flat gut. heaven forbid a woman my age wear leggings!  an xs might fit through the waist/hips/thighs better but i would be concerned they would sit too low on my hips, so i buy a small.  i've been wearing danskin products for years and years and i like the comfort and durability.  they wash, dry, pack beautifully.  i would wear these pants exclusively if i could get away with it.
169869	i ordered these because i wanted a straight leg. the legs are indeed straight but very wide. i have other danskin products in the same size (m) but these have just too much fabric. i'm an average size (5'5&#34; tall, 130 lbs.) and the pants are at least 3&#34; too long so i'll have to cut off and hem. i will keep them only because i like the quality of the fabric and think it will hold up after many washings.
169878	wow, what a wonderful little change purse.  it is very soft and lovely leather, beautiful color (i ordered navy blue) and seems to be excellent quality workmanship (i just received it today).  exactly what i wanted and i'm very satisfied.  it even has two pockets!
169886	i really like them. they fit with my summer wardrobe which right now consists of cruddy clothes. at least i have somewhere to start.
169927	don't need a lot of it, and it shines very nicely.  if you want high gloss, just buff the shoes longer.
169970	i've had the ring less than a week and already have so many compliments. it arrived a day before they said and in perfect condition. thank you.
169975	can't wait till spring, i'm in las vegas it's hot then, to wear this when i take my walks.  fits very nicely and looks wonderful.
170074	i bought these just before going on vacation in eastern canada. the first day i put them on, the wallet pocket wore through within the first hour! i didn't lose the wallet. i haven't worn them since then!
170079	this is one of the most beautiful watches i have ever owned. the quality is outstanding. perfect size! don't miss this one!
170101	i bought these for christmas gifts for my co-workers at the office and everyone said how they loved them and how warm they are.  very good quality and great price.
170200	ordered a large. i'm 5'9 and 170 pounds and they fit perfectly but i'm not curvy so i don't see a problem with them staying up on me. they're light weight and a bit revealing but offset by the flared leg at the bottom. a slim woman could wear these and look terrific but so can a not so slim one. fast shipping a very happy with them. i'd recommend buying a pair especially for the price!
170307	a little snug, not as i expected. adjusting straps didn't really help still a tight fit; other wise for ano underwire not bad.
170308	now here we are - the best bra i've found to date.  i don't even notice i'm wearing it, the whole article is comfortable, even the straps!
170441	it isn't real bronze. it's costume jewelry. (for anyone wondering) the owl is pretty large, taking up most of my hand when i lay it flat in my palm. since i have a chest tattoo, i prefer my necklaces shorter. this necklace was way too long. however it was very easy to shorten to the perfect length. it definitely has that vintage/antique look that i love. i love it and i got a lot of compliments when i wore it out the other night.
170508	broke after 1 time of wearing. i bought another and it did the same thing. very low quality! now worth it!
170591	this necklace is really cute. it's really good quality and it's pretty big and grabs attention. i got a few compliments from friends. it's such a great price and free shipping! it also arrived sooner than expected which was really nice.
170639	always a good brand never fades fits perfect last forever quality sewing will not shrink i love them forever and ever
170649	i bought these panties after reading several positive amazon reviews. they are non-binding and light as a feather. i have big upper legs and these panties are good for my body type. one drawback would be that thin panty liners don't stick well to the material. the trade off is overall comfort. i ordered more in black. wash perfectly.
170650	i know it said high cut but it gave them a weird shape,more triangular & not wide enough for me in the crotch area so i returned them. they were good quality & i am sure if they are your thing then you would love them..they just weren't for me.
170680	very nice material, and i'll definitely be ordering more of these. color is true to what i saw on my screen. sleeves fit great and i'm happy with the shrug. it was very carefully packaged in the box to make sure it wasn't damaged.my only gripe with this is about the ordering process - the delivery date was scheduled for way too long. i received my item before the projected delivery date, but was concerned because i needed it by a certain date. when it shipped, for several days the tracking number produced no results/updates. the seller responded quickly to my emails about it, but it was still frustrating that the info wasn't updated until the day of delivery. there wasn't an option for expedited shipping, which i would have gladly paid to make sure my product arrived by the required date.my suggestion to the seller would be to quote more accurate shipping/delivery timeframes to prevent confusion.
170715	this was a good value. i have worn it over a few dresses to cocktail parties where it's dark. it's not for formal occasions, but is otherwise fine.
170738	i enjoyed these pumps by aerosoles.  they are comfortable and also in leather.  i got the brown which was a gorgeous.  the heel was a good height for walking.  i saw these on qvc at a much higher price.  don't hesitate to buy.
170754	"years ago one of my jobs involved designing various pieces of sporting equipment, including bags - so i know what details to look for.the designers of this bag really thought of everything.  when i opened the flap, i immediately noticed the waterproof lining.  it's a separate, heavy duty, sewn-in sheet - not a coating or laminate that will crumble or fall apart after a couple of years. edges are trimmed and double-stitched. seams are double-stitched. the carrying handle feels like it is stuffed with gel. there are two steel d-rings, plus other attachment points.  while many manufacturers simply cut and burn the nylon webbing, this bag goes further. each strap end is folded (sometimes twice) and then sewn again. no sharp ends here!the shoulder strap is not removable, but it is adjustable, with a unique buckle system. the pad is a little stiff and will need to be broken-in. there's also a pair of tripod loops on the bottom to hold a small or medium tripod. all attachment points and straps are double sewn and ""x"" stitched. can't see them pulling free.as for the inside: under the flap are four narrow slots, three of which are zippered. great for paperwork, manuals, etc. the padded camera area in under another zippered cover (i would trust this thing in a storm) - and is this horrible baby blue color. it's also removable - a bag in a bag. it's micro-fiber lined and includes four dividers - two large/full height, and two smaller, half height. if you have extra dividers from other bags or cases, chances are they'll work - as long as they use velcro. or generic velcro.quality: fantasticsize: larger than i expectedfeatures: i'm still finding more each time i use the bag!followup 5-20-2012: spent the day with this bag, hiking around and on a couple of quick shoots.  i had my canon f 2.8 70-700, 17-85, 60mm, 70mm, sigma 8mm, canon 7d, garmin gps (use for geotagging), batteries and assorted extras. it was pretty heavy.  the bag tends to travel behind you, not ride on your hip. that's fine. the padded shoulder strap that i thought would be too stiff was actually perfect.  i climbed the stairs at swallow cliffs in cook county (126 oversized steps) up and down, three times - in 92 degree weather. the bag never got too heavy. i did have some chaffing on my neck from the padded strap, but moving it more on my shoulder solved this - and the strap stayed put. overall i was impressed.  i also found that the design is perfect for traveling with in the car - the strap wraps around the head rest on my passenger seat, and the bag rests on the seat. i can use the bag while in the car, but slamming on the brakes won't send my gear strewing about the car."
170758	i have not seen anything like this in the states. this hoodie is a def must have, i bought 2 of them. one in white and the other in black. i got an asian xl.  my chest is 40-42inches, my biceps are 16inches and i have a 32inch waist. i'm 5'9 170lbs. this hoodie hugs me, i absolutely love it!
170782	scarves have nice brilliant colors and a good amount of razzle-dazzle.  the material is a little thinner than i expected and doesn't seem to be the highest quality, however, i think most people will be happy with these scarves.
170805	these sandals were tight, stiff and very uncomfortable. in my opinion and i am probably wrong because i am not sure of what licensed by birkenstock means, but to me it means another company made the shoe, i don't know who designed it, because i like the look/design and price. however, they were very, very uncomfortable and see now why they were less expensive. not a true birkenstock, in my personal opinion. i returned them and ordered another pair of birkenstock/licensed by birkenstock...did not have any other affiliate other than the real birkenstock. the real deal is worth the extra price and comfort.
170825	the lace at the bottom of this bra rolls up and is very uncomfortable.  i ordered up in size and it was still a little small.
170833	i bought these in a bigger size cause i'm pregnant. they fit fine, just a tad small. i love the fabric and the lace. the one thing i hate is the rubber that makes this panty &#34;no slip&#34;. geat idea, but it's around the waist and around each leg hole. the rubber around the leg hole is uncomfortable.
170901	if you read my title you will know that i love this watch! i think i spent $20.00 on this watch and it is really pretty and it is able to take a licking. i have been wearing it daily and it stands up to the wear and tear of the day as well as the more exppensive wathces i own. i will purchase again.
170907	band size seems to run a bit small as i feel it is a little tight. no other complaints though. will still try this out and hope it loosens over time.
170930	super comfortable and easy to walk in..i'm used to tennis shoes and wasn't sure how i'd do with the lift...these actually make my posture better and seem to help my sciatic nerve problem..the only thing i don't care for is the plastic slide that fastens the back strap..and a little hard to regulate tightness...overall a good shoe .. i usually wear a 9 1/2 and had to order these in a 10 as they don't have half sizes available...fit very well and am happy i didn't go with a 9
170939	i bought these to wear around the house as an alternative to my frumpy slippers. they are super comfy, and i love putting them on when i get home and my feet are tired.  in addition to wearing them around the house, they are perfect for gardening and running errands.  i loved mine so much that i bought a pair for my mother as a gift.  mom loves them too, they are perfect for her high arches and provide good support.  i would recommend these to anyone who is on their feet all day, or that wants a  cute supportive shoe for around the house.
170948	bought these for my daughter. the quality is about what i expected for the cheap price. they stay up. but the stripes bleed a little in the wash (not terribly, just a bit of a blurry line at the edges, if that makes sense). i would purchase again. good deal for the spunky teen closet!
170959	this is probably my favorite pair of knee highs now! i love the colors!!! they are even more bright and beautiful than in the picture! i would recommend this to anyone!
170971	"i tend to buy t-shirts that are 100% cotton and that are a thicker fabric.  so, this isn't my usual fabric or style.  also, the threaded seams that bracket the shoulders on the front and back that are shown very clearly in the product photos here aren't a style that i'm used to wearing (i'm used to the single seam that runs from the neckline to the sleeve along the top of the shoulder).  all of that said, i find this t-shirt incredibly comfortable and like wearing it.  it's very soft and a bit stretchy, so it fits comfortably.  the thinner fabric drapes more closely over my top than my usual t-shirts, so it does make me wish that i was in better shape, though.  :)  i own a lot of heather grey tee shirts, and this one was a bit darker than the norm, but still a nice color.regarding my comment about it being a bargain, let me say that i don't generally buy ""performance"" tees...so maybe $30 is a good price.  most of my t-shirts cost about $10 and still last me several years, but i don't use them for highly athletic activities.so, a nice shirt, but not worth $30 to the casual wearer, imo.  i may not recommend it based on my usage and style preferences, but i can't knock the construction quality.  it's a well-made shirt."
170979	i own this shirt in 3 colors and, other than the color, they are all exactly the same.i'd call the fit &#34;generous&#34;.  it's not one of those tight &#34;muscle shirts&#34;, but it is very lightweight and roomy.  i'd call the large version true to size.  the neckline comes up pretty high, which is a look that i prefer versus the sloppy, looser collars.the quality looks to be quite high.  the stitching work is actually pretty impressive.  it's no lie when they say that wearing this shirt is almost like wearing no shirt at all.whether you're running, working out, kicking it in jeans, or hanging around the house in sweatpants and a t-shirt (which is what i'm doing right now), this is a nice quality, good looking and comfortable short.  highly recommended!  5 stars.
171010	"i always wash items of clothing before wearing. the appearance of this shirt out of the bag was very fine and soft. here is my major problem with this shirt ordered for my husband: you cannot wash it with all of your other dark stuff because it must be dried on very low heat, not normal heat. while the color and styling are very appealing and of course bamboo is the ""in"" natural material, it is essentially a plant fiber akin the rayon which always was a difficult fabric to manage.  the hang tag advises that the shirt was designed in new orleans, is comfortable, moisture wicking, breathable, anti-odor, upf 50+, 4-way stretch and light weight. it is all of the above i'm sure, but presents a general laundry problem unless you are ok with washing the shirt separately and drying it on very low heat as instructed."
171129	purchased these shoes for my husband and his size 12 was way to large. i had ordered a size for myself and my size (women's)  fit perfect. great shoe light weight but the men's size was out of whack.disappointed and will be sending back.
171131	these are great, extremely warm and make a good indoor outdoor shoe. they are slightly  large. i ordered a 12 and these feel more like a 12.5. these have great traction as long as the soles aren't wet.
171163	i do not like this shoe that much, but it is warm to me, whatever , i  wear this shoe when it is cold.
171176	"first of all, this bandana should be in the clothing category, not the toy category, so the questions amazon asks reviewers to answer do not apply.this bandana stands up to washing very well. i haven't dried it in the drier because if you hang it to dry, it will ""iron"" itself. i use it as a sweat band when working outside, and it's the right size for tying around your head, and i don't have sweat dripping in my eyes anymore.the colors and design are very nice, but unfortunately, they are just printed on one side. and i do think the price is too high, mainly because of that. i don't give a hoot that it's a grateful dead product (the likely reason for the price). i just wanted a bandana that was 100% cotton and not one of those very cheap ones that don't absorb sweat and don't launder well. so for those reasons, if i needed more bandanas, i would probably buy another one of these. but i wish it wasn't just printed on one side, but rather with the design woven in."
171211	this item is just as described and pictured. it smells good and comes in a nice gab. i recommend the item if you are looking for a mala necklace. great price! i look all over for a good item and a great price, this was it.
171222	just received these sandals this week and truly loved them!  not only are they really comfortable for someone with very flat feet who also pronates, but they also fit snugly so they don't flip and flop like thong sandals normally do.  and they are pretty, too!  and, i got them at a discounted price -- how lucky can a girl get?  i plan to purchase them in other colors when they become available.
171227	so far i've only worn them once. i'll admit that the packaging threw me off (it looked a little cheap).once i got them on, though, they were perfect. warm and not risque or anything, which i was nervous about because patterned tights can look like that at times and i wanted these for work.definitely a smart buy. i bought the same pair in purple so i'll let you know how those are. too.
171236	no biggie, just o.k.  bought these for christmas gift. i though they would be a little larger and they're kind of thin.
171252	i saw these on a lightning deal and i thought i would give them a try.  sometimes it's hard to tell the size of these teardrop earrings - personally, i thought they were the perfect size, about twice the length of a thumbnail.  not too big, just right.  well made - i love them on.
171262	the cap looks just like the picture and is lightweight.  i have not worn it yet, but i tried it on and it fits well.
171307	this shirt is so pretty and made of really nice material. it fits me perfect. i orginally ordered in black, but i'm going to order it in another color because i liked it so much.
171313	i have no complaint about these socks. it's me. i cannot stand any feeling of pressure on my toes. these socks are both warm and thin enough to fit into shoes. the red chili pepper color, the pattern, and the three &#34;buttons&#34; up the side are very nice looking. i wear a size 10 women's medium width. i think that's about a size 9 for men's. the socks are the large size. i suppose that most people would think they fit perfectly -- snug, no wrinkles, no empty spots. perhaps i cannot stand any stretch in socks. not the socks' fault.
171326	took one look at  this u plunge body suit with the plastic shoulder straps was impossible to try to figure out how to put it on.  i just didn't have the time to figure it out; and did not bother with it.  i didn't need anyway. returned for refund. well made garment, good price.
171403	i have had no problem with this bra at all, i find it  not to be that heavy and i ordered a b. i have washed in the washer multiple times and just let it air dry with no problems what so ever.
171407	i was looking for a light, attractive push up bra.  nothing too extreme.  this is well priced and fits true to size, but the water pads are heavy.  the bra has to be adjusted just right or the fit will be very off, due to the weight of the water pads.  it also adds weight to you shoulders, with thin straps.  the bra is attractive and fits well, but i don't think water pads are a very good idea.  we don't need added weight, certainly not weight which pulls your shape down.
171424	i need to buy more of these.  i've never seen this color of liquid silver in a tight before.  they also can be worn inside out and they are a gun metal silver if you want to tone down the silver.  i'm protecting these because i want them to last!!!
171461	...for me, at least.  the cap is well-made and the &#34;bling&#34; on the side is not overpowering at all; it just gives the cap a little sparkle (and doesn't look like cheap glued-on rhinestones).  however, like some other reviews cited, the cap is a little snug and i have a smaller head.  even with the elastic portion built in to the band, it's still a little snug.  i certainly couldn't have worn it to an event lasting a few hours.  i had to return it for that reason only.
171543	i bought this shirt in black, size large. (i'm 5'7, about 140lbs). it's one of my most favorite tops! it's super soft, the crochet is sturdy (i've had it a few months and so far no rips, even though the crochet is thin--and i wash in the machine too!) it fits really well, and looks good with a black racerback bra. there are a lot of crochet-back designs out there, but this one is by far the most beautiful in my opinion.
171619	the product is great and a fair price.  my daughter loves them and they are wearing well.  but, they didn't ship to alaska which was very inconvenient and even shipping to a friend in wa was expensive.  my friend put all 3 prs i ordered into a flat rate shipping box to ship here without issue.  love the product but would not order from seller again due to limited shipping options.
171622	these are very cute, fit true to size and even though they are not leather, they disclosed this upfront, they are super cute and very comfy.
171634	i really like the shoes - like everyone else says they're a bit stiff but worth it. . . .
171637	i love the color of the issues and how they fit! except after a few months the bottom was very slippery i can't part with the shoes though even though the fabric on the toe is ripping up maybe it's time i buy another pair definitely worth the money to spend very comfortable as well true to the picture!! only thing to look out for is how tight you tie the shoes as the holes will stretch..worth the money, very stylish, get more than one pair!
171650	i bought these shoes for my daughter at christmas, and then decided i needed a couple pairs myself!! i got the brown and turquoise. they are both very comfortable, and i can't wait to wear them!!!
171651	love the combination of silver beads with brown shoe. beads are a fun addition to the shoes.  shoes are comfortable and pretty.
171706	i love these kinds of tops. so glad to find on amazon. fits and looks great on me. i'm 5'6 180lbs but smaller on top than bottom. large was too big so i returned it and got a medium. medium looks and fit much better on me. ordered a few more of these tops after that. getting ready for the warm weather early.
171710	i love this top.  the fabric is stretchy and light, yet holds up well when laundered.the tube top is a little small for me...i have ginormous boobs, so i would expect that.  the back shows a lot, so at my age i prefer a much longer tube top to hide my mileage.very cute.  so inexpensive for the quality!  arrived much faster than anticipated.
171754	i ordered this is red the first time and now i ordered the gray. i own about 10 patty tops now and i thought i should mention this is the only one that is not skin tight in the mid section. it has some scrunch room and is super fun and cute to wear! i wear a size 8 normally - i am petite too-but in most patty tops ive been ordering xl's due to the nylon type fabrics used. otherwise they are skin tight in the middle-which i do not like. however- this top i have a l in and it is great- hopefully this helps someone who has sizing concerns. id only go one size up in this one because there is a lot of fabric used. it is a rockin top- you will love it! ill order the black one soon too i bet! :-)
171817	i am glad i bought this ring. it reminds me of the love of jesus. the cross is fairly small but not so much it does not get noticed. my ring is a size 7 and i wear it mostly on my right ring finger. it is very girly:)
171842	i am very happy with my boot purchase, since the look and style fits perfectly with some skinny jeans. the only problem i have with these boots is the top of the boot is meant for people with very large calves. otherwise, the boot seems to be holding up, is great for rainy days, and very cute look!
171881	i love this coat, it is a little snug in the upper arm area, but i think i need to lose weight there anyway!  lol!  does anyone else have flabby upper arms?  this coat is so beautiful, i feel like a film star in it.  it keeps me warm and cozy and keeps out the cold and the wind.  this coat is so gorgeous.  thank you so much, luxury lane!
171898	"an absolutely outstanding bargain, but the coat is very heavy.  it weighs 5 pounds, which doesn't sound like much, but it would be a chore lugging it around, or sitting in an airplane with it.  i'd be scared it would get stolen if i took it off while dancing and wasn't watching it all the time.it is reversible, so it has four pockets.  buttons on both sides, which overlap, so no wind would get in.the non-fur outside has abour 4"" fur cuffs, which looks great.  no hemming of cuffs for me.  i'm 5'2, and the size medium came to my ankles.  the hood is big -- if i put it all the way on, it could cover my face.  it's not fitted at all, so it would fit many size bodies.not sure i'm keeping it, as i live in south texas and would only use it occasionally, but it's so elegant and inexpensive.  decisions, decisions..........."
171909	the seiko 5 automatic watch is a great value, costing well less than $100.  i was cautious about buying this watch when i read reviews questioning the water resistance depth, or whether you could even wear this watch in the shower.  see below for additional updates.it is stylish and canvas strap definitely makes this watch different from others i own.  for the money you can't go wrong with this watch.update - august 2012after a summer with this watch, wearing it several times a week, in the shower and while swimming i am pleased that all signs point to my owning this watch for a long time.  you should have no worries about the water resistance or durability of this watch.
171953	the price was good, the fit was great and the color is lovely.  nice addition to my party collection.  recommend
172013	these are my kicks! i wear them every summer with pretty much everything, button down tops and/or tees, shorts and jeans. they are classic. i always get a men's 7 i am a ladies 9 and they fit well. i do insert insoles for support as these guys are flat as flat can. shipping took longer than i would have liked. about a full week and a couple of days.
172197	i wear bandanas in heat & love these... they look very good on & are extremely cheap for a dozen..will buy again..
172205	cried putting this in. cried even more taking it out. haven't won it since then because it gave me a nose injury and caused a scar. i'll advise you to get something a little bit more loose. it does look real though.
172215	i actually used these boas to make a feather skirt and they worked very well. there was shedding of course, but i expected it so it didn't bother me too much. the skirt was hot.
172221	i ordered this at the same time i ordered a similar nose screw made of white gold and having a real diamond stone. i returned the white gold one and kept this one! the stone is just the right size and the screw was easy to get in. i would definitely like to get a very high quality real gold and diamond screw but this nice little ring will keep me satisfied until i find a reputable dealer. i'm very happy for what it cost. the stone is shiny but you can tell it's not a diamond- because it's not one- but this is still a great piece.
172268	"well-matched pearls - really white (despite description of ""cream"") with good luster and undetectable ""slight"" blemishes; very nice ""grape cluster"" shape; very full with no significant gaps between pearls. the silver ""finials"" in each pearl add just the right amount of sparkle. arrived in an acceptable red gift box with red rose bow. very satisfied."
172306	the socks fit very tight. i am 5'2&#34; with fairly skinny legs, but these felt like they might cut off my circulation! they are not nearly as stretchy as i would like. the seam on them is also very noticeable looking down at them, though when looking in a mirror it is not visible. produce the desired effect, but not comfortable or well made.
172314	i waited for these patiently , as they were part of a costume. i ended up buying a different brand and paying extra to have them expedited.  the manufacturer said they were shipped.  they were posted as &#34;shipped&#34;, but i had no socks!
172327	these socks are kinda tight ( im a size 1) but they are very cute and i could work with them i wore them to a metal concert and im very happy that they survived that without any damage i absolutely love them
172336	made of good quality. size is very true. i hope this keeps your backpack. looks stylish. i recommend buying this item.
172339	i bought this to keep me motivated to go back to school this fall. it is perfect! the size, compartments, and the leather is beautiful! would buy it again.
172392	after reviewing many comments, i suspected that this sandal did not run true to size.  i bought 1/2 size up and it!s a perfect fit.  light weight.  this is sexy sandal for light, casual wear, not a work shoe (based on the single strap).  i do suspect it will wear down with extended wear.  thong should fit comfortably with correct size.  i will update.  still waiting on the price of the red to come down ;(
172408	considering there are no cups and wires, this bra totally met my expectations. love it. as long as you have realistic expectations and are not expecting it to take the place of a sexy push up bra, you will be happy. it is a super comfy bra
172421	i purchased this t-shirt for my son for christmas. he absolutely loved it. perfect for his personality. the t-shirt is of great quality. i highly recommend it.
172427	i bought this prouct as they were listed on amazon whose products i trust. they are very comfortable and help keep my swollen ankles under control. the polyester really feels good. i think these dress socks are very fairly priced. i would recommend this product.
172429	the socks are thin and are not of great quality.  i stretched one out of shape by just putting it on one time.  i have a normal foot size and that hasn't happened before.  it only happened with the one sock and the rest were fine.
172432	the shirt was so popular with my grandson that he opened the package and put it on immediately.  has hardly changed out of the t shirt.  glad this minecraft item was available. minecraft is very popular with kids of nine, ten, and older.
172528	this is one of the best fitting and most comfortable bras that i have ever purchased. i bought the front closure because i have fibromyalgia and it's easy to put on and take off. i love the fit so much that i bought three others in different colors!
172550	i had great hopes for this tank top as i have several similar ones from a few years ago.  unfortunately, these are extremely long.  i am 5'9&#34; and the bottom of this tank comes down to the top of my thighs.  hard to tuck in and keep from rolling.
172571	i have a bald spot that covers my entire head. when i run for long distance the sweat pours down my face and into my eyes. head bands some times slip or are too tight. this is just right fits well and lets your head breathe thick band not too tight or uncomfortable soaks up sweat well
172640	i bought these just to wear when working as i don't wear my real diamond. very cute and look real.
172670	these are cute shoes but the size i wear was what i ordered and they ended up being way too big. i wore them once and it ended up rubbing a big blister on my heels. :( too bad because these are really cute. i just kind of threw them at the back of my closet where they will sit until i give them to a good charity that comes along. which is a good cause but it would have been nice to have received something that fit-
172749	i ordered these for my daughter who is allergic to most jewelry and she loves them. not to mention the price was awesome at the time of purchase.
172804	princess pure look i call them because very one say nice diamond i say thanks but isnt amazon.com is sometime i shop .
172813	i have lots of running shoes and was looking for a good 'cross trainer'. these do not disappoint. plenty of room for the toes---it's not narrow like some of the cuter shoes out there.  i receive tons of compliments whenever i wear an asics shoe.  so colorful, they go with everything:)
172818	i bought this shoe to play indoor racquetball as there are no women-specific shoes for racquetball, only for guys.  it is lightweight and breathable and lets you move freely without even being aware you have shoes on.  my asics gel running shoe that i was using wore out.  it weighed 11.7 oz; this shoe is 2 oz. lighter.  it is quite colorful and generates a lot of inquiries from ladies who want to know what it is and where i got it.  i will definitely buy this shoe again!
172840	narrow at the front, fits good otherwise. asics makes great shoes and for a cheap shoe it does it's job. i am a nursing student on my feet (really i don't really sit) for 13 hours x 2 days a week and these get me through the day pain free. i have always used asics and they make a good shoe. great quality for the price.
172886	these are nice well-fitting shoes.they are great for walking and have a lot of cushion.i have been buying asics since i was young, remember when they were called tigers?
173066	these sneakers fit well, they are good for running and exercise, and looks fun and stylish. good all around sneakers.
173071	i am sure the wallet protects credit card information but when full it is big and bulky and will not fit in my pant pocket.
173079	i've bought a few pairs of these asics gel-contended shoes. i have a pair for myself and i've bought my 13 year old daughter two pairs. most recently i picked her up these in the electric purple/lightning/capri blue color. they look just like they do online. the purple and blue are so cute and go great with jeans.when it comes to fit, they fit like most all other versions of acis running shoes do. so if you know your size in asics, go with that. if you've never worn asics before, you may find they feel a little snug.they tend to be a narrow fitting shoe. so if you that's a problem, you may find that getting them in a half size up will help. like many brands of running shoes, they fit a bit more snug than typical tennis shoes.very cute shoes that both myself and my daughter have a few pairs of and have been wearing for a few years now. when we wear them out, we order another in a new color!
173082	these were ultra comfortable when i put them on right out of the box.  i have not purchased asics before but will do so again based on fit of these.i ordered 1/2 size larger than my normal, per a previous reveiwer, and was pleased i did so.  the 9.5 fit me perfectly.-the gel or cushioning they have is really nice and supportive but soft.-the amount of cushioning they have is great.  found that some shoes have less rubber/cushioning on bottom, but these are well heeled.- shoes fit like glove.  i don't like when tennis feel &#34;sloppy&#34; when you wear them.  these fit very well.-color and styling is fine.
173091	my daughter usually wears gel nimbus, but thought we would try this shoe since it costs $30 less!  she loves it!!!!!
173357	i haven't worn these shoes yet, but they seem good quality. i have asics runner shoes in size 11.5, but these in the same size were 1/2 size too small. i like asics shoes. i hope their made in the usa or some county that doesn't abuse workers like nike. nike just keep raising the price of their shoes to pay drug abusing, sexual assaulting supposed athletes.jordan hasn't bounced a ball in years, but nike sells shoes with his name on them for over $250.
173376	i've tried several trendy sneakers, lately. looking for some stylish supportive shoe for my wide-ish middle-aged feet to wear with leggings. the jack purcell converse style inventory is low, these days. van's support didn't seem great. coach runs narrow. i ordered these before trying the keen's because i like this cute style :-)between colorful athletic sneakers and various casual comfort shoes, i've been trying (and returning) many shoes! i tried these on . . . wore them around the house, and did not want to take them off! they're light/medium-weight, well-constructed, breathable, true-to-size with ample width, and have a good supportive insole and a fairly flexible sole. they are definitely more apt for non-serious athletic activity than the above brands. i even like the orthotic construction better than any of the trendy colorful atheltic-brand sneakers i've been trying! good job and thanks, teva!
173378	bought these for just walking around shoes and running errands, they are so cute !! i have a small foot so they fit me prefect  glad i didn't size up ! shipping was fast!
173380	nice shoes, but not as comfy or cushy as my keens.  they are snug also; i'll have to wear skinny socks.
173429	this is the second slidebelt i've purchased.  what i like about them is the quality of construction, the good looks and the versatility.the buckle is very well made and interchangeable with other slidebelt leathers.  this one is silver, the first i bought is black and came with a black leather belt.  i can move the belts to different buckles.  they have striped buckles and buckles with various finishes.the leather part can be trimmed down at the buckle end to fit, so if your size isn't in stock, but a longer one is available you can get it and cut it down.  the locking tabs that slide into the buckle are sturdy and look like they will last a long time.  the leather part is available in several colors without the buckle, so you can have several belts using the one buckle.  and, if you gain or lose a few pounds, the adjustments seem to be more precise than most belts with holes (i.e.:  closer together for finer adjustment).i think this is a great system.
173434	i purchased two of the v neck scrub tops and one of the square necks and boy, was the square neck top way smaller than the v neck top.  i was so disappointed too because i had liked the  color of the &#34;pink cotton candy&#34;.  just let me say this as well, i am not a small lady.  i am tall and heavy.  if you are a plus size looking for scrubs, be very careful when ordering.  also, if you are familiar with lane bryant, catherine's or roman's which are plus size ladies apparel, do not even begin to think that a 4x top uniform is going to fit like a 4x top from catherine's or romans.  i have two tops i ordered from one stop shop and the tops are so nice and long and i am saddened that they are no longer carrying uniforms.  just a word of warning for those &#34;larger&#34; ladies.
173439	extremely boxy style. not surprising in large sizes, of course. i'm short and ordered a 3x, so.. yeah. scrubs are always going to look pretty boxy, but w/ the square neck top it's worse.however, it's pretty durable feeling (only had it for a few wears). the generic color mix/matches well, so.. it's an ok option. it's not like it's a fashionable job.
173483	this toe ring is very pretty, exactly as depicted. sometimes these are ordered and are very flimsy or cheaply made, but this one is very beautiful and high quality. it is well made and looks brilliant on!
173535	the fabric is thinner than i would have liked but after a couple of washes it seems to have held up, maybe even improved (maybe its because i iron with starch). it's true to fit, proper and tidy. nothing special about it.
173537	it is simple, but elegant t shirt which can be used in any ocasion it is easy to wash and handle. i recommend it
173565	i bought this a gift for my daughter.... it is just beautiful. appears as if it costs much more. love this ring
173577	i bought these as a stocking stuffer for my boyfriend for christmas! they are so warm and he absolutely loves them.
173589	these keep us dry as a bone!!  i got these for a friend and myself, working outside a lot, and they kept me dry and warm!  that along with the price is the trifecta i was looking for!! thanks amazom!
173594	great service and product. the items arrived on time, and were in the condition depicted at the site. i took a chance and bought two pair because this seemed like a nice item at a fair price. i am happy with this purchase.
173634	these became my new favorite pair of earrings. they go great with all my outfits and they are great for casual or formal wear.
173688	my son loves this shoe. it fits well. is good quality and was a great buy when we needed soccer shoes for him recently! well made!
173715	the style is great but the material is on the cheap side.  they are a little lop sided and i am afraid to bend them.
173759	these are made well and are warm.. but just not for me! they are thicker and give you the look of being 20 lbs heavier then what you are.. that look no fun and bulky sweats so uncomfy to me! they are not a soft material.. more like a light coat of a waxy type material! but as i stated they are made well if these sweats are for you!
173770	these pants are pretty awesome. i live in the north and they're very warm.i suggest washing them inside out so the fuzz gets washed out but other than that. love these pants. i ordered true to size and they fit just fine as well. (medium)-king
173851	i wasn't sure about ordering this brand of workout pants since i normally associate russell brands with men's sportswear.  however, i was pleasantly surprised that these fit well and hit me at just the right place on my leg (below the knee).  the only reason i'm not giving these pants a five is because after one washing, the seams in the sides of the legs seemed to pucker a little.
173855	this was exactly what i needed. my daughter needed cleats for baseball - and these fit the bill. i know they are advertised as soccer shoes - but the work fine for t-ball.
173871	the picture doesn't do these sneakers justice; in person, they are much nicer. also dc's are comfortable. additionally, you cannot beat the price!
173899	my husband asked me to order these pants because i am the internet guru in the family. he loves them. he ordered several because you can never have too many of a good thing! they are nice-looking and exactly what he wanted.
173952	the plastic molded part is not shaped well and digs into the kids' feet and the liner makes this boot difficult to put on and take off.  it's a warm boot once you get it on the kid but really a pain in the neck and not at all the kind of thing i wanted.  wouldn't purchase again.
173987	i like these shoes, and i have another pair of jessica simpson's that are an 8 also and they fit great. these are a little big. i can still wear them, but it feels like my foot might slid right out of the front of them when i'm walking. other then that their a great shoe. i'd just get a half a size smaller.
174057	simple, sporty, cool watch. i'm getting lots of compliments. i have only 4 stars just b/c the band show some signs of friction after 4 weeks.all together, love it, highly recommended.
174063	i bought this watch in black a few weeks ago:timex men's t2n647kw weekender black slip through strap watchi loved the black watch so much, i came back to grab one in white. as i said in my other review, the straps on these are rather small, so i'd recommend getting a separate nato strap if you have a bigger wrist. the strap that comes on the watch is not a nato strap, but similar in style, it just doesn't have the second fabric loop to keep your watch securely on the strap.even buying a separate strap, this watch is an incredible deal. the time is impeccable, the style gets nothing but compliments, and the indiglo light is great for reading your watch at night without glowing hands. it's a great summer watch, much lighter than a steel bracelet and easy to swap bands to match whatever you're wearing.
174072	i bought this watch for my girlfriend as a present and now it sits in a drawer.  this watch looks nice and works fine except it is the loudest watch i have ever heard.  this watch is louder than a wind up clock.  the ticking on it can be heard across the room from inside a sock drawer.  go with something else.
174098	so, i bought these jeans in two washes for my husband. he always wears the same size. always. yet, the other wash fit him and these didn't. when i held them up to the other pair, they were at least a full inch in the waist smaller. same fit, same everything, just different color.thank goodness amazon is so excellent about returns!
174231	i hadn't bought leggings since the 90s so i wasn't sure what i was getting myself into.  but these are fantastic.  the tummy shaping panel is very wide and very flattering.  i'm 5'8&#34; and 200lbs and the xl fit really well, though at first i wasn't sure.  they look really small but they fit well, though just a bit on the short side for me being tall.  i felt they were a little bit pricey, but it's definitely worth it.  love them.
174238	i've only worn these socks a couple times so far (i only got them last week) but when i did, they worked well. they stayed on my heel and kept me from getting blisters which is why i bought them. the only thing that kind of bugged me was my feet are a little wide towards my toes so the sock kept falling off the side of my foot to the point where it was just on my first 4 toes and not my baby toe but since that isn't a problem area for me, it wasn't a big deal. i was expecting these socks not to work since my feet are size 11 and slightly wide but i think they're great. i maybe wouldn't get them if you have big feet and the sides of your feet are the area you wanna protect, but for heels and the back of your feet, they're great. also, they kept my feet from getting really smelly from this really old pair of flats that i have so that was great too. also, they barely show above my shoes and they're a naturally looking tan color so they blend in well.
174244	i bought these becuase i wear alot of flats and slip ons. i normally wear them with no socks and after awhile, they smell so bad. these socks are comfy, have a little gel pad at the heel so that they dont slip off, and they come in black and nude. great buy!
174325	this sock is your basic no show sock that goes great in athletic shoe or even my converse.  i don't use then for when i'm working out as they don't have that much cushion...i use my nike cushy socks for that. these are, however, very comfortable and a great price.  if you are looking for something just basic to wear for walking around then these might be a good fit for you.
174352	my baltic amber sterling silver oval ring fit beautifully and goes with the pendant and earrings i already owned.  it is quite an additionmaking them a gorgeous set.
174459	these are more affordable than under armour or nike or adidas but not a whit less in design or quality.top design, top quality and style!they fit well, are comfortable, ventilate well, no thigh or chaffing in that region downunder, and remain dry and decent all day long.i like these so much i am seriously considering avoiding all cotton shorts and only wearing these sports style shorts due to the comfort, dryness, hygiene etc.awesome product
174476	after hearing my fiance constantly complain about his chafing thighs i went on search and found these. he loves them. no chafing, he says they are comfortable, and i think they look really sexy. done deal, back to get more.update: we just returned from a three day trip to disneyland in mid august heat and humidity- no chafing at all, these are great!
174514	it is not unusual for boxer briefs to fit well when you put them on.  in the course of the day, however, they generally stretch out, allowing the legs to ride up and generally losing their sex appeal.  these do not.  the fabric retains its snug fit and its slight sheen, even after several washings.  most important, she loves them too.
174653	i've worn smartwool socks for years, and i'm a convert to wool socks.  i saw these at rei and loved the colors (i have a weakness for whimsical socks) and gave them a try.  they're cute and comfortable.  so much fun to wear!  i went back and bought anther in a different color!things i like:--well made.  they hold up in the wash, and i haven't noticed any shrinkage.  the colors have stayed bright.-- they stay up.  i hate socks that slide down!a couple of caveats:--the socks aren't as soft as  my smartwool socks.  i think that might be due to having a higher wool percentage?  i don't find them scratchy but fyi.--there's no padding or cushion at all.  i've since bought a couple pairs of darn tough socks that have that, but these are without the cushion.  i like them anyway, but your milage may vary.--darn tough socks don't seem to be as stretchy as some socks; be sure you get the right size.  i can get away with smartwool mediums but needed the larges in darn tough!
174666	this tank is great...it's loose fit but not baggy, runs true to size, ventilates well, & the bright colors really pop!  it's a bit longer in the armpits than their normal ribbed tanks, which is nice when you're really sweaty, & hangs down to the middle of your butt, which is nice when i wear tights.  it dries really quickly when you're sweaty & doesn't seem to hold on to any stink or sweat.
174671	this is a really nice tube top/ bra......it is long, so i get great coverage....plus the material is nice and stretchy but strong enough to give support.....very comfortable!!!
174672	"i'm a large 44d size and have had difficulty finding a comfortable strapless bra to go under thin to spaghetti strapped tops. i've tried numerous items but could not find one that fit comfortably and did not smash my chest like a pancake due to sizing issues. i liked the idea that this top was long waisted (11"") because i knew i would need that length to cover my chest area, which it did just fine. so whether you want to wear this top as a stand alone top or as a bra under tops, this would look nice either way. it is very soft and comfortable, no jabbing wires no buldging and no worries about not fitting properly or squashing your chest, this just may be the right size for everyone (especially full figured or full chested girls)."
174691	"these fit the bill on what i needed. a strapless ""binding"" solution that didn't require an underwire. i'm not planning on wearing these alone. mostly these were purchased as support under off the shoulder type tops. however, if you are on the bustier side of the spectrum as i am - 36g/36ddd/42"" bust - these are not opaque. hehe... the white is certainly see through. the black does show some translucency when stretched out and between the breasts, though it is nowhere near as bad as the white. the band at the top is a little snug and might become uncomfortable after a while but i didn't notice pinching. the bottom half stretched down to my hips just fine, though it might be an issue for anyone on the mid to upper spectrum of the plus sizes. support is minimal, but better than nothing, and a heck of a lot more comfortable than a strapless bra. i'll probably double up the hem to the top on the white one to take care of the opacity issue when wearing any lighter colored tops."
174695	don't get me wrong. they are very nice. and 12 pairs for 21 bucks is a steal. however, they do not come down like boxer shorts on the legs as shown in the photo. it isn't a deal breaker, and i will still wear them. its just not what i was expecting.
174798	i think if i could get this in an e instead of a d i would love it. it seemed comfortable, but it was a might too narrow.
174833	perfect chain for my new pendant and it hasn't tarnished.. very satisfied with it!!! gonna get me another one in longer length .
174837	this jewelry store is the most consumer friendly i have dealt with period. any issues anyone may encounter will be rectified promptly! i would and continue to shop with them without hesitation
174903	not bad.  good fit, nice drop, breathe great.  not good to break them in with a half marathon as it may cause horrific blisters, but that applies to any shoes.
174950	this top is very comfortable but runs alittle bigger than expected. it is a great top tho, very light weight and comfortable.
174965	i am slowly getting all the colors, i am 6 foot 1 inch tall, and finding a good fitting shirt is hard to do, these are a nice fit, just right, a little loose in all the right places, which helped after i had my twins, now they are looking even better on me... :)
174978	after a long search for the perfect running shoe, i came across the ride four! and wore them religiously (i am a half marathon runner, but i usually run about 20 miles a week)once it came time to get a new pair, i was sad to discover that it was discontinued. and replaces with the ride 5. upon reading the reviews of the ride 5, the main complaint is the narrower toe box (one of my favorite aspects of the ride 4.but after trying a couple different shoes, i decided to give the ride 5 a try. the wide size was too wide, so i went with the average width.while it is a narrower toe box, i think i can live with it. the shoes are super comphy, but my toes do burn after longer runs. i will keep this updated after my next half marathon in october (first with this pair)but if the saucony gods are out there listening. if you want a perfect shoe, keep the  8mm heel drop and bring back the wider toe box.
175004	finely made. good materials with excellent stitching to hold it together.  sizes are made for the asian body (much smaller than the typical american).  i'm 6 foot 4, 175 pounds, and an athletic build with wider shoulders than waist.  i ordered the &#34;large&#34; size and find it to be sung - not bad, but snug.  i bought two different colors and am impressed.  as long as i don't add another 10 pounds, these will last a lifetime.i was also extremely impressed that the vest was sent from south korea and arrived faster than items ordered from the eastern us.
175043	well as you've already noticed, the sizing chart is different, confusing, and possibly discouraging. i'm 6'1'' and about 185lbs. i purchased the xxlarge, large for americans, and they were right. pretty spot on with the american sizing, but definitely for a slim fit. if you're a bigger guy in any way, don't bother. the fabric is stiff, but i haven't washed it as of yet to see if it will remain that way. also, the sleeves as in the picture, with the nice contrasting cuff, yeah that's pretty hard to achieve as it is only one roll and most take two rolls to reach the mid forearm. some finagling is needed to get the right roll and still have the contrast color show. the design and cut though are enough to compensat for these minor inconveniences. it's my new fancy, i might be somebody, going out shirt.
175134	"i wore this dress for a garden wedding.  it was too long so i hemmed it.  i am 5'2"" and i took in approximately 3 inches.  hemming it did not destroy the design of the dress. the dress falls great and for the price is a great buy."
175169	i love this dress, i have the white one and it has a slip/lining in it so that it's not see-thru so i can wear it anywhere.  i'm going to wear a belt to dress it up a little and taking it with me on our vacation next week! will look hot with some wedges or cute flip flops for going out to a casual restaurant or the beach- definitely recommend! :)
175184	i can wear this to work with heels or casually with flip flops.  a cardigan or a shrug dresses this right up.  and it is incredibly comfortable.  the top is lined, so it is not too revealing and the shirring at the top and elasticized waist give the dress nice definition so it is not too slouchy.  the hemline is gorgeous, but not too revealing -- very elegant without being stuffy.  i loved it so much i got it in green.  i am very curvy/hour glass shaped and it fit well.
175203	this maxi dress is super cute and i love the flower detail. it can be dressed up or dressed down. the only downside is it's a little long for me, but perfect with heels. the bottom has a hem so it flutters the tail out, so it can be a little restricting. but gorgeous overall.
175229	this is my 3rd pair of frye boots. nothing compares to the quality & comfort straight out of the box. i bought these in the antique stone because i wanted that bit of &#34;worn in&#34; look to it. these are perfect. they have a slight greyish tone to them, not a patent leather black. perfect with jeans or skirts. get yourself some over the knee boot socks for a different look with your boots! since there is no zipper, putting them on the 1st time is a bit of a struggle, but not a problem after that. i love these!
175261	stunning in quality & craftsmanship...after reading the reviews, i ordered up a size ...i figured this would be ample room, right? not by a long shot...the toe box is for a very narrow foot (which i have)...the calves are great. the colour is spot on...i am keeping these babies. but, amazonians, order up!
175291	the first pair we ordered for my husband were his regular shoe size, 10 4e, but they were too tight.  we exchanged them for a 10.5 4e, which fit fine.
175321	my husband has been a 10 1/2 for the past 40 years. these sneakers ran small. may want to order a 1/2 size up.
175404	i got this for my daughter who is working in nyc.  she had been avoiding getting a down coat because they make you look puffy, but with her new job requiring long walks from the subway, she finally let me buy her one.she is a shorty with an athletic figure, 5'4&#34; with broad shoulders, and usually wears a size 6 in clothes.  first we tried the small, and although it looked fantastic, it was tight across the shoulders like other reviewers have said.  we were worried about the medium, but it fit beautifully with plenty of room to move.the belt does need to be tied instead of buckled, but along with the slightly-fitted construction of the coat, it creates good shape instead of looking bulky.  the hood is definitely huge, but fleece-lined and really warm.  we've seen no feathers pop out yet.this coat is very warm when the temperature is around freezing, and adequately-warm when in the teens.  my daughter layers it over a fleece when it's really cold, and has been just fine on her long walks with the recent wind chills of zero degrees.
175451	now that i've tried spanx bras i am never going back.  this is the most comfortable, most durable bra i've ever owned.  this is my second one!
175484	these shoes are awesome, and they look much better in person!  the blue is a nice rich color, and they look like they would be much more that i paid for them.  i usually wear a 7-7.5 and the 7.5 fit me perfectly.  they aren't that uncomfortable, but no heels are extremely comfy anyways.  i love them!
175582	if you are 5'8&#34; or taller these definitely wont work well on you. these ride up to above my knees and the stitching around the bottom is not stretchy so it makes it really uncomfortable to bend your knees and it digs in when doing squats etc. also, the waist band is very narrow and rides lowish. you tighten it with a drawstring and to make sure they stay up, you will most likely get a muffin top. i find myself constantly adjusting them and there is an inside pocket at the hip and it always bunches up and looks like you have an abscess. the material is good though, not see through.
175591	i'm on a new workout plan and decided to get some workout tights. i needed a pair that could work for kickboxing, hot yoga, or just simple walks to the park. i wanted to spend more like 20 or less per pair of tights, but unfortunately most of them are more like 30 or so per pair.style/material/fit:typical workout dri-fit type material, a little more thin than thick, which actually works nicely for these.  they are a little more on the shiny side of the dri-fit (not shiny like disco 80s shiny, but that typical dri-fit sheen). they have sort of underlaying flesh tone sheen, as if they're lined with a pink/brown type color... the leggings are black of course, but the sheen shows when you're in the sun. i loooove the draw string in the waist bands, love love love it... this if my first pair like this and now i wonder why all leggings don't have it! the drawstring make the fit perfect. i like the design of these pants which contour the body quite nicely. very comfortable, stretchy, and soft. the material is however a little unforgiving when it comes to showing any, well, let's just say &#34;not as smooth&#34; areas on your thighs/legs/butt. for the most part you can't see anything when in a room or at the gym, but in the sun because the shininess and flesh colored underlayer you can see some indentions, which of course no woman wants to show.i chose the all black with the pink on the waistband and i love them, they look very athletic.sizing:i initially purchased a large, but it was just too small, this was a huge disappointment to be honest since that is my usual size in most leggings. the large technically fit me, but was too tight on my waist and sat right under my stomach making it look bigger. i do believe that if these had a wide  waist band i would have probably been able to fit a large, but since these have a small waistband the large was too small. i then reordered for a size extra large (xl) and they fit very nicely. i have a statuesque type shape/figure-- 5'7, 188lb (i probably &#34;look&#34; more like 158 just because of my even/curvy proportion) i carry most of my weight in my chest and butt/thighs. i do have a bit of a &#34;pudge&#34;, lol, which should, no i'll say &#34;will&#34;... which will be gone by the end of the month with all the kickboxing and working out i'm doing :-).  because of the beloved drawstring on the inside waist i'm able to just tighten these pants as a loose weight-- that feature alone will save me from having to buy another pair until i fit into a medium or small in the next couple months.working out:these are very comfortable during the workout. they certainly keep me cool and absorb sweat well.summary:the fit is a little too small so i had to order a size up. the material is soft and comfortable. if you're on the hunt for workout leggings i say give these a try
175594	comfortable and not see-through. i wish they were a little more supportive (very minimal in that area) but otherwise they are great.
175644	i have plantar fasciitis (which causes heel pain with every step) and decided to check out this brand, which has a reputation for providing good fit and comfort.  i saw this product listing and decided to try the new balance ww759 shoes in the blue/grey.i had never tried on new balance shoes before, so i ordered the two most usual shoe sizes for me (the smaller of the two was my typical size and the larger of the two was a half size up from that), knowing that i could count on amazon's great shoe return policy for the pair that didn't fit.sadly, neither pair fit my feet.  even the larger of the two shoe sizes was too small length-wise - so i would have had to go up one further half-size, at least, for this shoe to be long enough for my foot.  unfortunately, both of the pairs i got were too big in the heel, so going up another half-size would make the fit in the heel even worse.due to the poor fit, it was clear that i'd have to send both sizes of the 759 style back, and try a different model of new balance shoes, or a different brand altogether.positives of the ww759:-the base of the shoe did feel very comfortable and supportive in terms of my heel pain / plantar fasciitis.-the shoe seemed well-made.-it looked like the photo in the listing.--------because i was surprised that the heel fit me so poorly, i had a look on the new balance website for further information on how their shoes are sized.  oddly, i had to dig around quite a bit in their faq section to find useful information on this.to make their shoes, they use several different kinds of lasts (shoe forms/bases), and these vary along 4 dimensions - the fit at the heel, the fit at the instep, the fit at the toe box, and the fit at the forefoot.**note:  this ww759 shoe is listed as having an al-2 last, which offers a standard heel size, a higher instep, a deeper toebox, and a standard forefoot.**on their website, you can select what sort of shape your foot has, and what sort of fit you are interested in, and see which styles match it.--------in a comment attached to this review, i will post the best internet links i could find about new balance's sizing and shoe last information.  i hope this might help some folks as they are shopping online for new balance shoes.
175655	i'm a fat footed (wide) person and always have a hard time finding shoes to fit my feet. new balance tennis shoes have always been my first choice since they offer shoes in different widths. this shoe is so comfortable to walk in, i feel like i'm walking on pillows. love 'em! you will, too. they do run wider than usual so buy one width size down from your previous nb tennies.
175667	great walking shoe...lots of support and room for your digits. no regrets buying this shoe so far. there is however  a bit of fraying along the padded edge where it meets the shoelace eyelets.... hope this doesn't become an issue.
175669	the footbed on these is amazing--so comfortable! i felt like i went to heaven in these shoes. but the size seems just a tad large (maybe a 1/2 size).
175686	this shoe fits  fantastic and was shipped ontime!  comfortable shoe and will buy again. great walking shoe, perfect for walking at least 8 hours a day!
175720	the three star rating reflects my disappointment when i discovered these boots were made in chinathe ads led me to understand they were european made.overall quality is nice, leather good, style attractive. there is no cushioning or arch support.if you have concerns in these areas pass them by.i kept them, and have worn them several times i have orthotics that fit into them nicely.
175784	"it's so hard for me to find a wide athletic shoe. add pink to the mix, and it's near impossible! but i have found a gem in these shoes and i want to stockpile my closet with them before they disappear. i work out for 2 hours a day, 6 days a week in the gym. that's 12+ hours that i need a shoe to help me perform my best. i do the stair climber, elliptical, spin class, insanity and thanks to these shoes, now running! i am beyond thrilled to have found a shoe that works for my wide feet. i have no pain running in these and i ran a 10k just a week after purchasing these. there was no need for breaking these in.  you really shouldn't have to ""break in"" a shoe if it fits properly, but that is something that has escaped me until now. if you have a wide foot, you know what i mean about limited options on colors and styles so consider giving this shoe a try."
175835	we have hardwood floor in 80% of our home so i always need new slippers. i bought these because they're open toed for summer and also because the top is adjustable for my high instep. these are very comfortable and i've worn them for a couple months now. the fit is good.  my only caution would be that these might not be great for older folks or anyone who might be more prone to a fall (pregnant women, older people, disabled or injured people). they have a kind of thick and bulky front that extends beyond the toes a little ways and could contribute to a trip or fall. i quickly got used to them but i'm mindful of it on the stairs and such. just an fyi. the soles are thick and grip the floor securely. i can even run into the garage or outside on the porch to get a package etc. and they're thick enough that they give nice support.
175866	fit a little lose, i wear a 6.5-7 , but they are lose, but comfy. are very well made . i will get the next smaller size.
175983	these little mittens are perfect. they keep baby's sharp nails from scratching their face. i recommend them in different sizes!
176019	got this case because i had one similar and i liked it, but this one wasn't as good quality as the one i had. the zip has already started to undo and i only have it about 2 months now. i also found zippered cases at walmart for cheaper than this. if i had realised this before, i would not have bought it here
176077	disappointing shoe from nb. construction is cheap... seams were mis-matched and glued poorly. no support in the footbed. uncomfortable interior seams across the toes. cute appearance. buy them if you're not picky about comfort and wearing for more than one season.
176114	just browsing some online shopping offers and suddenly i came across the ak anne klein collection. my sis had always loved their collection and wanted a black dress for church wear and i thought i would surprise her. i got the size details from my mom and quickly placed an order for the honeycomb swing dress (black). the dress was a perfect fit for my sister and she loves the flare effect of the dress. the red belt is neat on the waist. with a variety of size options available finding the right size was not at all difficult. i am planning to get the v neck cotton dress also for her.
176173	i've seen these in the stores and thought i'd give one a try. i started by attempting to transfer the contents of my bi-fold, windowed, money-clip, front-pocket wallet:* three credit cards* two state issued id cards* insurance card (credit card sized)* five store loyalty cards (credit card sized)* school id (in a sleeve with bus pass taped to outside)* two hotel room keys* five business cards* five bills of us cashthat did not even come close to fitting. here's what i managed to get in comfortably:* three credit cards* two state issued id cards* insurance card (credit card sized)* five store loyalty cards (credit card sized)* one hotel room keyadding one more item caused the case not to seal entirely. adding two more made it hard to close (and reopen). adding three more made it impossible to close.here are the major negatives:* us cash needs to be folded into thirds or quarters to fit. that makes the cash very thick. if i take out three cards, i can get the cash in.* student id with sleeve did not fit at all. it was just too big. i may be able to trim the sleeve a little with a pen-knife, but that's a pain.fortunately, this thing is pretty inexpensive. i'll try to go through the stack and see what i can take out.update: after using it for a couple days, i added a star! what is really cool about this wallet is that it opens like an expanding filing system. you can easily get to any individual card inside. i find it's easier to fumble around to get my hotel room key card out with my hands full than my old wallet.
176209	i got this as a secondary wallet, because i carry a ton of rewards cards and passes. it's absurd that every place you shop gives you some credit card thing, but yet they aren't making regular wallets with enough slots to accommodate. this does the trick, though. it fits almost all of my cards in it, freeing my actual wallet for my more regularly used cards.this fits about ten credit cards and four or five business cards comfortably. more than that and it has closing issues. i like that it comes in an array of colors. the patterns they have aren't very attractive, though.i'm a little annoyed that it says it has &#34;seven secure slots fold out accordion style,&#34; which to me implies that the seven slots all fold out. it does have seven slots, but only five of them really fold out. the other two are attached to the inside of the case, making it difficult to get cards in and out of those two slots.all in all though, this does the job, and even with the slot issue, it fits about as many cards as i expected it to. the clasp is pretty secure, though it's just a plastic push button clasp, so i'd be careful not to drop it or anything. if you take care of your stuff it shouldn't be a problem. i'm debating getting another one to replace my main wallet for cash and my license. we'll see if they come up with any in patterns i like. a single flat color gets boring.
176334	i really like this jacket. it looks great on. i bought a medium and i am 5'3 and around 130 lbs. there is plenty of room to wear thick sweaters without it being tight. the sleeves are little long on me but i prefer it that way when it is cold out.
176347	i returned this because i saw the benton springs long hoodie which i liked better - this is probably a good jacket but not my style...
176383	ok, assuming you buy these as a cheap-o pack of undies, not 'date-night panties' you will probably be fairly impressed.  i was.  they're just as pictured.  size is right.  fit is comfortable.  the waist has a pretty thick seam which can be seen through some clothing.  the legs are much smoother/flatter than i expected and isn't noticeable through clothing.  i'll be looking for more items from this manufacturer now that i know it's good for the money.
176391	bought this shoe as an &#34;in-between&#34; when i want to be dressy than flats, but more comfortable than heels. works well with business casual to jeans to even hitting the bar after work.
176405	very cute and the price is right!! small, simple and look very sparkly. so worth the price if you are looking for just some basic diamond studs.
176412	wish i had ordered these but glad to know they are available they come with a nice gift pouch and good price. the arrive timely and as expected
176421	these look like more expensive earrings and these don't have any issues with exploitive mining practices. i am getting more in various sizes.
176478	i can't see the diamonds but this is a rather large piece that does make a statement. it is very nice.
176539	i didn't think that it was possible! the gii version of this superb bag is even more secure than my previous 250. it holds my kindle in its cover and my tablet in its cover in the main compartment. the gii has a deeper front-pocket compartment with two deeper sections (plus two pen holders). one section offers rfid protection for those who carry credit cards or a passport with micro chips (rfidsafe keeps hi-tech identity thieves from downloading personal information stored in the chips); in the second pocket i keep my keys on chain attached to the key clip so i can unlock doors without detaching from the bag. instead of a change-purse size little compartment on the front of the front pouch, there is a deep pocket on the back of the bag that is against the body (i really like this); the older bag lacks this back pocket. side pockets are adequate for an umbrella or water bottle and secure location for my cell. the bag i chose is a grayer blue-gray than pictured on my monitor but that might be a quirk in my display. i bought my first bag for travel but enjoy the many features for daily use and after several years the old bag shows little wear even though i have used it daily.
176565	only negative is the wire mesh strap can dig in.  the number of pockets is excellent as well as the rfid passport protection pocket and padded tablet pocket.  i never travel with a laptop anymore.  this small purse holds everything i need.  i particularly like having my reading glasses and computer glasses stored in the outer side pockets.  the snaps keep them from slipping out and the are super easy to access.  as far as inside room.  on a trip it easily holds my tsa makeup clear baggy and my travel first aid kit in addition to my wallet and tablet.  the loop handle is also perfect for attaching one of those on the go hand sanitizes.  i use all the zipper locks in airports and crowded situations and follow rick steve's advice and keep small bills in the back zipper pocket so i never have to access the main pocket in crowds,  i wear it cross body and never take it off on day tours, the no bag left behind policy.  hope these tips help,  be sure to check out the pacsafe tour safe wallet i use them both everyday and feel just as safe at the grocery store as in a foreign country.
176567	"this hip pouch works ok if you have a larger waist, being petite, it is too big for my waist and i can't make it small enough to fit my 25"" waist.  i do like, but it's not large enough to fit my phone and camera while on vacation.  the pouch is soft, but the strap/handle is stiff and not very comfortable over the shoulder either.  the green color is a very nice sage green."
176650	i wear these shoes on a regular basis when working out and have been extremely pleased with them. the shoes provide ample arch support and also have enough padding to prevent my feet from blistering. one of the best things about this shoe in my opinion is the fact that the design allows for the shoes to mold to my heels. i have had issues previously with my heels slipping out of other shoes as i run, but with these my feet stay snugly in place during the entire workout.
176677	just got back from a 3 day work trip to dallas.  had 4 days worth of clothes, 2 pairs of shoes, shaving kit, and more with plenty of room left over, did not even need the expansion opened.  i was able to fit this bag into the overhead bin of an airbus jet without any issues.  wheels are great, they glide perfectly on concrete, dense carpet, or tile.  included dirty laundry/shoe bag is a nice plus.  plenty of pockets.  handle is light and smooth, but much stronger than it looks.
176719	i read all the negatives and i found them to be false. this hat is big for my 6'05&#34; stature and warm for the polar vortex that has been plaguing the east this winter. it works for me and it keeps me warm.
176728	i love the look of these shoes.  they are also cushioned nice.  but along the little toe area they're a little tight.  i do not wear wide shoes so i was surprised at the fit on these.  i'm wearing them around the house to break them in to see if they get more comfortable.  but this is why i usually don't buy shoes online.  :/
176759	purchased this samsonite boarding bag thinking that it would be an additional bag to organize kiddo items for travel and would &#34;blend in&#34; with our grown-up luggage.unfortunately, had to return this immediately. it is so poorly made, does not appear to be durable, and looks very cheap. pretty shocked that this was a samsonite item. very disappointed.
176772	returned.
176872	i'm very petite, but i expected the small to still be form fitting...it's quite lose in the bust area and doesn't look flattering. the material on the shirt is great and very warm. but if you're kind of a petite girl like me i wouldn't buy it
176882	this sweater ran small on me, so i ordered a large instead of what i normally wear (medium).  the neckline is extremely low and the shoulders are much wider than shown, so i cannot wear a strapped bra with the sweater. strapless is the only option. i have lots of creamy upper deck showing in this sweater, and it's gorgeous, but inappropriate for some venues. that all being said, it fits nicely snug without squeezing, is made heavier than i thought it would be, so it doesn't show every bump and buckle, and the style is extremely flattering.  i love it, but be aware that it fits much lower in front and much wider than pictured on the mannequin.
176921	i like puma because it combines quality and good price, size according to what is shown, excellent material, as we say here &#34;puma es puma&#34;
176935	i'm pretty tough on my luggage; i travel frequently, overstuff the poor things and include business documents, heavy items like shampoo/conditioner (full size) with shoes, etc., and usually find that a corner zipper cannot withstand the strain of the contents i throw in the bag plus the airlines' abuse.  thus far, this suitcase has not only held up incredibly well against the beatings, it also has the added bonus of standing out very well in the crowd - in a good way.  the bright color is kinda cool looking (and i know it sounds dweeby but i'm not one who likes to stand out).  my only complaint is that naturally the rubbings and beatings are showing against the bright green-yellow.  darn.  so it isn't as pretty anymore.  but as long as it will maintain its strength, and as long as the color stays different and somewhat &#34;cool,&#34; this little hottie will keep traveling with me.
176962	hell-o. i am a lady and i purchases this for me. i wanted something cool to wear to bed and i had not tried bamboo before. what a wonderful surprise. if i were a man, i would purchase these buy the hand fulls. these will help to keep you cool when it is hot and they will help keep you warm when it cold, when it comes to soft, wow. i am sold on bamboo. this shirt is a great price also.
176984	softest, most comfortable briefs yet.  you cannot go wrong with these. reasonable price, quick shipment, no problems whatsoever.  give them a try.
176995	super cute and super cheap pink earings every girl has got to have many many accessories :) love these earings
177081	the shoes are true-to-size (i ordered a size 7), very light and soft inside.  i can walk in these shoes for hours without any burning feeling in my feet.  i'll buy the other colors today!
177119	"i am on my feet sometimes all day and sometimes half days (sitting sometimes). i am a auditor and need to be stylish and comfortable all at the same time (business meetings allot). i work from 7 -4:30 or later and then have to shop for the house after work ( many days),  but, i wear these with my dress slacks, jeans or skirts. i have never been so comfortable for long periods of time. i am use to wearing 3 inch heels and now that i have found these shoes, i may never do heels again ""unless i have to :(. you will not regret buying these babies and now everyone in my office has them and they love them as much as i do......... thanks clarks bayberry"
177146	i have always wanted some clogs but have a very narrow foot.  so i was surprised i could get a pair in size 10 2n.  i absolutely love them.  i wear them all the time.
177188	i like this style of shoe from clark's.  i ordered the c/d size instead of the medium and it is much more comfortable over the top of my foot right out of the box.  i don't consider myself to have a wide foot but this shoe by clark in a medium always feels too tight at first.  nice not to go through the break in phase and i can wear with whatever socks i want right out of the box.
177209	they felt comfortable right away. it has a nice look that can go from casual to business.i would buy again.
177222	after nearly three months traveling abroad i have to say these are one of the best pair of shoe i have come across.  i could dress up and wear the black shoes with my wool slacks or go for a walk in the city in my jeans.  i like my shoes a little bigger so if my feet swell it isn't a problem.  i wear a between a 9 1/2 and 10 m.  i walked along cobblestone pathways, ventured through malls, and even some hiking on a tour.  they were easy to clean and did not scratch. a quick brush and some light polish and i was ready to go again.  i am ordering these shoes in two more colors.  probably the most comfortable shoes i have ever worn!
177223	i love clark's in general, but these fit just right and are super comfortable. i love the way they look with jeans. the way they turned the leather differently on the toe makes them interesting and unique. i bought these for a trip where i know i will be walking a lot, and i'm so glad i did.
177266	this corset is pretty nice considering the cost. it is a &#34;fashion corset&#34; - meaning it's not meant to actually shape your figure as it doesn't have metal boning - and it's fine for occasional wear. i was actually surprised by how well it was made (except for the back ribbon which is really thin and cheap) but i have two small problems: a) when i tighten it correctly it's just a tad too big (i have a 34&#34; bust and 27&#34; waist) and really short - but i am 5'10&#34; so that might be okay for someone shorter. the color is a little bit less saturated than in the picture and a tad towards champagne.
177304	i ordered these before i read all the sizing reviews, then was very worried they'd be way too small. i take a 7.5 in toeless sandals and an 8 in closed toe shoes. sometimes i even wear an 8 narrow. well...... these, in 8, are a slam-dunk perfection fit. no binding and no loose areas, at all. whew!i love that you can slide in and out of them without putting up with a floppy fit. the foot opening is nice and tight. it's now my go-to shoe whenever i walk out the door.
177306	pro's:  extremely comfortable!  extreme quality shoe. waterproof. like all keen's; a bit bulky; i would describe these as more looking like a 'fairy' shoe!  which is kinda' cute! excellent for just walking.  i tried this while running some errands today; i am in the house and i don't want to take them off my feet. excellent toe room; maybe a tad smaller than most keen's; and a bit wide in the heel; but i have narrow heels; just put a slightly heavier sock on...these are more comfortable than most sneakers that i own; which are few because none fit my feet.  the insane price!  27-something for a shoe with an msrp of 109!  crazy!  i ordered myself another pair; and a pair each for my twins...cons: they don't make this shoe in a 'summer' model!  please make in a summer model, keen!  i am wearing them today in upstate ny in 55 degree weather; even in house; and they are not hot; my feet are not sweating.  i did go up 1/2 size from my normal keen size; which is an 8.5-based on other reviews, purchased a size 9 and perfect; no issues getting my feet in them either...i cannot emphasize how comfortable they are; there is a very cushioned 'front' on these when you step down in them...and some sort of outer side foot support; which is the best way i can describe it...these are just the perfect shoes!  highly recommend them. hoping i can wear for a while longer...meaning the weather!
177336	oklet me preface this review by saying that ii have fairly average width smallish feet. i normally wear a 7, but after reading the comments on other reviews noting difficulty in getting feet into these boots, i ordered the 7.5. i have very high arches so i normally wouldn't even attempt boots that didn't have a zipper. the length is actually really good. it was a bit tight getting my feet in but its doable. its not difficult enough to discourage me from wearing them at all. i have thin heels so i do have wobble room in the back but idk how that could be avoided and me be able to get my foot in there. these are super comfortable, even with the higher wedge. i was concerned bc i have rheumatoid arthritis and really can't do shoes with any height at all these days. i'm 34 and i feel like i could walk all day in these. the style is plain enough to not go out of style really quickly. they look great with skinny jeans. even my regular jeans can tuck in if i want them to. the only reason these boots got 4 stars instead of 5 from me is that the color is so weird. i got the color called miles. they are sort of a chocolate brown but in certain light they almost have a purple tone to them. weird. i don't care. i'm keeping them and wearing them as often as possible. new boots! yay!!
177342	these boots are fantastic!!! first, the leather. it's sort of a softer type of leather as if you're holding a very soft piece of cowhide-- the inside is black & very soft, like a true piece of leather. the top edges are very soft and thin. it lays very smooth and comfortably on the leg. i usually wear a sz 7 in boots, altho sometimes a 6.5 is enough. here the 6.5 is more than enough so bear that in mind, even tho everyone's foot runs different. btw, the sizing applies to the foot part as well as the leg. for those who are looking for a really tight snug fit around the calves, they werent like that on me, but they werent unshapely either. meaning, they are very slightly loose along the leg (even tho i took the smaller sz) but they look great on the leg-- they have a shape to it, so i love them! i tried them with tights but with pants they'd probably have a snugger fit. i havent worn them yet. ohh & the wedge! omg what could be better? you get the height if you want it, but it's as comfy and no wobbliness yay! the toe box is round in case you cant see that clearly, so no shmushed toes. i just adore these boots, but the leather takes the cake, it has some lines running thru the it like a raw piece of leather- i love it. it's a matter of taste tho. i think it gives it a bit of edge. they're not clunky looking on me at all. very trendy while still being so comfy & lightweight too. this line is a hit.
177370	my middle school son (a big kid) needed good solid running shoes for pe class in school and these were perfect. they have held up well and look like new.
177397	this pendant is pretty however the weight is just not there, i have worn it and it &#34;floats around&#34; on the chain, it doesn't hang like a true pendant. it's too lightweight to be taken seriously. i would not recommend for an adult woman.
177429	i cant't believable this pendant is so well made. when i opened the package i was pleasantly surprised. i may have to purchase the earrings also.
177432	i am very impressed with the quality of the amazingly clear vibrant cz pendanti have the stud cz earrings and they are just as amazingi have many diamonds and i will not be spending hundreds on them anymorefrom now on its zirconias from now on ..will def purchase again and againi just made another purchase as a birthday gift !!!love, love, love them
177443	i bought this 1.50 carat sterling silver solitaire pendant top quality cubic zirconia for my sister for christmas it didn't came with a chain i had to buy separate it's very nice sparkles like a diamond ,great quality for low price.
177446	this is a very nice pendant, as one reviewer described. but when i opened the package i was surprised. it is definitely not the size stated and looks to be maybe .75 ct. the opening is too small for the complimentary necklace they sent to go with it. i am grateful for the necklace and may be able to use it for something else, but i have nothing that would fit for this tiny tiny opening on this pendant. nothing can possible fit in there to put a necklace of any size through it without taking the loop off the end of the necklace and reapplying it somehow after you fit it into the opening of the pendant. it is much smaller than the description, i am afraid, even though the stone itself has sparkle and is very pretty. i am sorry to say it but it is the truth. i ordered two of them and they were both the same.
177465	shipped quickly and securely. pendent is a top quality cz.  just the right size to wear with a t-shirt and jeans or a black dress. classy and feminine.
177588	i bought these for my great niece who is going through socks like crazy.  she's not quite 7 months old, but has big feet (closer to 9 month size).  i guess she got her daddy's feet.  according to her parents these fit.  we'll see how long it takes her to outgrow them.  nice bright colors too.  i would recommend them.
177603	"i like the color, and it softened after 1 wash. not much color fade, i might add.the product instruction was lacking, so i went on youtube and found severaluseful instruction on shemag wrapping/wearing, as well as tips.you can google: ""how to tie shemagh 7 methods military civilian revised ed""and get yourself informed. it seems like a good idea to buy a couple and use them together.still i'm not clear about how to wash it, and i think it shrinks quite a bit.i wish the shemag could have been much larger, so i have an ample of cloth to do the wrapping,but it will do for now."
177606	feels like it was woven from a cactus. its terrible. the ends are not tied, it sure as hell isn't cotton. its this wiry, whiskery material. its not comfortable, its way too thin, and the color is off. hard to tell which of these companies sells decent ones or not, but this one sucks
177610	i now where this scarf more often than i don't where it. i love it so much i'm going to buy a back up. i will wear this scarf out quickly. i'm getting plenty of compliments on it as well. buy it and enjoy!
177683	love this top, very comfortable on and true to fit.the beige/tan color is so true to the picture and the fabric is soft.can't beat the price!
177696	i have worn it once and have already received compliments on it.i love the color and tesxure of the shirt.
177708	i like bella and like this sort of flowy, dolman style top in general.  but i didn't love this top.  i'm petite and slim, but with a large bust (32dd).  i ordered the small and it was somehow ill-fitting.  the hip area gets loose quickly and the top opening is so wide that bra straps end up showing.  i'm not into the 80's, one-shoulder look but that's what inevitably results.  the material is soft, but overall an unflattering top.
177712	it is a little small and is much shorter than pictured. so i guess chosing a size up would have been wiser...
177719	i bought this shirt in large and i'm a medium. it runs a little small, more like juniors sizing but fits great. the material is very soft and not cheap feeling. the way it drapes over the body is very feminine and easy to dress with. it's great with yoga pants or jeans with heels. not quite long enough to wear with leggings though.
177729	i love this. it's so comfortable. i think the color is great on this too. i wear a tank under it. i think it's so comfortable. with it was wider around the bottom due to arriving all my weight on my stomach but it does stretch.
177757	these are great boots.  i wear then all day at work and longer with zero problems.  very comfortable.  i initially bought them in black and loved them so much i bought them in brown.the only shoe i've found more comfortable is merrell.  but, they don't have as many styles that look good in the office.a follow-up:  i found that the shine on the backs of the heels wore off quite quickly.  i think this is from driving.  i have a manual transmission and have to use both feet; hence there is wear on both booties.  the boots still look great for work....except for that.  i will have to figure out how i can repair the damage; perhaps by polishing.
177770	i really liked the style, am very pleased with them.  as always &#34;clarks&#34; never let me down.  pretty nice looking!!!!
177787	i tried on several nursing bras....either there wasn't any lining/padding, too much padding or you couldn't fold down the cups in order to pump. i'm a 36g and this bra proves needed support with out heavy padding. i don't &#34;show/peak&#34; through after pumping and you can't see any lines from pads or anything. the underwire is super flexible, i haven't had any issues with mastitis (big concern for me and underwire). at first i was resistant to underwire, and bought non wire bras....but they just don't have the support. mesh helps &#34;air&#34; out the cups too, no sweat gets trapped underneath. ended up buying 3 of these.
177841	a little disappointing considering how nice the men's were but it's okay. they washed well and are soft, just not happy with the fit.
177865	this is an excellent wallet.  it has more than enough space for all my cards and a separate compartment for money.  i bought the blue one and i like the way it looks.  i am very happy with my purchase.
177892	i bought this for my husband to wear to work. he is often outside in the cold. i expected the standard cotton waffle material with this thermal. however, that was not the case. the material is soft almost like a dri-fit. my husband likes it very much and says it keeps him warm.
177937	"it's perfect for around the house or on the dance floor. the butt 'slit' isn't as classic as a flap, but it's still pretty good. the material and buttons are quite nice. the red color looks good. overall i consider it one of the better pieces in my wardrobe.i told amazon it ""fit as expected"" because i had much more to say. i am male, 5'9"", and 165 pounds, supposedly pretty average proportions, yet i need to buy most clothes in small and slim fit to get something that isn't baggy. this size 'small' is short on me (especially in the torso), and wider in the middle than it needs to be, despite the arms and legs being very snug. had i ordered the medium, it would have been way too big in the middle. the 'small' seems accurate in terms of height, but will not be that complementing to a somewhat short person who is in shape. this is the opposite of what i expected having read some of the reviews. i feel like i made the right choice overall, but it's interesting that i both want the thing to be slimmer in the middle, maybe a tad bigger for the limbs, and taller: even though i would consider this final version appropriately labeled 'medium' in size.maybe next time i'll try a medium, but have it tailored. i need to look good when i hit the club."
177991	"i'm 6'2"" and 230 lbs and always an xl in everything i wear... but....make sure to read the sizing chart and not by what size you always get - i ordered the large and they fit perfectly in length and waist with room to lose or put on a few pounds without worry about the waistband getting to loose or tight (i'm a 34/34). just in time for winter so i look forward to staying warm on those cold days.update 11/25/13:just purchased 2 more pair as these are fantastic under the blue jeans on these 28-32 degree mornings plus regulates the heat as the day warms up. i'd give them 6 stars if i could!!"
178052	i bought these for my bachelorette party thinking i'd probably only wear them for that one thing, but i love them!  they are way comfier than they look (a little higher than i'm used to, though) and they are bright neon pink!  they're really great.  perfect and reasonably priced.
178054	they are perfect! i searched for the longest time for shoes of this tone and style! they look gorgeous, elegant and classy
178063	steve madden can be hit or miss both in size and quality for me, but these boots are perfect all-around. i wear between a 9.5 and a 10 most days, leaning towards the 9.5 in round toe shoes, but in these boots, the 10 fit perfect. they are wide enough and comfortable enough to support my feet without causing that intense, stabbing, throbbing pain we all know happens in boots when you have bunions. they are more comfortable than my frye boots, which after about the 5th or 6th hour begin to cause bunion pain. they have a modest to non-existent arch support, so you may want an insole for that, but i didn't need one and i have very high arches. the leather is good quality and supple around the ankle, requiring no breaking in for that area. it is more firm around the vamp and toe area, for better protection presumably, though these wouldn't work as a work boot for you (in that way). they'll last, look great, and work with jeans, leggings, and tights. order a half size up for width and comfort.
178068	this product is as described, of good quality, arrived in time, not over packaged and worth the price..my man was very, very pleased. the color was very rich.
178099	this jersey material is so soft!  the dress just feels amazing when you put it on.  the pros dont end there, though!most off-the-shoulder items i've purchased require being repeatedly yanked down to stay in place.  this dress is not designed that way - you will never have to pull the shoulders down!  that makes the dress even more comfortable.the sleeves are long, as depicted and the dress hits me just below the knees.  i'm 5'6&#34; and 135lbs.  i ordered a medium (i'm normally a small) and it fits well.  i have larger hips and the tailoring of the dress allows for room in that area.the color is exactly as pictured.
178118	the fit was just as i expected, i'm 5&#34;7&#34; @ 125 pounds and i ordered a small. the quality of the fabric is also great, it's really soft, comfortable and warm.
178199	i had hoped these would be pretty and provide full coverage.  they are definitely pretty.  i like that they come in a pack of 12 and the colors are rich jewel colors. the lace looks nice but be careful less you put a finger through it and rip it.  they actually do provide full coverage if...  now there is a big if.  they do provide full coverage if you get the right size.  not knowing the manufacturer makes that tricky.  do they run small or large compared to what you normally wear?  well, for me, i would normally get a large to make sure i cover all the junk in the trunk, even though i'm not an especially large person.  however, for this manufacturer, the large fits a little snug on me.  not tight, just snug.  they are comfortable but these are not shape wear.  also, while the lace in the back feels ok and doesn't ride up (and i suspect it would feel better had i ordered the extra large), the lace in the front rolls up when i sit down.  i'm not going to return them because i like the colors, they feel ok, and i can wear them.  however, these will be worn under jeans or khakis, or other clothes of a heavier material where i won't be concerned about how the rolled up lace may be visible in the front.
178220	i would say that for the xl a size 7 panty (usa) would be as large as you could be and still look like the picture. i wear a size 8 and bought the xl and they fit and are cute , but do not look like the picture. ( front comes up higher than back)  i am still happy with my purchase . i did not receive all the colors shown and feel disappointed in that.edited to add: i have washed the panties  ( in washer) on delicate /tap water.  i let them air dry but believe i could have used my  delicates  setting on the  dyrer.  they did very well.  so far the lace has not ripped and the panty is intact. for sure care must be taken with these panties . i have seen panties that looked just like this at the dollar type stores, so for those of you who really love them- check out the dollar type stores.  you will be surprised at the quality of underwear they  stock.
178255	as always with clarks, these riding boots are very comfortable. they are nearly wide enough, but since they are real leather they needed some breaking in. they have turned out to be fairly comfortable for long wear. i love the style with the buckle on the side and the nubuck cuff. these are definitely my &#34;go to&#34; boots in the wintertime. definitely recommend!
178272	i purchased this boot @ dsw in black and because they are so comfortable, perfect heel height and the style is good too, i had to find these in brown. thank you amazon for locating this boot in my color and size. ladies you can't go wrong wtih this boot. i wish it came in a wine color or camel. i would buy those colors too.the calf circumference is approx. 16&#34; so it's good for those with athletic legs and/or if you want to wear your pants inside the boot.
178286	i was looking forward to the arrival of this rash guard but was greeted with a disgusting item.  there are lots of dotted stains in the front logo.  disgusting!  it looked like it was kept in storage for several years!  i wish i could post a pic here but i do not know how.
178288	overall, it's a good shirt. however, looking at the model, and then getting a slightly larger size so it won't be as tight like it is on the model, you'll find that the model is actually wearing something that is 2 sizes smaller than her usual size. i'm usually an m, but bought the big to have a looser fit, based on how the model looked in her keri shirt, but it turned out huge on me.
178289	the look and fit is nice, but mine was defective. but amazon solved that issue. if u are 1.61 and wants tight fit, get m, loose fit, get l.
178301	at this point, my husband has worn these new shoes, i have, and even our young daughter has escaped into the backyard with them.  they are durable, easy to clean and i love the color.  so cheerful!  we have a pond that requires a lot of maintenance.  this shoe serves it's job well!
178435	clean and simple sneaker that is quality. give them a few wearings to break in a little bit to get rid of the snug fit.
178439	i bought this shirt in two different colors for my boyfriend. shipment was on time and the clothes fit nicely. there were many comments i read about the material being thin, it is thin but it is made very nicely. i really love this style it reminds of some men's shirts i had seen in old navy before. overall, i'm very pleased with this order :)my boyfriend is 5'10&#34; and 185lbs - athletic build.i ordered him a large and the length was perfect. they weren't tight across the chest or anything either.
178497	the problem i have with these is if you move your head around, then the band in the back moves, which affects how the ear warmers sit on your ears.  i tried expanding it to try to get the band to not be against my 7-1/2 size head, but that didn't work.  if you don't move your head (which isn't practical), then these are great.as far as the quality of the product, it's top notch.  it's just the design that i don't like, which, granted, seems to be popular.  if you like to keep your ears warm in this fashion, then i can't imagine you wouldn't like this product.  however, i would recommend trying either a headband or separate ear covers to keep your ears warm.
178560	my favorite charm on my pandora bracelet! fits my pandora bracelet fine and shows support for autism! my son is autistic and anyone who has someone in their life with autism would certainly enjoy it!
178588	this is a beautiful necklace! i'm always getting compliments on it, everywhere i go. i highly recommend it to anyone who loves owls and loves colors!
178601	this dress went back right away, thankfully there was no return shipping charge! this dress is so poufy with the ruffles and outside sheer lace material that it made me look huge! looking back at the model in the picture, i suppose if you posed exactly like she is with alot of excess material bunched up in the back and no one seen your backside, you may be able to pull off a night out in this dress. you would get real sore holding your butt out like she is with your hands on your hips though.... glad to have ordered from amazon and had the choice to return.
178637	i wanted a deep-v neckline and long sleeves, and amazon found me a bunch. this one has a superb fit, light as air, and makes every move i make effortless and free. washes easily and comes out wrinkle-free, a boon for me since i refuse to wear anything that needs ironing. the extra-long length stays put when i'm reaching and lifting, i've ordered them in  half a dozen colors to go with everything i wear.
178672	these were really big for my face but they will be great throw away's at the river this year. if i lose these, i wont be too upset!
178748	it flips aroud a bit but i really love the look of the it. to keep it from moving around i just flilp it on backwards after i put it on and it stays i twist it a little.
178863	these are the best rain boots for toddlers. they are lightweight, flexible and easy for my 2 year old to put on herself. she did so multiple times and seems to love wearing them, which tells me they are comfortable. they are also easy to clean and very durable. she gets compliments every time she wears them. you can't beat a bright pair of pink rain boots on a cute little girl!
178873	this is our second pair of croc rain boots. the first pair were the original version with the stripe on the side- my daughter was able to wear them for 2 years before they got too small, then i ordered a second pair in this new style. they must be comfy because of that crocs foot-bed and being so light weight because she wants to wear them all the time just like she did with the other ones.a word about sizing- both times i have ordered a size or two larger so that they will last longer and, despite the fact that my daughter has a super narrow foot, they have not fallen off or been too big. so i think you can size up.
178908	i'm normally a size 10 or 11 womens depending upon what shoe i'm wearing. i have had crocs for years, and i purchased a 10 (women's 10, men's 8)  like i did years ago. well, these are a bit exact. i'm sure it will stretch and i wanted something to wear now, too lazy to go and return it, but if i were in a store i'd get a size 9/11.it does have a squeeky feel. i don't remember any of my crocs feeling this way (as if some kind of waxy material is put on) but i'm sure because it's new. just need to break them in.
178951	i want a simple black flat and this is just right.  i would have liked it in a flat black but the shiny black will work.
178966	i love the look and especially the color of these shoes. not a glaring silver color, more muted. i did return them, only because they were a bit too narrow for me. otherwise they would be just what i wanted to wear with grey especially.
178971	i'm 6' tall, with a 34&#34; - 35&#34; inseam, right on the verge between plus size and the upper range of normal sizes.  these socks go well over my knee, so on a shorter woman i'm guessing they would go mid-thigh just as shown.  on me, the band over the knee is a bit tight (again, i'm plus size-ish), so i just fold the top over until they are normal knee socks, which is also cute (i like the color contrasts).they're just as pictured, cute vivid rainbow stripes.  cute socks - perfect for a halloween costume, roller derby uniform, sassy at-home play with your partner.  whatever, it's all good :)
178973	these socks are just as described and i got them right away. i ended up not needing them at the time, but i'll find a use for them yet.
179023	it had stayed shiny and in shape. it is really comfortable to wear. i paired it with a cz band and it looks really nice. actually this ring looks nicer than the cz band.
179037	very nice ring but the width was a little too thin for my taste so i got the same ring in 4mm and like it very much.i bought it for $0.99 but the s&h; was $9.99 ~~very clever, so of course i didn't return it at my expense to bereimbursed for less than a dollar.  but que sera~sera.  no worries! :d
179079	if you are going to be oing a lot of walking in them wear some socks-they rub so i had blister on the top of my right foot. they also feel as if you are walking barefoot-not a lot cushion -can feel all the rocks if you are walking thru a gravel parking lot.
179089	i ordered this shirt, it was delivered and i was very disappointed! i wasn't what appeared on the website. it wasn't off the shoulder like it was shown on the picture. it wasn't like anything that was shown in the picture. i asked that they credit my account.
179106	i have already purchased at least 4 of patty's tops so far--so you know i love her tops. this style looked so cute, but when i got it, the material was way thinner than the others,(and that's thin) my bra even showed thru--it was way too tight around me. i checked to see if it was my size--it was. i even weighed myself and i was the same weight as always. the measurement was about 2 inches smaller around than my other tops by patty. the length was right but this quality was something like k-mart sells. please up your quality of the fabric,(if even a little) and make sure they are all measured correctly by size, patty. we all work hard for our money and sending it back would come to around $7 or more. i'm so disappointed.
179153	this vest is well made, nice design. i am 157lbs and usually wear medium but this didn't fit quite the way i wanted it to. i sold it and ordered another, hopefully the small will fit better.24th november: so i got the small in this vest, its still a bit large i think i could have actually pulled off an extra small. i have very small boobs (a cup) i guess thats why this vest runs so large for me.
179158	i was head over heels with patty's products at the time of this purchase. the color was perfect, but the ruffles gave this blouse a clown look. it looks much better underneath a sweater or jacket.
179268	i am now looking for a slip to go under this dress, preferably a black body shaping slip with a fitted bust (to match the bustline of the dress). or i could just wear it as is with underwear, and not care that the underwear are visible. the dress is pretty enough that i am keeping it regardless.
179324	nine west rarely disappoints. the quality is always great & the style is hittin! since i love wedges these are definitely going into rotation. i have them in 3 colors. the colors look sort of dull on the amazon picture but they are actually very rich & vibrant with the perfect leather shine (not glossy). i wear a 12 and the size & width is perfect (as ususal with 9west). be careful...these are tall so walk cute & careful!
179468	bought for a christmas gift, but was told she loves her dansko but needs to break in beacuse they are a little uncomfortable when new
179532	i purchased these shoes in the metallic off white. they look gold. also, i have narrow feet and they're a little narrow for me... they aren't that comfortable either. :-(
179542	i received this scarf early considering i used the free shipping method.  i had so much anticipation while waiting for my scarves to arrive and am i thrilled about this scarf!!the light/dark pink mixture with the cheetah print is gorgeous. i have already received so many compliments on the scarf. one said &#34;you look so feminine today...&#34; uh is that supposed to be a compliment?back to the scarf, the length is exactly what i imagine it to be (ok it did list out the actual length). the fringes are cute. it is soft and extremely warm next to my neck. i live in the nw and even though it is supposed to be low 60s, let me tell you that temperature doesn't get up there until 5pm.  if it is a cloudy day, then the cool temperature is stuck for pretty much the whole day.i have a light neon greenish color long sleeves on today. add the scarf, it brightens up my skin color and makes me look well rested and refreshed. it also gives me a light glow.  the scarf itself really stands out as well.so far i am very pleased with this scarf. i definitely recommend this scarf to anyone.  hopefully i will have more good luck in the future in picking out a scarf as this one.
179546	i wanted the perfect pair of ankle boots for wearing with vintage dresses. these were very comfortable and looked great. they looked and felt high-quality. the black was priced higher than the burgundy and out of my boot budget (hey, a girl's gotta try) so i gave the burgundy a whirl. the back zipper is prominent, but i liked the way the burgundy blended with the gold-tone zipper. in the black it looked too prominent for me. the zipper did make noise when i walked around the house, so if that would be an issue for you (cat burglar?) you may want to look elsewhere. my husband found the zipper's unusual placement sexy. in the end, i decided i really did want a black boot, so i went with the lucky tablita and am very pleased. if you are searching for a boot with this look, these are great boots. i am a 7.5m.
179574	i am 5'10&#34; and dress is long enough and fits good. the material is very comfortable, but it does stretch pretty easily.
179622	"this top arrived super-fast and in 4 days i already had it. i'm 5'8"", my measures are 36-28-37 and it fits nice and quite flattering. the sleeves are long as pictured, which i like. the only disappointing thing about this top is that in reality the grey color is much darker than in this pic. here it looks like grey-brown. maybe it depends upon the monitor, but anyway i expected it to be not that dark. apart of that it's perfect."
179623	i'm really happy with this purchase.  its true to size.  i wear mine with jeans and gray clogs and it looks fab!  the material is good quality.  its a run between jersey knit & sweater.  the sleeves are extra long which i love & looks like most other posters do as well.  it arrived it exactly one week, the same amount of time as my other items from amazon.  it was neatly packaged.  i generally wear a size 10 so i bought an xl to be safe but i couldve def worn a regular l.  mines a little baggy/loose so i know the l would've been perfect.  i've never purchased from this seller so i figured from other posts the size would run small and i hate my clothes tight and sometimes shirts run short.  this was a great shirt for the money & i won't hesitate to purchase from patty again!
179664	it runs large in the bust area; otherwise, it flatters the figure and is perfect for an evening on the town.  what i like most is the length.  it's hard to find dresses of this length.  most are either &#34;above the knee,&#34; or &#34;to the ground.&#34;
179698	these do what they are intended to do but they are so baggy that they look sloppy.  not an attractive look.
179701	i have worn new balance running shoes for 8 years so i was confident with the size i would need. i wear a size 7 in regular shoes, sometimes even a 6.5, but wear a new balance 8 2a as i have narrow feet. these weren't available in a narrow width, but the medium width seems particularly wide and the size 8 is small, my toes are almost to the end of the shoe. they're rather masculine looking as well. gonna have to think about whether to keep them or send them back.
179751	shoe has weird build...did not feel right on foot.  returned.  cute, but small in odd places and large in others.  also, did not like the &#34;fur&#34; lining.  returned.
179760	this is a very well made shoe. quality materials, very comfortable and super cute too.that being said, there are a couple issues i feel i should mention.1) they seem to run a bit big. i am always a size 6, which is what i ordered. these have a bit too much room in the toe box, the sides pooch out a bit when i walk, and my heel keeps slipping out the back. i don't know that a smaller size would work, it's not that far off, so i'm keeping them and dealing.2) these shoes do &#34;elongate&#34; your foot a bit, the front is not blunt, more longish. i'm pretty shrimpy and have little feet, so it's not an issue for me, but i have many tall friends, and i know that taller women sometimes are a bit &#34;uncomfortable&#34; with their shoe size and wouldn't want their feet looking longer/bigger.overall i really like the shoe, just a bit bummed it doesn't fit a little better, although it's very comfortable.
179781	the boots are for next winter so i cannot say too much about them at this point. my daughter likes them and they seem practical (warm and waterproof).
179866	seriously the price cannot be beat! i bought the 10 pack and now i wish i got the 25! i love my set i got, you get a cute&fun array of colors and designs and no doubles! i've lost quite a few rings over the years and at about .50 a ring why wouldn't anyone buy a pack? definitely recommend!
179891	ok so these are nice because they're plastic, and if you're sensitive to metals like me they really come in handy. the only thing that's weird about them is that sometimes they don't have enough structure to actually go through the piercing hole, they just kind of bend and wimp out. other than that they're really nice and i only got one repeat in the whole batch.
179905	i was worried that id get broken ones from most the negative reviews. but nope! not one was broken. only downside of these, they're kinda ugly & there were doubles. boringgg. the only one i liked broke in my sleep
179950	"i ordered one pair, because i was not sure about the fit. when they arrived i was very pleasantly surprised! i am 5' 10"" and i was sure they would be too short. i was wrong! these jeggings are plenty long enough so that they actually bunch up some when they touch the top of my foot. they are super soft and very very comfortable. in the photo they look like they fit like hip huggers, but on me they sit just below my waist-line. these are comfortable enough that i was able to wear them for 16 hours of driving to florida. only wish they had more colors available. i will definately order more in different colors, when they re-stock my size."
179963	"these aren't jeggings and they aren't leggings and they aren't jeans.  they are an amalgamation of all three. styled like a jean, they are made of really soft, thick (winter-weight) stretchy, cotton-blend fabric.  i bought the plum purple color thinking it would be more of an aubergine, but instead it's more of a very saturated, rich dark purple--which i think is attractive, especially since i hate the color purple.  they are a great color for breaking up the all-black look i tend to fall back on when i don't want to think about styling an outfit. i usually wear a 10 so i bought size large. i'm 5'7"" 138 lbs with very long legs. they run big! if you're between sizes, definitely order down. i will be ordering the other colors i plan to buy in a medium these are just the right full length (they cover my ankle) but they easily roll up to capris. . they are very stretchy and they lose their shape a bit after the first wearing, but i was able to get two wears out of them.  the tag says dry clean only or hand wash, but i washed mine in cold water (front loader) and line-dried them with no shrinkage and no ironing. i must however wear them with a belt or they fall down.  i love the fit--not as skin-tight as a jegging and not thin like a legging, these are fitted through the thighs/knees but they don't strangle your ankles. they are substantial enough to wear on their own but are fitted enough to wear under a short dress or tunic without looking bulky.  and best of all, they arrived beautifully packaged in pink tissue paper with a little note saying thanks for the purchase and a coupon for $'s off my next purchase.  excellent delivery and that extra touch was well-appreciated.  it made it feel like i was unwrapping a gift.  classy."
179997	this is a very attractive bracelet. it is a generous size and is rugged-looking, perfect for men. sadly, the construction of it is the weak point. the braid is held together merely by wrapping cord around it. this does loosen up and fall apart, causing the bracelet to fall apart. this weakness may be strengthened by applying a little glue to the wrapped around section. i hope that does solve the issue, because this is a very attractive bracelet!
180102	these pants are different than most scrubs, they have a soft texture and a soft feel to them. they are like wearing your comfy pants.  i needed to order dickies brand to match the scrub shirt i had but i also love the soft scrub. i looked at other websites and found that these were priced the best.  customer service with this company is great.  would definitely order from medically equipped again.
180121	i received this yesterday. it is a very pretty necklace.  it is alittle darker purple than i thought. i plan on exchanging it for the pinkone just like it. it is well made, and very comfortable to wear. it looks expensive.
180126	very nice. far prettier in person than in this photo. strong and bold setting. will hold up very well. nice onyx and well cut. totally smooth and polished, no edges to catch on knits. this ring will last a lifetime and be around to be passed on. i was actually impressed. it's my first stainless steel ring and i will look for more stainless steel rings. don't hesitate. this is thick and large however so if you must have a ring that is slim on the sides where it hits between the fingers, this will not suit you.
180134	this is an odd fit, it seems a little too small, not very comfortable at all, and it doesn't look the same as pictured
180151	these are not bad for the price they fit snug however i don't believe these are one size fits all ,i am 5&#34;7 and 119 pounds and they just fit the other down fall is i wouldn't dry them they would shrink so i washed them in delicates and laid flat to dry i did order another pair i like the bow on the back the best .of course these aren't your daily pair of underwear they wouldn't last and i doubt they will last many washings but for the price i wont complain.
180157	these are so tiny, no way they fit a petite female, unless she's a 5 year old girl size. ripoff!!!
180163	these panties are tiny!!!!! the pic is misleading because the lace is not that wide. no one over a size 5 (us size) should wear these. these are certainly made for our asian sisters. :)
180172	size is accurate, wife loves them.  they look great, hard to believe how cheap the price is.as for sizing again, if you live the &#34;obese lifestyle&#34; you may want to stick with granny panties, these will not fit you.  they are made for healthy size women (normal weight).
180174	a size zero will fit these or yes like other reviews a small child.  i didn't even try.  i'm gonna give them to a tiny thai girl i know.  other than that very nice!
180276	ordered sz l for son, 6'2&#34;, 185lb & very fit.  he loved the fit & feel of this shirt - & he is picky!  also ordered the same looking t-shirt, russell athletic v-neck t - which he said was inferior to the next level v neck t!!!
180328	fit true to size. the black says vintage black but it's like a charcoal grey black. it is soft. very comfortable. would buy more.
180343	i love this shirt.  i wear a small and this fit perfect.  it's form fitting but not too tight and the neckline is perfect.  i've bought a couple more in different colors.  i really like the triblend effect as well.
180354	the fabric is more sheer than it appears to be in the photos and the arms are too long. it will work for my purposes so i will keep it.
180360	my daughter is 9 but tall with long arms, i bought this in a large because other brands are usually too small for her. she complained this one was too big, but i'm happy with that because every other undershirt i've bought her has been too small and now she's got one to grow in to.
180403	love the color but you can never seem to get a size right when you order off the internet. ive washed it in hot and cant get it to shrink
180422	a very nice necklace for the money. unfortunatly i had to return mine. it was way shorter than the advertised length. amazon sent me another necklace but that also was a shorter length. i sent both back. i wanted a long necklace not a short one.this was a frustrating ordeal for me!
180491	i loved these boots, alas, they are going back because they are just too small.after reading multiple reviews suggesting buying the w size or a half size larger, i did just that.  i normally wear 11 m and rarely have issues with shoes/boots fitting.  even after  ordering an 11w, they still did not fit...and not just a little.  they felt like a size 10 - too tight in the toe, and could not zip it more than 1/2 way.  even if i could have zipped them, they would have been uncomfortable and not allowed room for even thin socks.unfortunately, 11w is the largest available size.  i'll have to keep looking for a boot that fit!
180493	"i came from parents with no junk in the trunk. so it was inevitable that despite years of step aerobics and running (in addition to weight lifting) that i too would have nothing back there. i hated all that sagging material in the back of my pants. recently, one ""kind"" friend said to me ""you really have no ass!"" and sadly she's right.  but these trunks have changed that. no one has said a word, not sure they have even noticed. but i can tell you that the padding fills up the backseat material of my pants nicely without looking like a shelf to place drinks. i think the look is very natural and has boosted my confidence (like when i got braces as a kid to correct a crooked smile). i  wear size 30 underwear and got the small; it was  bit tight though it really pushes out your junk in the front if you like that sort of thing. the second go round i bought medium and they are more comfortable for me."
180530	i wear size 11, but these boots make my feet look like size 8 or 9. they are supercute and comfy. they have warm lining, and wearing them is a total pleasure. one more thing, the yellow color is not brigth yellow, but of a very nice subdued shade.  i can wear them with almost any color.  just perfect!
180543	these pants are the same pants i got from walmart last year for $18! they are so not worth anything more!
180599	this was a gift from my husband it is a beautiful color but size is all wrong i could not move enough in it to be able to get on and off no give in garment and so sad  description and product is not even close to a match don't waste your money.
180604	at first i was disappointed as i wear a 14 or large in most sizes and going with the chart i ordered an xxlarge,  my body has never been a standard size so having this fit wrong all over i was not overly surprised and returned it.  i was contacted  and they offered to have a shirt custom made to fit my body size for no additional cost.  i took them up on it and not only is it lovely but it fits.  what more can i ask.those that say it is thin are correct but this is a summer shirt not a winter shirt.
180630	this purse has very great stitching comes with little teddy bear jewelry and has great weight distribution for people with back problems. the teddy bears can be removed if say you're young one is growing up fast and wants to remove it. purse that's made for your daughter will likely become mom's purse due to the fact that it's better than her purse.
180631	fab purse. i started getting compliments immediately after i began carrying the purse.  everyone loves the teddy bear fobs and the color is perfect for fall/winter.  i want more from this collection
180645	so they aren't the most comfortable or superbly made, but they look awesome and for the price, who is gonna complain! i love the style of this shoe, if only it was a wee more comfortable, but again, for the price, i can buy an insert and be happy as a clam.
180680	this shoe is classy with a little sassy.  they are true to size and comfortable for a long day at the office
180713	i knew this was a tunic style sweater, but i'm 5'7&#34; tall and a medium size came to just above my knees; way too long for me.  trying to fold or cinch it up higher just made it look awful as it's a form-fitting cut.  if it wasn't for the excess length, i'd had kept it.  the material is very soft, warm, and comfortable and the design was very flattering.
180720	"omg this sweater is wonderful. i am ordering another immediately. fits like a dream. i purchased a medium. i'm 5'9"" with athletic build and this sweater with leggings looks hot!"
180727	i bought these thinking the wide width will be good enough. i was wrong, they are still too tight for my foot. just putting them on is a task since there like a sock. don't get me wrong these might do well for someone that have no arch and width of their foot is a d which is the norm. these aren't made for a person with a wide foot. i can only get my foot in it with out wearing a sock even at that the area were you start to loop the laces is way too tight for my comfort.
180749	i bought this dress in brown, and it s is very see-through. it is also quite tight (i am a size 12 and bought large, and it's almost too tight to wear - guess i'd better finally get to losing those 10 pounds). on the plus side, the ruching at the waist helps to hide my &#34;mom&#34; stomach.
180754	my wife had some concern as the material texture exposes all the contours on her body. if you dont mind that, then its ok; otherwise this item should be worn with an internal wear.
180764	i bought this for my wife. i didnt expect much when i bought this. it looked very nice compared to the price i paid for. she worn it during our vacation to carribean recently. .
180773	i saw the dress and thought, i'm going to buy that.  well i'm sure glad i did.. its really lovely and fits perfectly!... shaped nicely around the shoulder and underarm,  and comfortable, will show off your figure beautifully, great cut/style, especially the back view!.. work it girls!.. really happy with my impulse buy... :)
180785	perfect fit, its cotton, and very well finish. i love it, could not get anything better for the price. great product. i recommended 100%.
180793	i got this is purple and the color is perfect! the detail on the sleeves is what got me and it is really pretty and will show off a summer tan.  will look good with flip flops for a casual dinner or with heels for something fancier.  wonderfully soft fabric!  great buy for the price!
180794	the turquoise i like. it's short but not so much that you have to keep pulling down. i'm 5' 4&#34; and 148lbs with a small bump at 35 weeks pregnant. i would have preferred a  thicker fabric but it worked. i'll probably be going to the beach next time i decide to wear it.
180832	i have a small chest. i ordered the smallest size available. i figured it should fit me. not even close. it would have taken some serious tailoring to get this dress to fit me. i would have had to have been like a dd to fill it in...even then, i am not sure if the straps would have fit properly?
180905	this shoe fits just perfectly.  it was bought for my mother who is in her 50's so she doesn't mind the style as she isn't into fashion as she used to be,  but she kept telling me how amazing they feel on her foot.  they are great for extended periods of walking....  and 'great' being an understatement(seconding to her)
180917	i got these at the end of winter...spring came and i started wearing my flip flops so i really haven't wore these very much. the few times i did, my little toe on my left foot hurt....i'm hoping they just need breaking in....they do look nice with jeans or slacks.update 4/46/14.... i wore them several times this past winter....still not my favorite, they look nice but make a noise with every step. they no longer hurt my little toe.
180942	i've worn naturalizers before and they are nice looking shoes, but they are not near the correct size. they run too long and too wide for an 8.5 narrow.  i will be returning them.
181003	these socks are adorable, with plenty of stretch to stay on tiny feet. they do look like socks with mary-jane style shoes. i made a dress, bonnet and bloomers for a first baby mom and these socks matched perfectly. the thank you note said she would treasure the outfit. i appreciate other positive feedback that helped me decide to buy these. it's all true, highly recommend these.
181034	i bought this dress for a formal new years eve party we are going to.  it fit perfect and really flatters my &#34;full figure.&#34;  i am 5'7 and when shopping at lane bryant will wear a size 18/20 and usually a 20 when shopping other places.  my least favorite attributes are my wide hips and belly but even without spanx i was impessed with the fit of this dress!  it really is a gorgeous dress and i was very impressed by the quality when it arrived.  my new &#34;little black dress&#34;!!!
181042	this dress does what it promises--flatters most any figure. i found the bodice to be a bit overpowering to my short frame--something about the lovely wide straps, i think. but, the fabric never wrinkles and hangs beautifully. the length is good. the dress would be great for dancing. the red is a true, cool red with blue undertones. it makes a bold statement. the black dress would be a very good choice, an elegant look. the red is more saucy. i am currently trying a short, sheer white sweater with it to see if the shoulder-line looks better. if not, i'll have to return it, but i still recommend it. in this instance, i think i'm the anomaly, not the dress!
181075	saw these on  atl/pac blog and couldn't afford kw so these are totally awesome and nobody will know the wiser.  unique sunglasses that makes a statement.
181098	i have the shayna crocs and love them, so i had high hopes for these.  they were too short, my toes hit the ends, although the shaynas fit fine in the same size.  also, these have no ventilation, so just testing them out around the house, i got sweaty feet.  i had bought them for a disneyworld trip, so they won't do at all.  i can't imagine wearing them in the summer.
181176	bought the black at another online shoe place, won't mention their highly reputable name, also free shipping, but 30$ more!!!  these are fabulous high quality leather shoes.  i just had to have the brown also.  walked all day in them and not a problem at all.  nice heel height, not cfmp's, and they even have a leather cushioned insole!  buy here -- great deal, and buy them both!!  looks great with jeans, dress pants, or even a skirt.  more than five stars, a ten even!!  (:
181202	as typical of clarks shoes, these fit like a dream but i ordered them because they were described as being burgundy in color and that's what i needed.  unfortunately the pair that arrived are being returned because the color is far more brown than burgundy in my opinion.  i wanted to wear them with a black dress but since they actually look like they're dark brown, they just aren't right.
181228	i don't own a single pair of high heeled boots, (i usually wear flats or slouchy boots when i need to dress up), but when i saw these i had to get them. i've been looking for an edgy-looking brown leather boot for a long time, but nothing really caught my eye except frye boots. i couldn't justify spending $300+ on a pair of shoes, so i decided to keep looking. i ended up buying these but knew almost instantly that the heels were too high. i wore them out one night and had to take them off after about an hour; it felt like i was walking on my tippy-toes all night. i'm still debating about whether to send them back or not, because they're just so darn cute and versatile. they're literally perfect in every way except for the height! if they were just an inch or so shorter i would wear them all day, every day.
181318	these boots were stiff and rubbed by ankles uncomfortably--and i have skinny ankles.  also, they are not sized for winter socks.  i would have needed to go up a size for thicker socks.
181322	i really wanted to love this shoe.  i had read on z that they run short, so i ordered an 8m (my normal size is 7.5).  it fit quite nicely in the length, but was too narrow, so i sent it back and ordered the 8w.  this is quite comfortable when i'm sitting down.  unfortunately as soon as i stand up my feet pronate even more than usual; i feel like i'm walking on the inside of my ankles.  i know merrell says there are tips and tricks to getting used to the barefoot style, but i'm a little worried that i'd go through the effort and then, once the shoes were unreturnable, find that they just weren't for me.  so i'm sending them back and looking for something with a little more stability.
181347	these boots are gorgeous, versatile, and comfortable. unfortunately, my calves are too thin for them. if you have average sized calves, these boots are perfect. they do run about a half size large, though.
181355	alright, so i read so many of the reviews on here about these boots. i was so confused whether these are wide calf or for skinny legs. some said they fit at 16&#34; calf and some said they were tight. some say the ankle is so tight they couldn't get their foot in. i ordered these hoping the wide calf reviewers were right. turns out, nobody got the same pair of boots!i think merrell made these in wide calf before but are not just regular 14&#34; size calf. i looked these boots up on 2 sites. one site said 16.5&#34; size calf and the other site said 14.5&#34; size calf. the pair i got is 14.5&#34; size.  i have 15&#34; calves and these barely zipped up and now way will fit over skinny jeans. if you have bigger calves do not buy these. the reviewers that have 16&#34; calves that fit these must have gotten something different. i'm still on my search for 16&#34; wide calf boots that are comfortable and water proof.these are very nice quality, my ankle had no problem fitting in there at all, not tight around the ankle for me. i usually wear 7.5 to size 8 and the 8 fit me nicely in the foot area, just the calf is too tight. i would love these if they were truly wide calf boots. its sad that my legs are considered wide calf, my legs aren't huge looking.the ankle area is kinda stiff feeling when you put them on, but i'm sure they just need to be broken in. unfortunately i have returned mine do to the calf size, so i will not be able to give them a chance to be broken in. i wear boots strictly to wear over skinny jeans and if i can't fit them over my jeans they are no good to me.
181369	new balance sneakers were recommended to me by my doctor. this is the first one i tried that was not big and bulky but sleek and stylish. its comfortable. i wore them all day without pain or feeling tired. for many of my shoes that just doesn't happen. good quality. definitely can be used in summer because you can feel the breeze through the top of the shoe. buy them
181376	did not fit me right sent back.  however a beautiful shoe. just was not the right style for me. that's. it.
181397	these were great shoes for school.  easy on and the great quality of saucony.  will be buy the bigger size for next year.
181487	item fits, but the material pills up after a handful of washings, overall for the price not bad.  i would not purchase it again unless its dirt cheap on close out.
181616	i had high expectations for this dress, but the fit was bad and the material was bad. i felt like i was an old tablecloth. it was less rockabilly and more dukes of hazard. not pleased.
181654	my nephew looks darling in this onesie.  he's one month old and it's comfortably loose (size 0-3 mo)  not too loose, but i'm sure it will fit him for another month or two and then i'll have to buy a new onesie for him declaring his auntie's love for him. they grow so fast! :)
181663	lots of these water shirts are super small and clingy. i have a solid son.  he doesn't need clingy.  this shirt fits nice!
181781	the sunglasses rims were in poor condition and some of the metal was bent.  the lens are no where near red.  avoid.
181857	i bought this as a gift. she loves it. its cute. it's beautiful when the light hits it. yes. yes.
181873	i rarely rate boots this high but these deserve the rating.  first, the side zipper.  these boots are so well designed i can actually use just the zipper to take these on and off.  these are the the only boots, ever, that i can do that with.  that said, these are also very comfortable.  you have to work with the laces, then zipper, once or twice to get a good fit but once done the side zippers work (yes, i'm thrilled with them) the souls are rugged and grip both smooth and irregular surfaces.  i don't know how long these will last since they were so inexpensive, but if they only last a year i'll buy two more pairs anyway.  did i mention i like these boots?
181939	shoe runs wide (i have a narrow foot, ordered narrow) and the heel was too wide.  couldn't tighten the strap to try to compensate.  ( not really designed to tighten).  its a shame, i really liked the shoe.  nice insole padding, paced around the heel.  sad they have to be returned.
181962	i love the way these shoes fit. i have a wide foot. these shoes will be great for work and the cushioning feels great. i would reccomend this shoe.
182006	not as soft as it looks. color is good, there are two scratches on the surface. i gave it to my brother
182010	i have a high arch....and, these provide absolutely no arch support, nor any other kind of foot support!  the product description stated that these provide &#34;supportive comfort.&#34;  not even close.  there is but a thin wafer of what might be considered a &#34;cushioned&#34; sole.  i don't suffer from ball-of-foot problems.  yet, within an hour of wearing these, the balls of my feet began to hurt.  i'll give skechers this:  the shoes are incredibly light.....which explains why there is no foot support.
182023	these boots are awesome, i can't say enough about them. they do require some breaking in, especially in the heel area, where it feels like it will rub your ankle raw in a few steps. i wore them 5 hours one day, followed by a nine hour shift at work (standing the whole time), both times with 2pairs of socks, to protect my feet and ankles. they are now fully broken in and feel great, although they do expand and get slightly larger than they start out. the calf area also expands, so even though they weren't a great fit at first there, they work great now. i have never had a pair of non-sneakers that i could wear standing or walking in all day. these are fine, i could walk in the city all day long, stand for a 12 hour shift, anything. these boots feel solid and comfortable, as if they were custom made for me. buy them, you'll love them. i got these four days ago and i still get excited every time i look at them.
182030	i have no idea why they would advertised this pair as black when what i received was a dark green.. the color is not bad the problem is that i payed for black boots and that is what i wanted.. i have 2 more pairs of the triumph and i love them so much, but this particular purchase was not great :(. the quality seems very cheap and not as good as the other 2 pairs i own. i would not recommend this specific model to anyone or at least not this color.
182092	i've only had these shoes about a week, but wore them an entire day the first day i had them. they were comfortable all day plus, no hot-spots. i bought these for travel as i wanted something nicer looking than running shoes, but that would be comfortable for long sight-seeing days. these are my go-to shoes now unless i'm dressing for work. i am very pleased with my purchase.
182094	great design makes for a very comfortable walking shoe. these are my second pair and have no complaints. would recommend them to anyone.
182095	i could wear them out of the box with no &#34;break in.&#34; i walked over a mile in them immediately with no problems.
182102	i am always looking for good waterproof walking shoes since my job takes me outside all over the grounds.  these clarks wave trek oxfords are beautiful and well made with good arch supports.  they fit well but for walking on uneven ground the heel doesn't sit deeply enough and the outer sole is too narrow for good stability.  i had to send them back but will recommend for normal walking conditions.
182104	i love these shoes.  in fact i have loved all my clarks wave shoes.  i have noted however that this shoe runs narrow and i have had to order them in a wide.  2 years ago i paid 119.00 for these shoes, last week they were 59.88! :)perfect shoe for walking and working.so glad i found then at a reduced price.
182111	top quality in every respect.  beautiful leather, beautiful workmanship, beautiful design.  these are classy shoes!  they almost seem too fine to wear for every day walking, but, of course, that is what they are designed for.  and they provide excellent comfort and support.the &#34;red&#34; color is really a &#34;brick&#34; tone, and it is very good-looking.  i absolutely love these sneakers!!
182139	i bought this bead to remind myself of the beautiful waters of the caribbean! it does that and more. the color is beautiful and i love the water bubbles in it
182172	the material of the camisa is excellent, 100% finished, it is best to be at a good price, i recommend these camisa are great and do not weigh anything, are super comfortable.
182238	this top is awesome if your relaxing at home or for something to wear underneath shirts , fits wonderfully and overall im really happy with the product
182254	these tights and well made and surprisingly well fitting considering they're a one size item.  they are not leggings tho - they're semi sheer tights so your underwear will definitely show through.  also the band at the cuff is opaque while the rest of the fabric is rather sheer.  couldn't use them and not sure what to do with them now. someone may like them under a dress perhaps.
182272	omg these leggings are gorgeous!!! they come in any color you want and they fit perfectly and are so beautiful. just love them.
182294	of all the gemstones, pearls -classy and timeless - have forever been my favorites to present to the loves and infatuations of my life. intuitively, as a barely domesticated cro magnon, there is something about being in the company of a person adorned in an elegant strand that i hope will reflect upon me.  this set is neither extravagant in presentation nor excruciating in expense but it will be appreciated by anyone who receives it.the 40'' string is versatile as it can be arranged and worn in variety of styles. the larger cream colored pearls with somewhat of a rosy undertone off -round assortment, vary in size from approximately 6mm to 10mm. alternatively strung with much smaller irregularly shaped pearls that appear to have a deep taupe hue, to the naked eye most of the beads in this collection have easily discernible nacre surface markings or abrasions however i don't believe they significantly detract from the appeal of this accessory.  the oval shaped sterling silver clasp which has a locking safety clip is a little underwhelming as it appears to be surprisingly dull, closer to brushed steel than silver in my opinion.while overall luster may not be considered brilliant, there is a sheen that should be satisfactory for all but the most discriminating potential purchasers. the earrings feature a matching cream hued bead of about 9mm accompanied by two of the smaller taupe toned beads mounted on sterling silver hooks. the larger pearls of the earrings do not appear to have as deep a rose undertone as the necklace beads but that should not be a concern as the contrast is not clearly discernible unless the pieces are side by side.
182306	so, i was one of the people who got a faulty zipper.the dress, i ordered the white one with red and black designs.it fits great at my chest (34&#34;c). i ordered a size 6.however, the zipper as a fault point around the red sash. it's not too tight, but even when the dress is off me, if any tension is created at this one point, it will not zip.thankfully, the little opening it makes, when the top clasp is locked, isn't ugly. we're going to take a rhinestone and make a dangling jewel to fill in the space. i'd fix it, but since my hair is to my waist and i would only wear the dress if also wearing a shawl, it'll most likely go unseen most of the time. and when i showed pictures of the dress, front and back, no one could tell that the dress's zipper was stuck. they thought the dress was designed to have the opening in the back.so, i give it a 4 out of 5 stars. the fabric is lovely, very silky. it has a modesty piece around your lower regions too make sure it's covered, and has cups in the chest so you don't have to worry about whether or not it's cold outside.personally, i would order the size you are. just make sure to measure first. a lot of people complain about clothing not fitting, but a lot of the time women aren't fully aware of their real chest size. this isn't a bra, so it'll have a different fit, even if your bra, which may be the wrong size, works for you.measure twice, buy once. =d
182319	the blue color in the pictures was very close to the actual color. it was long, i am 5'8&#34; and wore 5 inch heels with this dress and it came just to the floor.  it was easy to step on going up and down stairs, but had great flow. it plunges deep in the back, so if you need to wear a bra, the bra strap will show.  there isn't enough padding in the chest area to prevent show throughs.
182381	i absolutely love the under armour shirts in this florida heat. the size is true, i didn't find it too big or too small. i ordered my size and it fits perfectly. i've washed it and it holds up really well through the washer and dryer. i really recommend these shirts for marathons, 5k's or just simple hot environments. i can go out and not have sweat marks on my back or arms because the shirt magically disappears it!
182474	first i'll start with i have dds so this may not apply to those who have smaller chests. when i tried on the dress it hung so low that it nearly exposed my nipples! the shoulder strap is a strap with small bows tied on it and i didn't like it all. i sent it back. also the color is much more purple than blue!
182492	love it.  i honestly can't be happier with this item.  it's made of nice quality material (though a little on the thin side, i have to admit) which isn't transparent, the cut is extremely flattering, and i've been able to pair it with just about everything!  it's my new favorite cardigan.  if i could get away with it, i'd probably get a second one in gray as well!
182517	love these cardingan, it's soft, elegant and make you slim.  the colour is shinny and you can wear it with a jeans and a simple t-shirt and look fabulous.
182546	i got this as a carrying bag for work. its not the best, but for the money it's great. has a small pocket on the outside and a small one inside.
182739	when my mother tried to put on my first pair of shoes i curled my toes and refused to co-operate.  after a great deal of effort she accomplished the task and i was shod.  from what i was told i only would look at my shod food and with a bellowing cry indicated that i wanted the shoes off!  i am now 77 and have always felt the same way as i did as an infant.  i can keep these shoes on all day and am not even aware that they are on my feet.  i really do love these shoes and i may never need to run barefoot again.
182811	cute shoe! fits perfect, very comfortable, light weight yet can keep your feet warm. overall happy with my purchase and would recommend for anyone looking for a casual slip on shoe.
182832	"i've been looking for some earrings like these and amazon has a fair selection from the very cheap to moderately priced.  i did some research and finally ordered these and another pair, that are currently sold out.  these came a few days ago and i was pleasantly surprised, considering the $10 price.  they are clear, sparkly crystals set in a whitish putty-like material, (which you can't really see unless you examine them with a magnifying glass), attached at the rear to a ""cupped"" post, as many of these earrings are.  the posts are silver and a little fragile but adequate, and i think are a bit long.  i would not sleep in these and have treated them gingerly.  so far, they have held up fine, though i've only worn them one day.to summarize, these appear to be adequately made, pretty, shiny crystal and silver post earrings.  they are a nice size, not too large and not too small, just basically covering my earlobe.  i really can't say how long they will last but i will update if i have any problems.  since there were no reviews i thought i'd put my 2 cents in to give you something to go by.  for the price, i am happy with my purchase."
182911	you know what? i don't care that my husband calls these &#34;hideous old lady doctor shoes&#34; because a) i think they are adorable and have a high quality appearance and b) these shoes are perfect for my super wide feet.i love that i can wear them to work or with jeans, and i can stand in them for 8 hours as well as walk around the city all day without a hint of discomfort. enormously recommended!
182946	these boots had much more of a stomper look than i expected. on the outside, the heel backs actually bow out a bit, but i found that the boots pressed on my heel on the inside. the material is good quality, and if you like the style and fit, they'd be a great winter/wet boot.
182973	it is true that these shoes run a half-size too small.  i wear a size 8 and ordered an 8.5 which fit nicely.  at first the shoe feels stiff, but the material quickly molds to your foot.  i have been wearing my pair at school and after work to walk my dogs.  the shoes do not smell at all. the reddish desert terrain has stained these shoes a faint reddish-brown.because of the thin sole, i would not recommend these for long day hikes or long road walking; they will wear down fast.  the white also dirties fast, but these shoes can be tossed into the washing machine and come out looking near-new.  (just don't place them in the dryer!)
183059	this wallet is totally great for it's price. the leather is very nice and in the red it is darker than in the picture which is nice from my point of view. i did not give it 5 stars because the pocket slits are a tad bit tighter than wallets should be to fit dl and cc and other cards. the fabric is a dead give away that the wallet was &#34;cheap&#34; but otherwise a great wallet if you don't mind stuffing the cards in a little harder. the fabric really isn't an issue and not obvious unless you are looking for something better made overall. zipper and closure works great.
183128	i wanted something like this for a while, but most of the ones i saw were brand names and i didn't want to spend a lot of money for something that might be a trend for this summer only. this look great, very fashionable, but don't expect great quality for that price...
183170	i love this boot. i want every color. most comfortable foot wear i have stepped into. my new go-to brand.
183197	i'm a shoe freak and have been looking a long time for some moccasin-style boots with a thicker sole.  i have super high arches and the thin soles with no shock absorption on most moccasins mean i can't wear them for any length of time.these are just awesome.  the faux fur is a super-cool look and the flannel on the inside means they're pretty warm (but not too warm, it won't regularly get below freezing for another couple of months here in the mid-south.)  i added one of those inexpensive gel inserts beneath the removable insole and now they're nearly as comfortable as another pair of boots that cost 3x as much.i was torn between these and the ankle-height model and i like them so much i'll probably buy both.  the size is pretty right on, i'm usually between an 8.5 and a 9 and the 9 fits with a little room, so i could i wear them with socks but don't have to.  the shaft also leaves a little room, so you could get some jeans down inside these if needed.minnetonka is also crazy well made so i know these will last for years.  buy with confidence!  honestly i think these are a superb deal for the money.  i'm getting lots of compliments on mine.
183215	this corset was perfect. it buckles in the front so the individual can put it on themself (never understand ones that do it in the back since someone else has to help which to me defeats the purpose of it) anyways, it is nice and form fitting (but yet forgiving if needed) and gives the bust a nice pushup. the skirt is a great added touch. the price was great!
183248	my only complaint is that i don't like 3 hooks.  i have arthritis in my fingers, and that makes it very hard to do 3.  i have to hook them in front and then turn the bra around.  comfortable.  supportive.  i can't wear underwire, but this works for me as i am not large.
183287	i broke both of my feet last june and was in 2 cast for 6 months.  now these are the only shoes i can ware so i buy clarks now they feel so good on my feet so the doctor told me these would be the only  ones i could ware from now on.  i love these and so for i have around 6 pairs of clarks.  i would not have another pair of shoes except for clarks
183332	these are pretty cool. but i found two things that bothered me by the time i was done wearing  them while grocery shopping. one being the straps sort of stretched out not long after wearing them around. and the whole shoe felt very sloppy. so i tightened them up. then had an issues with my pinky toe rubbing on the sole. which made it a bit uncomfortable after awhile. i normally wear a size 7 is why i bought that size in these. but could have went with a six and a half i think. the only reason i rated  this shoe the way i did was because i had at least two cons to this shoe. and don't see myself wearing these too often. which i don't like that. if i take the time to buy shoes i think i will like. and they fit perfect and can be worn often. that's what deserves a 5 star rating. not to sit in my closet for a rainy day or end up being giving away. but it is what it is. if i had a chunky foot, maybe these would have worked out better for, i don't know. i'm not gonna gain weight to find out lol. yes i would recommend this shoe. but with caution.
183334	got them for my mom, they are big but not heavy and look awesome. love the price but the shipping was a little to much, still worth it!
183384	love clarks shoe this one is very comfort.it easy to to put on and take off.i only wear clarks shoes.
183392	this pair of clarks shoes was painful on me.  not all clarks come in a wide width, but some of their medium widths fit me perfectly.  some of their wide widths are too wide.  sometimes the sizing is off, running too large.  this shoe seemed to fit size-wise, but if you have a wide foot or bunions, beware!  the leather front stops right at the area where one would have a bunion and it was painful!  the toe box was not roomy enough either.  i tried them on and couldn't walk to the other side of the room without pain, so i had to return them.  they were cute, though.  too bad.  i like clarks shoes, but they really need to improve their standards on accurate sizing and widths.
183399	these boots were too wide and large and loose--not unusual fit for clarks, but the poor fit made them impossible to wear. style-wise, pretty enough. if you have a narrow heel but don't wear a narrow shoe, i would not recommend these boots. if you have a normal to wide width foot, you'll love these.
183413	i read a few reviews about this product and seemed almost too good to be true... i love clarks, but not usually a fan of the styles they offer, so i thought i'd try this and see how it goes.this boot was really cute, stylish, and so comfortable!  lots of cushion inside, i need that for being on my feet all day.the leather of the entire shoe is really nice, great quality. so soft.  the only problem i had was that it was a half size too big.  i like to wear socks with my boots and even with thick socks, this was big.i normally wear an 8.5 and i always order a 9 in boots, had to send back for the 8.5.  they were so great, i'm considering getting another color.the brown is very true to the picture. i have seen pics on other sites and the brown is more orange, this is not the case.  i'm going back for the black, grey or maybe both!
183495	i am pleased with this ring. it is well made and not too thick and so is great for stacking. i expected the stainless steel to be too dark and the cz's by contrast or quality to be too bright. not so. i pair this with a platinum band and a white gold antique band and it sit snug between them not looking inferior in any way.
183496	i was looking for a very thin, dainty ring... and for the price of this ring, it is very pretty. it's just not what i expected at all from the pictures. it's much bigger (thicker) than it appears and it feels like it pushes my fingers apart! it's actually quite uncomfortable. i'm probably just gonna put this in a drawer somewhere and buy a plain band to wear instead.
183503	it's a beanie. not hard to get that right. no logo, no patterns, just a simple beanie. does what it is supposed to do, is really comfortable, and looks good.
183532	this is certainly no slouchy beanie. having read the reviews beforehand i expected the worst and hoped for the best. i received a regular hat (as so many others did) which was definitely not slouched and definitely not ribbed....much to my displeasure. despite this, it is still a pretty warm and snug fitting hat that fits and works great. i wear it all the time and though it is not what is advertised nor what i wanted, it still works. so eh, no biggie.
183553	these were so soft and fit exactly the way they should, but fabric was far too thin and delicate. pulling on the fabric just slightly while removing them tore a huge hole in the side. i checked to see if something punctured the fabric, but there was no indication of anything like that. not sure if it was a fluke or not.
183558	i expected better from minnetonka.  the slippers were at least a full size too small.  i returned them rather than risk getting another mislabeled product.
183567	how could i resist blue suede shoes! fun shoes. comfortable. box contained one shoe for the left foot and one for the right foot.
183610	i really liked this necklace, but ended up returning it. it is very heavy..seems to pull my neck down...just be aware!
183653	this ring set is ok for a travel ring if you don't want to lose something expensive. the large stone looks cheap. i do wear the bang on a seperate finger & looks good.. overall i wouldn't have bought it if i would've known. i guess that's what i get of buying jewerly online! haha!
183756	not a fair review because amazon sent me the wrong shirt, so i have to return it, but i do like the navy color.
183785	i bought this under my husbands name...i love it !!! it fits  perfect. i am 5 4 and  125 pounds i bought a small and it looks just like the picture. cant wait to buy different colors.
183806	these are some nice boots, but they ran a little too narrow for me. they fit but hardly any wiggle room. i like a some room to wear a thicker sock. i would have to wear thin socks, which is not good for a cold-natured person like me. have to order a wider width.
183822	i have made several orders from game gear and love the quality and fit of the products they make.i want more made in the usa. excellant pricing and quality!
183823	i bought large. i am 6'6&#34; and 235lbs and a weight lifter.  bought these for deadlifting and squating.  truly love them.  they are attention grabbers as well.
183842	i am delighted with these boots. the wide fit is great for my 20 inch calf and they are the most comfortable boots i own.  i just wish the shaft was an inch higher.  i like a tall boot.
183864	i was a bit unsure of buying this item at $6 a top. i was expecting a thin top, cheaply made. im happy to say the top is very high quality and made very nice. very true to size also.
183881	the only reason i gave a 4 vs 5 is because the toy doesn't hook onto other sets, like the train. the people interchange which is great. takes slot if abuse from a 2 year old, we had it several months before he or i noticed the wings move.
183888	looks good on, and the material its not heavy and it does not leave a mark on my face.. if you like big this is it
183906	i normally buy wanted brand shoes on amazon. but they were sold out in my size and after searching for days on amazon for a pair of black flats, i saw the glowing reviews of this pair and ended up purchasing them.honestly the fit is weird. i am a size 9 (medium width) and i ordered 9. the shoe is too wide and doesn't fit around the foot well. it opens up on the sides and looks like a bad fit even at first glance. i was thinking if i had ordered a size less than 9, would it have been better, but then again the area near the toes would have been too tight as already the toe area is snug. so trying to go a size down to make one part of the shoe fit is not going to do it as the rest of the shoe will not fit well at all.this shoe is heavy. i am used to wearing only flat shoes and this is the heaviest shoe i have ever had.the shoe sole is very hard as though the heel is resting on concrete and only the area towards the top half of the foot is flexible.i have shoes that feel like i am walking on clouds but this one is not even close. i cannot send it back as i paid for postage to get it and it will not be worth it to pay for postage to return. this will go to a charity and hope that someone else has better luck with them.
183911	great watch and i like that it is solar so no battery is needed!  if you are looking for a nice present this is one as i purchased this for myself.
183930	product looks good when jewelries are displayed.  i am able to put on 90 percent of my earrings.  the small round or hoop earrings would not fit however.  and, it does not feel durable.  i have to be very careful taking my earrings off and back on it.
183960	hold all my college books with room for a change of clothing and lunch-  great weekend bag too.wheels are holding up well used daily for over 6 months with at least 40lb of weight.  side pockets large.  handle very stable.
183961	the backpack is good..the handle sucks. the first day using the handle would pull all the way out and not lock into the intermediate position. in this case: for tall ppl its great. if your short or young (for your kids), its to low to the ground cause it wouldn't lock on the first click, slide right past it and go into the super long position.for the price, it should have worked properly in the first place. ugh.
184008	i picked orange, made well. fits perfectly. very comfortable and soft. you will love it. great fit. i wear it all the time.
184011	"i think these running shorts (especially in black) is a classic and may be a must-have for a man who wants to look effortlessly attractive while being active.  but, there's a caveat.if you already have bubble-muscular or big-size buttocks and thighs, you'll look great in these.  for guys who don't, you'll find the shorts a bit roomy and not being able to pull off the look.  though the shorts appear riske, they'll keep your ""package"" covered. believe me, i tried. ;)the price is reasonable.  the quality exceeds my expectation.  i machine washed it, and it still looks like new.  it is 83% polyester, 17% spandex, and for the sheer or see-through colors, it is 92% polyamide, 8% spandex.  thus, i'd recommend air or line dry it to preserve its shape.  machine dry wouldn't ruin these shorts, but may reduce durability."
184017	"i have three pairs of these shorts. all are medium and i am 6'1"" and 187lbs. yes they are short and split at the hip. no they don't have a liner...and that is why they are wonderful! men have genitals and buttocks. they just do! these shorts display it all while being an effective garment for exercise...anywhere at all. your stuff is covered. you are legal. if you are a prude, run in some blue jeans and don't diss a garment that celebrates the male form! these shorts are surprisingly durable. a quick swish in soapy water and let them air dry. or take a dip in the pool/lake after your workout and really show off!"
184035	this material is stretchy and sheer, so its a nice cover up for the summer as its very breathable and cute too!
184049	after i placed the order i saw that everyone said it ran small and it does.  order the next size up.
184077	love the belt.  it has a nice stretch and emphasizes the waist nicely.  love the design on the front of the belt.
184117	the wig that arrived wasn't the dusty rose color in the picture, but a little lighter.. more cotton candy like. anyway two people immediately knew who i was supposed to be after putting the wig on at the party where i received it. it needs a little trimming naturally, but all wigs do. it's sooooo soft. i mean like really, really soft. however this does lend to the fact that it can tangle easily. it brushed like a dream with a proper wig comb and a little wig conditioning spray, though your fingers could do the trick if you're gentle. totally recommend it, especially for the price. i've included a picture of the wig on my stand, though the flash can do funny things to color.[...]
184120	soft, easy to style the bangs, looks real, and quick shipping! i got it for my moka cosplay from rosario + vampire and it looks great.
184157	a zipper closure, and a few nice pockets, this is a classic, feminine laptop bag that fits my 13&#34; macbook air along with two ipads, or large books in the padded laptop pocket - larger computers would fit comfortably as well. i got this in brown and get so many compliments on it - folks can't believe it's *intended* to be a laptop bag - everyone thinks it's a purse! the polkadot lining is a bit much for me, but everyone else seems to like it, so i'm fine with it. a bit playful, but love it.
184238	i purchased these and a pair of the teva mush ii.  these are a bit shorter and wider than the mush ii, but not by so much that i had to get a different size.  i'd say an 1/8&#34; or so more wide and about a 1/4&#34; shorter.  for me that little extra bit of width makes them perfect!!  and that 1/4&#34; does not leave my foot hanging off the back.(however, that is not to say that the mush ii don't also fit perfectly...they do...i just like this fit a little better.)this footbed is nice and thick and comfy.  the emblem is on the back of the shoe, not in the heel cup...which is great for me since i don't like to feel tags under my feet.  (if you're considering the mush ii, the emblem is embedded in the heel &#34;cup&#34; and cannot be removed.)i love this kenny purple!  for some reason, the design reminds me of peacock feathers.  the color goes with almost everything!
184280	fit me around the hips but the crotch and string are so long i had to either pull them up to my belly button or have about an inch and a half of slack fabric hanging around... which i suppose i could have cut some of the g string length and sewn it back to make it snug. but i didn't see the point. other than that they were just okay.
184292	these clarks fit great, true to size and are well made.  the leather smell was a little strong right out of the box, but faded after wearing a few times.  i did not care for the stitching detail on the boots.  you can't really tell in the picture, but is is a tan thread and really contrasts with the black leather.  however, i used one of my craft waterproof pens and just colored over the stitching and now i have fabulous looking solid black boots!
184416	i love this fleece. highest of quality, runs a little small so if between sizes go up one. i normally wear a large, but bought xl, fits perfect. don't waste your money on anything else.
184422	"everyone needs a good fleece jacket and the columbia steens mountain 2.0 is a great all-around fleece. it's warm, comfy and inexpensive. i'm 5'9"" and 142 lbs. and bought a size small which is a fairly slim fit. if you want it roomier i'd get a medium. i typically wear this jacket over my lightweight dress shirts at work (indoors) where the temp is often in the low 70's. this jacket is perfect for that temperature. it's great outside too although it's not the type of fleece that provides any wind protection. i haven't put this jacket through any rigorous activities but it's held up great. it has two outside zip pockets and two very loose inside pockets. the sleeves have elastic cuffs and the waste has adjustable elastic."
184456	i love these orthaheel shoes. i love the non slip tread.  i would recommend these to anyone that walks alot at work.
184471	i love orthaheels, and i think they are cute as well as comfy and awesome at addressing my planters.  i was a little nervous ordering these as they didn't look so wonderful in the pictures.  but since i love all other orthaheel's i've purchased, i ordered.  they look like ugly rain boots to me and the height of the shaft hit at a very uncomfortable place.  they went  right back.  however...amazon and footsmart has been quite accomodating in my purchasing/returning experiences (even though footsmart's phone reps aren't very cheerful and don't really seem to enjoy customer service positions).
184655	the fit is perfect.  it is long mid thigh but i'm short, 5' 2&#34;.  it's warm with just a tee shirt to about 50 degrees then you need something else under it.  the jacket is fitted but not tight, a sweater fit under comfortably.  i really like this jacket.
184696	too snug.  what i want from a slipper is comfort.  although the fit was 'accurate', it felt like i was wearing a snug shoe.well made, beautiful to look at, high-end quality.  i returned them however due to it feeling like a shoe than a comfy slipper.
184709	i don't know what they made these slippers out of, but they are the exact opposite of soft and cuddly, and the price is exorbitant.
184739	i'm a knitter.  i could handknit socks like this for cheaper than $20, it's true.  however, i couldn't do it easily.  socks are the main type of project that gives me ceaseless headaches.  i'm happy to pay $20 for these high-quality, fun and sturdy socks.  my only beef  is that i bought the medium (i'm a size 8) hoping they'd still fit after laundering.  i got them today and laundered them immediately, and they are now almost - *almost* - too small.  they feel like compression socks now.  so in the future i'll be ordering the large so that they shrink comfortably to my foot instead of squeezing.  (for your reference, my laundry cycle includes a cold water 'casual' wash in dreft followed by an 80-minute hot tumble dry.  this is, i mean, for a full load of laundry!  i wouldn't launder just one pair of socks.)
184744	these socks are a great gift for the cotton-lover in your life! it is getting so hard to find cotton socks that are made in the usa -- these are! plus, these are fun socks that will make you or your giftee smile every time she wears them. they wear like iron, even when you machine wash and dry. i do think they run a teensy bit small -- if you are between sizes, order up.
184796	i have not have to use these yet, but anticipate to use them in the future. they are long enough for the average full boot.
184902	this is my third thule product.  having had the other two for over a year each i feel like i'm becoming very familiar with the craftsmanship and utility of their products.  what i love about thule overall is that they are very durable.  you can carry it everyday, throw it in overhead bins on an airplane or in the backseat of your car and the bag itself still looks great and your stuff stays intact.  i also really love the water-restistant material.  it's great if you should happen to have a water bottle leak or spill on the pack.  given that i often have electronics inside i like knowing they aren't going to get water damaged.  i have even had it out during a moderate rainstorm for about an hour and while i am sure the manufacturers wouldn't recommend that, the contents of my bag were still dry.  there are also a fair number of pockets, so it's easy to have the things you need right at hand.  i especially like the outside pocket for thin waterbottles.  the fact that it has two handles, in addition to a strap, is also great because it means there are more ways to grab it if you are trying to retrieve it, like from an overhead bin.that said, i think if i had to choose between this pack and thethule crossover tcmb-115 15.4-inch macbook/pro/air or pc messenger bag (black)i already own, i'd probably go with the latter for a few reasons.  one, while this sling pack does have a designated and well padded pocket for your laptop it's inside the bag (vs. the messenger bag that has it in it's own pocket on the outside).  the other bag allows you to unzip just that compartment so you don't have to take your laptop out when going through security.  this bag does not.  in theory i guess you could zip the bag open to lay the laptop flat but that would only work if you had nothing else in the main compartment of the backpack.  the sling pack also does not have a designated reinforced smart phone pocket.  yes, there are several pockets you could use for a phone, but they are not reinforced and don't fit the phone snugly.  for me this is a feature i really miss from the old bag because i use it constantly.  it's saved my phone from getting damaged when my bag got jostled and keeps it right at hand.it also largely personal, but as a petite woman i find this pack a little bit harder to carry.  despite the wide strap, it doesn't sit on my shoulder as well as the other bag does.  and the sling design is bad, say if i need to bend down and tie my shoe because i find that unless i strap it very tightly the bag tends to wiggle around quite easily and throws off my balance.overall, i think it's a very well made, durable and functional bag.  i don't think it has quite the utility ofthule crossover tcmb-115 15.4-inch macbook/pro/air or pc messenger bag (black), but if you prefer a sling to a messenger or don't intend to use this for air travel (or don't care that you have to remove your computer) this bag is a great choice.  i intend to use it as my second bag more when i am going to and from work than traveling.
184916	i wanted a bag in-between a backpack and a small rolling suitcase and this is perfect!! i use it all the time. the zipper seems to be good quality and hasn't snagged anything. the shoe compartment is neat but its hard to put shoes back in when the bag is full. the patterned liner inside is a cute touch every time i open it. when traveling on short jet plane rides i usually still have the put my small rolling suitcase below, but this bag you can stuff anywhere. great bag!
185037	i have been searching for women's shorts that are long enough so they don't ride up when i sit down.  these are very close to what i was looking for.  they could be about an inch or two longer but they are substantially longer than the under armor pair i just bought.  these shorts are cool and comfortable.  i will probably purchase more colors in this style because the trend for women's active wear shorts is very short and that does not work for me.
185081	i love these pantyhose! now i don't really expect them to be extremely long lasting...i'm always rough on pantyhose, always have been, and i'm usually lucky to get two wearings from any pair. i like these a lot. open toe shoes are of course, a staple of summer, and i loathe the idea of wearing regular hosiery with open toe shoes, it's tacky. it's also unprofessional or inappropriate at times not to wear pantyhose. this solves the problem so i don't have to choose between a cute pair of shoes and propriety, and frankly i find that most dress shoes are more comfortable with hosiery.
185082	i love these toeless pantyhose!  the only problem is that they tear very easy.  i tore them while trying to pull them up because they are so controlled.  otherwise, it is a great product!
185142	i got this checkbook cover to match a purse i had gotten. the colors match close enough so i purchased the product. i liked it when it arrived and it arrived on time. i put my checks and my stubs in it and went to close the tab and on the end of the tab the leatherette did not cover all of the end and therefore it had cardboard sticking out of the end.i did not want to go to the hassle of returning it so i just kept it. also, there was a tag left in the cover that the retail price was $12 and i paid $17 something for it plus shipping and handling so i was not to happy about that. they could have taken the tags out of the cover and i would not have felt so bad about it.  but i guess you learn as you go.
185160	i'm so glad i purchased these boots. they are amazing!! i haven't even worn them yet but straight out of the box i got complements on them. i've worn them around the house and they are true to size and very comfy. i wanted tan boots but i ordered taupe instead and i'm really happy i did, great color. these are the best!
185167	i get more compliments on these boots than any of the (too) many other pairs i own. they required no time to break in at all and are easy to walk in all day. fit well, glad i bought them even though i definitely did not need yet another pair of boots.
185216	i bought a pair of ryka exertion two years ago and was extremely happy with them. i wear them exclusively for jazzercise. this is therefore my second pair. i have worn them several times already and they fit just like the first pair, just perfect! the color is beautiful!
185221	i am a zumba instructor who is hard on her feet teaching 2-4 classes a week so they last about 14 months before they become to warn on the bottom. love them.
185456	these are worth paying a little more for.  they are very soft, comfortable and stay in place.  the bands are enclosed which is also nice.  highly recommend.
185478	it's everything i was hoping for when i placed the order. it's higher quality than i feared for the price, and a good weight. it's light enough to flow around you, but cozy enough to keep you warm. i keep mine at the office for when i need a little extra warmth but don't want to sit with my coat on. there are some loose threads and such, but i clipped them off and now it's perfect.
185483	this is a stylish clog and very comfortable - much cuter than dankso's.  however in ordering my true size, i found them to be a bit small. they would have fit comfortably without socks, but that isn't how i intended to wear them.  thankfully, amazon makes it easy to exchange sizes and i returned them for a half size larger.  with a better fit now, i wear them frequently and find them ideal for days i'm on my feet a lot.
185485	i like everything about ariat amy clog.  it is comfortable, very good quality leather and soles (as compared with other brands), and very cute too (with a bit of western style!).  this shoe also add some height for my petitie size.  however, as another reviewer mentioned, you need to be careful when turning a corner in a fast pace because of the height of the shoes, and also because there is a tiny gap between the rubber soles and the platform (see the photo for the sole of the shoe).  nevertherless, i like it so much, i already ordered another one in black.  i wear size us7 in most brands and for ariat as well, but as i have a narrow feet, i have to wear thick socks.
185521	originally i wanted a bathrobe, which plush doesn't serve as a material for whatsoever, and this robe is no exception - but its still great. its pretty, doesn't fuzz up in the washer or dryer, its comfortable and warm, overall a good buy. my favorite robe.
185524	i love this bathrobe. it is made of the softest terry cloth i've ever felt--like wearing clouds. it has a ribbon tie at chest level as well as the belt, so it's much easier to wear it in a modest way. the sleeves are wrist length on me which is perfect. i have fairly short arms, so they might be shorter on you. the length is good--knee length as shown. i definitely recommend this one!
185547	as a very petite woman (5'2&#34;, 95 pounds), i'm always a bit afraid that &#34;one size&#34; clothing will be too big for me. although it is a little loose, all i had to do was take the waist in one inch and now it is just perfect. i was so excited when i tried it on for the first time with one of my lolita dresses. it's light and fluffy, and it looks exactly as it appeared in the picture. it also came in a few days earlier than schedule. i am a very satisfied customer!
185588	great jacket that looks good and keeps you warm without making you too hot. love all the pockets that are provided inside the jacket.
185611	i always love the color white and this watch did not fail me.  i use it daily to match my white eyeglasses.  my friend who saw it love it as well.  thanks.
185667	we both love it better than expected its got beautiful colors and looks good quality we totally recommended great price
185694	with one exception, i've used casio wristwatches exclusively for the last 30+ years, and i've reviewed the last couple of them and given them five stars. my current casio, a w-93h has been with me for 7-8 years, and it's still running on the original battery. in other words, i love casio watches. no, they're not fine jewelry, but they're smart-looking, inexpensive, and deadly accurate timepieces.the aq-s810w-1av is one of casio's more recent products, and i had high expectations, especially with the solar power that meant never having to replace the battery again. setting up the watch was a bit more complicated than for other casios that i've owned, but i got everything right on the second try. also, after setting the digital time, the analog hands automatically synced (there is no seconds hand, but the seconds display in the digital window). once the watch is set up properly, the built-in calendar is good till the year 2099, so you'll only need to change any settings if you move to another time zone. i use a watch primarily for timekeeping, but the aq-s810w-1av's alarm, countdown timers, and stopwatch functions are very capable. the dual timers can be set with two different countdown times, a nice feature. my only problem with the alarm and timer features is that the alarm sound isn't very loud - with any background noise, it would be easy to miss hearing it. the stopwatch will clock split times, with times being recorded to a hundredth of a second.about the solar cell and rechargeable battery: the manual indicates that as little as eight minutes of direct sunlight a day will keep the battery charged. even indoor fluorescent lighting will keep the battery charged, but it takes up to eight hours. for most people, keeping the battery charged shouldn't be a problem.the back of the watch shows that it's water resistant to 10 bars. that's approximately 10 atmospheres, or 330 feet in ocean water. scuba divers seldom go that deep, but i've taken every casio i've owned to at least 100 feet, with no more maintenance than a freshwater rinse after diving.overall, this is a fine watch, and i have no problem retiring my older casio watch for this one.
185718	this watch is nothing like most of the gshocks out there that are big and bulky. this watch has a smart design and it looks good with anything you wear. it's one of those watches that you hope casio stops making because you don't want to see a lot of people wearing it! the watch is thin and very light. the black coated metal is very handsome and the white hands stand out which makes the watch look very cool. i've owned 20+ gshocks in the past and this one is my most favorite. this was is very easy to set-up unlike the gw3000 and other analogue gshocks. some people may not like that the light is positioned at the 6 o'clock and it doesn't have an afterglow. it has a yellowish light and you can see the time. the white hands lights up as long as it's got sun or light exposure. the watch is multiband 6 so you do not have to set the time. it's also solar power which means you don't have to change batteries.
185719	"i had a lot of high hopes for this watch. when it arrived, i was quite displeased. i disregarded other reviewers mentioning the digital display being, ""too small."" i assumed those reviewers had poor vision, but i was wrong. the digital display on this watch truly is tiny and is literally impossible to see in the dark, which leads to my next complaint. the light on this watch is practically worthless. it somewhat illuminates the analog display, but does not illuminate the rest of the watch.it is a nice looking watch, and i suppose it is worth it if you don't need the digital display or illumination. i, however, need these functions, which is why i returned this watch for a different g shock model here on amazon. i would not recommend this particular watch.***update***i received the watch i returned this one for and am even happier now that i did. this watch cannot hold a candle for the one that replaced it."
185757	love having a light weight jacket with sun protection built in!!!  i have been wearing a similar jacket, almost year round, for 2 yrs. now!
185767	"however, it's functional for my intended casual use in the rain and is mostly the cut, style, and lightness i was looking for in a raincoat.  and i guess the price was inexpensive (compared to what i usually spend on coats anyway) so you kinda get what you pay for.  i actually think this coat shouldn't run more than $30ish.i have a somewhat-nicer-than-casual travelsmith raincoat that looks nice enough to wear year-round in this similar cut and style but can't find it through them anymore... this is the closest style i could find... but it definitely looks cheap compared to my travelsmith coat.  dang. i really feel like i bought the walmart copy of my travelsmith, lol.not so in the picture.  they look almost the same if you just compared pics.  plus this one is crinkly and sounds crinkly and feels more like a windbreaker with a heavy lining.  trust me, the picture makes this jacket look a lot nicer than it actually is.  even the colors look more faded in person (i looked at two).  but then i paid a lot more for my travelsmith coat so i really shouldn't compare... but i can't help it!!  if you aren't expecting high quality, you won't be disappointed.  it's an okay casual jacket with a nice style and cut.i have the khaki color and there is a black lining underneath... the khaki part is so thin and windbreakerish that there is a dark tint to it from the lining.  it looks fine on this color, but i read complaints on ordering the white so be careful if they still have a dark lining on that one.  the hood is very generous and a great size for a downpour, but not crazy disproportionate to the whole coat or anything.  i have yet to wear it in actual rain so i don't know just how waterproof it will actually be.and a size warning...  it looks like the style is meant to run big.  but it is really big, lol... ignore the amazon sizing chart!! it's incorrect for this jacket.  instead look at the woman within sizing chart which is right on this page under ""product description.""  you will see how different they are.  this is probably a great coat for taller women.  i am 5'3"" so this looks big and baggy on me so it helped to go down in size.i had read reviews on woman within which warned of sizing issues and ordered a size down (plenty of reviews there if you'd like more opinions, but i've addressed many of the patterns i saw there).  and ordering one size down could have been acceptable, i guess, but i prefer a trimmer look and didn't like the vague feeling i had on a big, shapeless garbage bag, so i returned it and ordered a second size down and it was much more form-fitting... perfect because i am in warmer weather and will not be wearing bulky sweaters under it, just t-shirts. and the sleeves now fit perfect. if you want to wear sweaters under it, i suggest you just go one size down."
185773	i read the sizing guide and bought what fit my measurements, not my usual size. apparently the brand runs large but by using the sizing guide, i got a jacket that fits perfectly. it seems very well made and warm. it hasn't been cold enough yet to wear, but i am very glad i got it.
185796	this is an awesome tunic but the sizes run really big.buy a size or two smaller and will be perfect
185798	i am not a plus size, but like longer tunics to wear with leggings or jeggings. once i sorted out the size issue (order small, wash/dry to shrink it some) i had a couple of successful purchases.  and i would have so liked this top, but the front rounded hemline was cut off center.  it was someplace over my right leg instead of being centered.  no more for me.
185860	lovely bras! size corresponds! excellent quality! lovely color! very comfortable when wearing it very. worth a specified price. i am very happy!
185905	these are not the squared toe. my little ballerina loves the slippers. i ordered a half size bigger and they fit perfectly.
185917	looks exactly like the images on the site. fits great, i am a 32 waits and bought a 34 belt and it works perfectly. leather is not as tough as the brown version, i bought both, and i definitely feel like the brown belt is sturdier.
185932	the suitcase seemed nice, very shiny.  it reminded me of a pink r2 d2 from star wars.  i think it would have been ok, but i found a multi- colored set of hard case  luggage that i liked better. i gave this a 3-star rating  because i did not get a chance to test how the luggage holds up to airline handling. .
185979	"unwearable due to the huge, cardboard-like molded cups that pulled away from my body! just an ill-fitting disaster! they are not ""supportive full coverage cups with side sling"" as the description states. the cups are ridiculously large and bulky, even for the size, which was 40dd.the racerback lace is so lightweight compared to the copiously thick cups that it immediately makes the band ride up, for further discomfort. looks nothing like the photos!!"
186006	hat arrived in great condition and as the estimated delivery date. i burn very easily and i ordered this hat to shield me from the sun. i am going to girls camp in june and i will get good use of this.i do crafts and i am going to add ribbon and flowers. i am very pleased with this hat. i would use this vendor again.
186082	i really like these boots. i feel like i might have ordered a size bigger so i do recommend getting half a size smaller when buying these boots
186103	i bought this top for my severely non-sartorial wife, and she looks fantastic in it!  it is definitely shows off her assets in a very pleasing manner, and i cannot help but stare at her all day long.  she says the fit is fine, and it went through one laundering cycle with no shrinkage at all.  to top off what is a fantastic product, i also received an unexpected email follow up from the company, so this was just an all around great experience.
186112	i just received this top in black/red. it's super nice. the material is thin but, i love the style, it's sexy.i can't wait to wear it out & about &#60;3
186122	this is a sexy top! it fits great. im thinking about getting it in other colors too. even my son compliments tjis shirt.
186125	i just adore and love this top. this is not my first purchase from this store and i will continue being a return customer. this top is so cute. it gives you a faux tank and shrug appearance which is totally hot without being trashy. it looks great with jeans as well as shorts and skirt. i'm glad i ran across this seller on amazon.
186130	i love this shirt. it looks so great. it fits extremely well and the look is great. i can wear it to work on casual friday or even going out. this is my new favorite shirt.
186132	the top loop part sits just right.doesn't sag. its thin so its great for layering or early fall.sleeves sre nice and long!
186134	i really like the concept of the shirt however, i thought the material would be a little different. it clings to every flaw on my body. beware if you have big you know whats because it makes the key hole larger. the top of my bra shows. i like the long length of the sleeves but i will not be wearing the top until i lose some of the love handles. this top does fit true to size.
186202	i was looking for something with no seams that i could wear under skirts in the summer or under lighter weight summer pants and not have panty lines. i was not looking for a shaper however this does have light shaping.  this is perfect and is just the right length and no seams, therefore no lines or show through. just right!
186382	upon arrival i removed them out of their plastic bag. the hand of the fabric was lucious. this is not the cheap fluffy kids flannel. this is an authentic egyptian flannel. i highly recommend washing them first to take the stay out of the new fabric, this makes them much softer and comfortable to wear.  i wear a large and ordered an xl according due to other reviews. the leg length is long, which i found awesome. i also agree with another review that you could tack down the lapel of the top so it doesn't wrinkle up and it looks better. these are high quality light to mid weight flannel that is perfect for sleeping. very perfect for lounging and sleeping. i live at 6500 ft snow level and in the single digits it is so nice. i am 5'8&#34; and it is very difficult to find proper leg length and sleeve length. i only bought two pair but i will be buying more due to the superb sewing used on these pj's...
186410	"***update***  the large fits great and is very flattering.  a little ""off the shoulder"" or ""wide-ish"" in the neck/shoulder area, but cute.this top is cute, but i should have followed the sizing chart.  i read the reviews and ordered up a size because i thought it ran small.  i am 5'4, 140 and busty.  i ordered an xl and it was too big, i mean really, really big, long and baggy.  i am returning it for a l which is what their sizing chart recommends based on my bust size.  i am looking forward to receiving the smaller version!"
186433	i wore this today for the first time taking my toddler and four month old to the zoo. it was so comfortable on this 61 degree cloudy day. for whatever reason this top came up in my amazon search when i typed in nursing tops for breastfeeding moms. it actually worked out very well for this purpose but the top is so flattering i will definitely wear it beyond my nursing days. the one negative is i don't see any tag that indicates how to wash it. i guess i'm going to try gently cycle tumble dry low. the material is thick unlike so many cheap cotton sweaters these days and i have to say the seller did a beautiful job packing it. the sweater arrived folded, wrapped in tissue paper that was sealed with a gold sticker and shipped in a flat white cardboard box. the price is a little high but it really is a nice quality.01/15/14: i've washed this sweater twice now in the gentle cycle and tumble dry/ no heat and it's pilling pretty severely. i just bought this and it already has an old sweater look to it. for what i paid i expect more. if this sweater requires special cleaning such as dry clean, then the least they can do is provide it with a tag that has care instructions. i had to take a guess and i thought i was erring on the side of caution. not pleased. my 4 stars just turned into 2.
186494	i got the blue and grey coloring and it is beautiful! the blue is actually more rich than in the picture and looks great with the light grey color. i was wondering when i bought it if it was in fact a single shirt or a top hoodie with an attached inner grey shirt. this may have been a dumb question, but in case anyone is wondering about it too, it is in fact a single shirt; the grey parts are simply sown on to look like a separate shirt. it is very cute though and looks great. the one warning i might give people is that it is a little thinner than i expected (definitely not the thickness of an actual hoodie), so it will not be very warm, but it's sold as a top so i probably should have assumed that. the material is very soft and it's pretty form fitting; it's a very flattering shirt. for those with larger busts who wonder if it might reveal too much, don't worry. i have a fairly large bust, and even in the small it doesn't show any cleavage. overall, it's a great and unique looking everyday shirt that goes great with jeans. i highly recommend it.
186503	havent used but i inspected the kit and i am very impressed with the product quality and expect to very satisfied with the item.mr. thomas a.
186509	i worried a lot before i bought the blackberry color. lot of money to pay for a pair of purple shoes. i love them. the fit, of course, is perfect for me - i have worn birks before. the color is my new black. i wear them with everything. fun to see my feet dressed in purple - makes me smile.
186556	much needed attire to ready my 8 yr old grand son for the &#8220;zombie apocalypse&#8221;.  he is a  black ops 2 fan but the zombies with the &#8220;blue eyes&#8221; kinda scares him.i told him that he can&#8217;t be afraid to fight zombies, the vest will help protect him from them and he can carry a lot needed zombie tools in it.
186584	lots of problems with these shoes:1. weird color of purple2. runs very large (like a whole size)3. shaped strangely in the toe area that makes them look like clown shoes4. feels like the strap is pulling on your heel with every stepone good thing: the soles and foot bed are really comfortable for my high arches. i guess i'll have to find a different style...
186585	i have recently been trying the orthaheel shoes and saw these at $49 and just had to try them.  all the dr. weil label of the orthaheel shoes are usually priced over $100.  since i am a 9 1/2 medium (on the narrow side)  i was unsure what size to order but decided with free shipping i would try the 9 first.  it fits perfectly. the color is a little darker shade that what shoes online.  this shoe was available online at qvc and you can watch a video there to see the color and their price is $!39!  the bottom is a milk chocolate color which coordinates perfectly with the plum.  the cork footbed is extremely comforatable.  i especially like that the ankle strap is adjustable.  like all orthaheel it has a wider than normal toe box which is fashionable.  there are natural striations in the leather that gives it some character.  you are supposed to clean these with a suede leather cleaner.  i am extremely pleased with the price and the product.
186749	i also bought these for my niece.  i can remember how many of these i had moons ago when my son was born onesie are always needed!
186882	the product is good, not too thin not too thick. i used it under baby's shortsleeves t's and onesies.  for my baby, it worked until he was about 10lbs, then it would fit very tight and it became difficult to put it on.
186921	i love these sweat pants. like the rock revival jeans - johanna t25 straight leg fleur flap pocket jeans in medium wash., these sweats fit perfectly around my legs. and not only are they comfortable, but they work great for a number of things, such as working out or if i just wear them around the house. i don't think i have been more pleased with a pair of sweats in my life. i highly recommend trying them on.
186932	i do like this shirt.  however, i am exactly a medium and this 'just' fits. the sleeves are a bit short as well.  it did not shrink though, and since i always have my sleeves pulled up, it works for me.  also, it's not quite as thick of a fabric as i was longing for.  hope this helps in the endless search for practical, well fitting, everyday women's clothing...
186942	i got the cd-2800 with the cleaning cloth and gem cleaner combo. the cleaner has a plastic basket inside to hold small items. set-up and use is amazingly easy. before first use, i rinsed the inside (which is made of stainless steel) and the basket.cleaning your items is as simple as adding tap water, putting your item in and pressing the on button. after that, the cleaner just buzzes for about 3 minutes, then it's done.i experimented with this quite a bit and i found the best combination is warm water with a few drops of regular washing detergent. i had varying success with eye glasses. grime that was pretty recent was easy to dislodge but grime that was years old from old glasses was difficult to get rid of. this is understandable because the cleaning is done by microscopic air bubbles and that kind of grime needs a metal scraper to scrape off. however, by far we got the best results with gold jewelry. gold that was dull became bright and shiny. that was a resounding success and the gold items seemed brand new.this cleaner can basically be used for any small objects such as jewelry, watch bands, coins, even dentures, toothbrushes and shaver heads.i think this is a very useful household item and it's at a very decent price. sample was received for review purposes but it doesn't change my opinion of it.
186959	"the chest is big enough for someone 3 sizes larger and the waist is too small to go over my hips. it would have at least been wearable if the hip cut was wider (though not flattering at all).  the material and condition are what i expected.  shipping took 5 days. attempting to return product--i was looking for something to wear on long runs and this isn't it.(i'm 5'10"" 150 lbs)**i've attempted to contact the seller and they will not respond**+seller responded with approval for return+~~this shirt is really good if your chest measurements are twice what your hips are~~"
186980	i was really excited to receive this shoe/boot.  they are super stylish and i love the tassels on the ties.  however, they turned out to be less than i had hoped.  first, they were quite narrow and difficult to get on.  second, they are wobbly and i felt unsteady in them.  this is probably due to the heel that is narrower than it looks in the photo and the platform at the ball of your foot.  in either case, feeling unsteady in my shoes will not do for a winter boot, especially since i live in an area were the sidewalks often have patches of snow and/or ice on them.  lastly, they are very high, and not very comfortable.  i am returning them.  :(
187104	these are perfect; they are warm and soft and they fit properly.  couldn't ask for a better pair.  they don't come off when you turn your head; you actually forget you're wearing them.  i can wear them with ear buds, too.  i wear sunglasses, too, but that's a bit more uncomfortable.i would highly recommend these.  i paid a tad more but they are worth it.
187129	love the price, love the feel of these boots and the wider top opening is great for people like me who have a hard time finding boots that are not too tight at the top.
187180	nice box to hold my watches. the box is not that easy to open and i need to use two hands to open. top of box is plastic not glass.
187289	but did not fit well at all. i ordered according to the size chart, but the bust was (way) too big and seemed to be cut much lower than in the pic. waist and hips were a good fit, but the top would have required some serious tailoring if i wanted to wear the dress. this one went back.
187306	i'm 5'9 about 150 lbs, and this dress fit well except it was for someone much shorter torso. it has a small train on the back.  the cut is otherwise very forgiving.
187318	this dress is gorgeous! i used the sizing provided and it fit all the way up to the chest. i guess i am just too busty but i followed the measurement chart exactly! so sad to return it
187321	although it was long enough, it was not flattering on my daughter who is 5' 10&#34; and smaller chested.  she said it showed every &#34;flaw&#34;.  returned and ended up buying the max and cleo esther knit dress http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b007goq32c/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=utf8&psc=1 which was so pretty!  i will include a picture on that review.
187322	this dress runs big and the lenght is long.  otherwise its a beautiful dress i would recomend to anyone just make sure to check the size they show before ordering.
187325	i first ordered this dress in a 4 - i'm 5'4&#34; and 125lbs and it would not zip up.  i reordered in a 6 and it fit perfectly.i did try the machite blue color first... it wasn't as blue as the picture and although the color was great i decided that it was going to match the bridal party too much (it's for a wedding) and reordered the green.  the green is darker than the picture, but no complaints on that.
187374	unless you have narrow feet, i don't see how these would be comfortable.  the buckle does not actually adjust the size of the shoe.  i don't wear a wide width, but my foot was jammed in there.  was a shame, because they were cute otherwise.  back they went...
187418	pros:these laces do the job, they tight the shoe and stay in place. seem to be durable. the colors are nice and vibrant. easy to use.cons:once you cut them to fit your shoe you can't take them off. if you take them off, the tip will fray and you won't be able to lace them through the eyelets again. it's a one-time, one-use shoelace.
187542	it was what i looking for and more, excellent quality, thanks a lot, i am very grateful, i love it
187543	these shoes were designed for foot torture. generally, i am the woman who wears stilettos to check the mail, eat a hotdog, or run a marathon. my feet are designed for impossible footwear. however, i wore these shoes to a basketball game, and i knew i was in trouble when my feet began to throb and go numb just by wearing them while sitting in the car. by the time i'd walked through the parking lot to the arena, my feet were bloody stumps.seriously, only after about an hour, blisters were forming on the balls of my feet and every single toe. walking in these cheap foot-manglers became literally impossible. i ended up chucking them off, and walking through a filthy downtown city in my stocking feet like an idiot.at $25, it's still no deal to have only been able to wear these shoes once. in fact, it's the exact same thing as paying someone $25 to smash your toes with a hammer.for foot torture enthusiasts: they do run true to size, and arrive quickly.sane people: don't buy!
187549	boots look great on the recipient.  end just below the knee so walking is not impeded.  they are a bit more fashion than function, so i wouldn't recommend wearing in rain or snow.
187553	shoes are cute on, but inside is cheaply made even for the price. calf size is perfect with tights although maybe a bit snug for skinny jeans (haven't tried yet). overall happy because i wanted a red pair of boots that were under $75.
187601	very cute top but almost difficult to wear because it comes in two pieces and i almost needed instructions to figure out how it went plus the first night i wore it out one of the chains broke in back and i had to use a pliers to fix it.
187653	this hat is wonderful.  it blocks your face from sun from any direction, but is just firm enough to adjust to where you can see.  the brim is like 4-5 inches, so it doesn't cast a shadow over your shoulders like some wide brim hats.  perfect for the pool as it doesn't easily get wet when walking around in the water.very nice hat.  florida friendly.
187699	the first time this was stretched out to fit my sons head (average size man), i could feel the sharp plastic edge of the band under the cheap lining.  these didn't stay on his head and were not nearly big enough to cover his ears all the way.  they look nice and that's about the only thing i can say about them, but they're cheaply made.
187749	they are so cute and comfortable.  it is as if i have nothing on my feet.  i would not wear them for long walks because they are a little too flexible for that and i have had a total knee replacement and try to wear more supportive footwear for that.  i will try an orthotic and see if that works.  but, i love minnetonka. i had a pair of the waterproof boots before and loved them.
187815	these panties are awesome. they fit perfectly, and they hardly have a pantyline showing. also, i started my period in them, and the blood even washed out, leaving no evidence. perfect!
187823	i ordered a size medium for my 8 year old, but she is also very thin and tall. it fits great, some of the edges are rough and cause a slight irritation on the skin so an undershirt may be required, but overall the costume is very cute. it is not too short and the arm and leg covers help because we live in snow country and trying to keep my daughter warm while she is trick or treating can be difficult but this costume makes it easy to add for temperature changes. it is durable, and will turn into dress up clothes after halloween.update:this costume does not come with the wig, but i chose not to get it. i ended up purchasing a snow princess crown instead because every experience i have ever had with a full wig was disastrous and it just added on a cost to a halloween costume that seemed unnecessary.
187836	very sturdy and cinchy. i wouldn't recommend wearing it while driving because sitting that way caused one of the steel bones to poke into my hip and leave a bruise, but other wise it isn't too bad. it is a corset, after all. it's not really supposed to be comfortable for all activities. looks great, too, and costs less that other &#34;professional&#34; sources. if i was going to purchase another corset in the future, i would buy something from this company, on amazon.
187839	i believe that these may run a little larger than i expected. this corset is well constructed and i would certainly purchase again.
187852	nice ring, sets low on ringer, looks like a real diamond, you will not be disappointed in this ring, however i will order stainless steel from now on...
187871	this skirt is made from a surprisingly durable thin material. it feels flimsy but wears well. hugs you in the right places and can be dressed up or down. it's really cute and simple and goes with pretty much everything in your wardrobe!
188018	i got the xl and they almost don't fit my size 12 hips. they are super tight and i wouldn't expect to wear them in front of anyone other than a significant other (unless you are comfortable wearing just your underwear around people, as that is pretty much how tight these were).
188090	i'm 5'4 and these boots sat right over my knee.  before purchasing, i read some reviews that the boots sometimes would fall down and scrunch at the boot.  i wasn't worried about that considering that my calves are bigger than most at a size of 16 inches circumference!!!  these boots are 16.5 so they fit perfectly!true to size so i would not order a .5 size smaller.  the boots also look better on than they do in the box so do not get a little discouraged when you 1st open the box!! put them on and you will see how great these boots are!! you can wear them with leggings and dress it up for a night out or you can wear them over skinny jeans and go with the casual trendy look (an oversized tunic top would complete the look with a cute scarf and earrings that pop).you get the best of both worlds.  you get the over the knee trendy boot look while having a heel that's not too high which can sometimes make a boot that falls over the knee look like hooker boots (which these do not!).i definitely recommend!!!!!  super fast shipping and they include 2 heel tips for when the original ones wear!!!!
188300	"leveret ""tiger"" 2 piece pajamas, which are 100% cotton, are wonderful for that tiger loving toddler.  they are soft, light weight - perfect for south texas winters - and the seams are smooth and well finished.  the tiger applique is more detailed than can be shown on the web and is quite realistic.  the bottoms are tiger striped; the yellow-orange is very vivid.a note for those whose toddlers are larger or for those whose toddlers dislike snug-fitting garments.  the leveret ""tiger"" pj's are snug and larger toddlers may find them uncomfortable, even when the appropriate size is purchased.  because these pj's fit so snugly, i do not think ordering a size up would provide enough extra room for those who prefer a looser fitting garment."
188363	me gusto el estilo, lastima que eran demasiados grandes y no iban con mi corte de cara, tienes que verlos bien antes de comprarlos, son muy lindos y el precio lo valen.
188380	i got this in earlier than estimated, which is awesome. it's exactly what it looks like in the picture. i always worry when things are so cheap, but this is precisely what i wanted.
188462	the sizing is true to size and the product looks great!  the sheer back is extremely sexy and and the entire panty is flattering.
188511	will never pay full price for beads again. great quality. looks like the real deal. will be getting more for gifts.
188525	the assortment received was delightful! great for sharing and great quality product. i love the little details on each bead. well worth the $$
188565	gorgeous gown. it seems i only love these cotton nightgowns any more. this one is extra special. very full. didn't shrink. i like it so much i wear it now (february) with an undershirt and a sweater over the top! i ordered one for my sister-in-law and she loves it. i am about to order one for a friend with cancer who spends her time in bed. this is really one of the most beautiful. i wish they could make a model with sleeves!
188643	i purchased this belt almost a year ago and have worn it many times. though it is not leather, i find it to be quality made. you really can't tell the difference when wearing the belt. people don't come up to you checking to see if your belt is made of real leather. after many wears, it is still in the same condition as the day i purchased it. i highly recommend to all of the obi belt loving people and for all vegans out there...
188681	"i take a size 10 but ordered a size 12 because of the comments here about the sizing.  however, the shoes were still too small - their ""12"" is actually about a 9.  so, back they go.  too bad, i really wanted to find some cheap sneakers that i wouldn't mind getting trashed while painting, yard work, etc."
188714	this new balance is trash. they haven't been able to get a country walker right since the 748. the upper feels flimsy and cheap. the sock liner is absolutely awful. i would expect this from a big-box store no-name shoe, but new balance...really! this shoe, in my opinion, isn't worth the price they are asking. some of their running shoes i've tried also suffer from the same quality issues. i suggest oboz or merrell until new balance ups their game.
188726	ok first i would like to make clear this is the best, most comfy bra i have ever owned and now i doubt i will ever go back to a back close bra. ( i had never tried a front close till this one and now i am hooked) not only because of being front close it's a great bra in general, but that is buy far why i love it so much!!that being said i am a busty women, i normally wear a 40dd that is what i first ordered in this after trying it on few times i decided to order a 42dd and the fit was much better as the smaller size fit but i had that dreaded roll over yuk!! i hate that, so with the larger size i didn't have that and is very comfy.good support no pain from fabric or wires,** now here's my issue....***- after only a few wearings ( under a week) the seams came out in 3 different places on that back of the bra, i really don't think i did anything to cause this i try to be carefull with my bra's to make them last as long as possible and i own a lot of bra's so was not just wearing this one even thou you could easly wear this under about anything.- keep in mind there is no adjustable back so order to your correct band size-it also has a very light piece of like plastic sewn inside the top of the cup to help it from sliding i normally do not like this as makes me sweat but i couldn't even tell it was there, and i am very picky, so those of you who like this feature it's there and if your like me and would snub up your nose at it in a store give it a chance it has not bothered the picky's of women (me!!)-i will also say there are no wires that poke you or ichy fabric or weird darts as some of glamorise bra's have, far as i can tell i wore this under a very light weight t-shirt and saw no weird darts or seams and the lace that's in it is soft not the stiff ichy kind. the straps are a little wider at the top for good support but not like crazy wide.
188731	i found this bra to be true to size and fit great.  it's hard to find a good fit and i was very pleased with this bra.
188763	beautiful and comfortable.  best front closure bra i've found for my size (42dd)!  i ordered another too.  the flimsy seeming front clip worried me at first  but seems to be holding up okay so far. (once you get the hang of how to clasp it)plum is pretty but please glamorize  come out with some other  colors!
188803	i have this bra in the 38 f/g.  normally, i get something that minimizes both the size and the movement of my breasts, since i do a lot of higher-impact activity (and even on the elliptical or stair climber, we larger-chested girls know that a high-impact bra is necessary to avoid a whole lot of jiggling and discomfort).but since i've been doing quite a lot of yoga lately, i wanted something that would be a bit more unrestricted, since a) yoga isn't just low-impact, it's no-impact, so immobilizing your breasts isn't necessary and b) feeling that restrained when trying to loosen your muscles and flow in a vinyasa class isn't very helpful.and this bra is perfect for it, and also really flattering.  i also love the deeper v of the neckline, since yoga shirts tend to be lower cut than what i wear for the average cardio workout, etc.
188828	good quality stay cool bra. while not lacy, it gives sexy looking fit with it's deep v, separation and rounded natural shaping.  breast stay securely put in crossover design. love not having my breast smashed together. they don't even touch. each breast stays put in it's own cup.  the fabric is soft. the fit is comforatable.  top portion of cups have stretch, bottom portion does not. i like as an everyday bra, not as a sports bra.  i don't think this  will give long lasting support if breast are really heavy. too much of the cup area has stretch. i have a few glamorise bras, but will purchase several of this style for everyday wear. i like the comfortable fit,  and they way i look in it, both before and after dressing.many glamorise bra styles runs small, but it may be best to stick with your regular size, if ordering this style. the back doesn't ride up, even if breast are heavy.  the label isn't rough and scratchy either. the mulitiple d cups have 4 hooks in the back.last note, i needed to snip a little piece of lining,  from underneath front of strap. the strap was slightly curling. that fixed the problem.
188852	love these.  comfortable, soft, and you can't see the panty line through the pants.  the only down side is that it stretches out after you wear it, and it feels a tad big.  (i'm a m pant size 8, and underwear size 6)  it fits like a dream right out of the wash, but like everything else, it stretches as you wear it, and it gets a little loose around the crotch.  but these are still the best boyshort underwear i've ever gotten.
188854	they fit really well and even pulled the tummy in a bit.they feel really nice also. i'll be getting more.
188885	i love this watch.  the bands are just the perfect color for many of my outfits.  it is the perfect accessory.  very easy to read the time.
188926	this skirt has a weird fit, and doesn't fall in a flattering way. also, it seems to attract cat hair a lot. i  don't like it.
188936	i thought the skirt length would be dowdy; the waist either not comfortable or 'gappy'.  i just wanted to try this more contemporary look skirt, especially for casual days to wear with boots.  it fit like a dream, with classy well made lines, and versatile.  couldn't wait to buy another for both my daughter and daughter in law.
189013	i love the look and feel of these boots and they will be a wonderful addition when i have heavy socks on with heavy leggings on a long winter walk.
189026	these came very quickly. i bought them in a medium because i had read the previous reviews of leggings from this seller, stating they run small. they fit, but i really should have gone with my gut and should have gone with small or xsmall. they are stretchy and thin. great to wear on a summers night out. i would buy from this seller again.
189049	if i could give less than 1 star, i would.  i literally just pulled this out of the mailbox... good news is that it came pretty quickly.  bad news, is that it is nothing... i mean nothing like the picture - other than the fact that it has stripes.i would like to state that i have ordered many allegra k shirts that i love.. this is not allegra k brand.  there is no tag, it's short, it doesn't have anything close to these sleeves it's not longer in the back, or even on the sides for that matter.in all honesty, i think the company received the order and had someone throw something together than they thought looked like this.  literally.  no tag.  looks like my grandmother sewed it yesterday, except she had better taste.  so disappointed.lastly, the company had the audacity to include a little card asking that i give them a 5 star review. disturbing.  if someone from the company views this, if they even really care about their rating, i want a full refund.  i'm also putting this as the seller review.
189114	i ordered a medium and was nervous because usually oversees items run small. well this item does not. the medium is probably a size xl. the dress is also sweater material so the banded bottom is not real fitted unless you have a large bottom. overall its ok. its a loose fitting dress but i wont return because it was cheap.
189154	i think that every person is different in their tightness preference. i wish i would have ordered the medium instead of the large. i ordered the large because other reviews said they ran small. however, i was wanted these to wear under other shirts there were sheer. so for that purpose i would want them a little tighter. however, just to wear them alone the large is fine.i'm a solid size 10. 38 c cup and have a little bit of a pooch in my tummy. so, if that is similar to your frame then i'd suggest getting the large for &#34;wear alone&#34; and a medium for &#34;under garment&#34; purposes. hope this helps with sizing.quality is great! i love the longer length. they are nice and thick...not cheap or flimsy. a great product for the price! will probably be ordering more in a medium.
189160	"i just ordered my second pack of 3. i love these! they are really long! i am 5'3"" and they cover my butt. they are perfect underneath another shirt as a layer.warning, they fit pretty snug. so if you want a looser fit, you may want to size up. they also dip pretty low, and sit right at the top of my bra. no adjustable strap either."
189174	these are the most comfortable underwear ever. light, cool, and they have plenty of cotton. i've thrown out the rest of my underwear and bought more of these. i hope jockey keeps making them and adds more colors.
189277	good fit. my wife loves it. i got it as a gift just because. it fits perfect very comfortable, she has other colors of this shirt
189334	i have looked for a pair of shoes like this for many years and finally found them. i walk every day, much of it on sidewalks and paved roads, so my shoes take a real beating and wear out quickly. i am so glad to find this model of walking shoe. they fit perfectly. i now have three pairs of these wonderful new balance walking shoes and am so pleased with the new attractive tan color. now i can wear these with jeans and they look great! thank you new balance!
189375	this is a nice accessory to sny number of items, dresses,swesaters,coats.... the color is muted, but not dull * the fabric very soft.
189385	i dont know what to write to describe sex with my wife on the day she worn it in the evening and came to our bedroom...just try it - this bodystocking is the best thing i have ever seen on a women's body!!!!
189386	very soft to the touch with strong material. will not rip easy and can last a couple of nights. wash it on the delicate cycle and it will last very long.
189464	these are terrific shoes.  i wear them for long distance walking, and they are wonderful!  rarely have i found shoes which were so extremely pretty, and extremely supportive!  i give them top marks.  you can't go wrong with these shoes.
189481	this steve head is basically a box with an insert that has a hole in it to fit the top of your head.  the hole was too small to fit my 14 year old son so we cut it a bit bigger.  also the box tends to move around alot while you wear it, to fix that we inserted bubble wrap behind his head to keep in in place.  everyone loved the costume and alot of people said they wanted one.  this was a good buy for us, because i didn't have the time to make one.
189506	as a boot sock, this is a decent product. i guess my only disappointment is that the &#34;arch support&#34; is non-existant, and that's really what i was looking for. it's ribbed around the arch area, but there's not difference from the rest of the sock, and definitely no support. as far as quality, it's good, and worth the money, considering a pair of these socks retail for over $20.
189537	these were purchased for my son for work.  he really likes them.  they have a comfortable fit with features that he likes do to where he works (food service).
189721	the first day i wore this my daughter asked me to order one foe her, and i will. the button fell of the first day no big deal i just sewed it back on. its nice to look at and i love the style.
189767	ok i thought i was buying a dress or at least a long fitted top but this is a short shirt and looks very different from the picture. i was going to buy the black one as well to wear over leggings but i changed my mind. i don't need another shirt. not what i expected at all.
189773	the boots run smallthe heels are bulky and make a god-awful noise when they hit the floorthey are very narrowthe shaft is far to flimsy to stay upthere is not traction the sole slips on anything and i almost slipped to my death. (i'm exaggerating because i hated these boots so damn much
189958	its pretty but does look a little cheap and for the price you pay, i expected it to be better. still i will wear it and it does add a splash of color when wearing a black outfit. i like it just not for this price.
189981	"i just received asics gt-2000 today as my b'day present. i am disappointed and frustrated that they run half size small and one width narrow and it is made in japan.  if your 2a then get a ""b"", if your a ""b"" then get a wide, if your wide then get 2e, but if your a 2e then, your out of luck they don't make 3e or 4e.i had to send mine back the same day as i tried them on and laced the them in different ways to relieve a wide foot and narrow heel, to no avail there is no give in the shoe as far as cushioning goes and they are not comfortable, plus where the seam is... it hits directly on my scar irritating it and making it angry. i also looked over the shoe and where the tongue is they didn't cut the excess material overhang, i guess the machines missed it when they were trimming.  over all it has an odd fit.  i'll keep searching till i find the shoes with my width and cute color combo.i wish asics would make a 3e and 4e widths for us really wide foot women. they should post on their site that the widths run small and the size runs a half size small. all 'n' all the shoe looks adorable, seems like the size and width are for small feet.i'm sticking with new balance since they are made in the usa and are more generous with the width, but they do run a half size small in some of their shoes."
189989	i liked the color scheme of these shoes, but the shoe itself was not very comfortable. i thought i could wear them walking, but they hurt my feet.  i thought i could even use them for just running around because i love the colors so much, but even that was uncomfortable. i had to ship them back
190160	i've been wearing these calvin boxers for years now. this was my first time buying them through amazon. the price was right and i got a color that i hadn't seen in stores before.they hold up extremely well, are super comfortable, and look great. i fluctuate between a 34 and 36 inch waist and size l fits me perfectly. i don't like the feeling of boxer briefs, and tighty whities are even more snug. this drape nicely, don't bind, and don't bunch up under jeans.
190181	those boxer are comfortable and soft. in addittion to that they are cute, my boyfriend like it. i would like you offer pack boxer in diferent colours.
190271	beautiful little earrings. exactly what i was looking for. these can be turned round and round in your ear. you can even add a bead to spice them up or match an outfit. they seem to be quality, but as they are small, they are still delicate.
190306	i was a little afraid of what i'd get for it being such a low price- but i was suprised to find it was just what i'd been looking for! cute, unique, not too big, and a good length for any hoodie or tee (a couple inches below the breasts). the chain seems okay- i haven't had any trouble with it breaking but i wouldn't pull on it or anything. it definently stands out, a nice fun piece like this is a cute flirty addition to any outfit, from casual to photography-intern attire. can't beat the price, either!
190345	this camera necklace is super cute.  it's a nice size and is what i expected when i ordered it.  the detail is very nice.  the chain looks good with the pendant.
190363	this is just not a cute item when you receive it.  it does not look much like the photo in the description at all.yes, it was very inexpensive so really i am not complaining.  would just like others to know not to waste their time ordering.
190402	i like this it stretches but the size was a bit tight. i wear a ladies 16 and ordered that size 14-16. i hoped it would be big enough to fit; i should have gotten the 18 instead.
190427	but it was cut way too small. i ordered up two sizes as the reviews warned that it ran small. still too tight. maybe this is meant to be form fitting, but i don't want form fitting.if you like tight, then you'd like this. i'd suggest you have a 0 bmi, however, unless you don't mind pudge showing.the sizing is inaccurate, and that is what really bothered me. had to take the time to return it.style, color, fabric are fine. sizing sucks.
190430	arrived quickly. perfect for warm weather on the golf course. fit is adjustable for all.  true color as advertised on site
190431	i am very particular about the hats i wear around the pool.  i need for them to have a wide brim to block the sun and make reading easier while floating in the pool.  this hat works great for that purpose.  also, i simply throw in the washing machine (in a garment bag) and it comes out fresh and looking like it's new.  good deal.
190504	received 5 days early. i wear a 10.5 shoe and i order these shoes base on reviews of shoes running small. i ordered size 12 and after about four hours the shoes stretched and now are a perfect fit. i know these shoes are made in china because they are stamped all over the inside made in china in big black letters. well what is not made in china. i guess i will order a book so i can learn chinese because it won't be long before they buy this country. i wish our government would pass a law requiring advertisers specify what country their products are made in. maybe some americans would even buy usa made products if they new what they were buying first.update 5/9/2013: i wear these shoes everyday and they are still going strong. i updated this product to five stars
190542	these are a little thin, as other reviewers noted, but they are very comfy. my only issue is that i have to hem them, because i have fairly short legs. i'm 5'4&#34; and got the large, but they are still 2 inches too long.
190596	these just fit really weird. they didn't really have a lot of give and didn't fit well at all. so they were returned.
190764	great ring at a great price. fit great to the exact size. i will buy more as i see one i like.
190803	i loved the fit of this jacket except for the sleeves.  they were pretty tight through the bicep and were also long on my hands.  other than that, the fit was perfect.  i would like to have a bit of spandex in the fabric too but that's not much of an issue.  i do think it would have made this fit better overall.  this isn't really a jacket for outdoor wear necessarily, it's more for over a blouse or shirt as a layer.  looks great on, we ride a lot so this will be good to have on under my leather when we go somewhere.  it is close fitting so i can wear it when it's not very cold and it will not beat me to death on the back of my bike either.  i'm looking forward to getting a lot of compliments in this jacket!
190960	i was in the market for a new rolling bag. my criteria was as follows: i definitely wanted a spinner. anything other than a spinner would not be considered. i also wanted something lightweight so that i could lift it into the overhead. i was specifically buying this bag for short, weekend-ish trips involving plane travel.a friend of mine who works as an it consultant and flies weekly recommended ricardo beverly hills. i had seen her using a ricardo spinner (different from this one) when we were in an airport together recently. after some research, i decided to go with this bag, and i am not disappointed!!!first, i love the hard sides. it gives me some confidence that this bag will hold up. secondly, the spinner function is so fantastic. i have used the expander and not used the expander and find that the bag does not tilt or fall over. in fact, it is very sturdy when it's standing up and i do not worry about it toppling over. i tried to concentrate on putting heavier items towards the bottom of the bag when packing, but ultimately that went right out the window when i had to figure out how to stuff all of my things into it.it doesn't look like a big bag when you open it up. i initially thought &#34;good god, how am i going to get anything in here?&#34; yet, with some creativity and my puzzle skills (*snort*) i was able to fit everything in for a long-weekend trip.as to the weight of the bag, no problem. my bag was stuffed to the brim with my things, and yet i had no difficulty whatsoever lifting it into the overhead bin. i got the usual &#34;do you need any help with that?&#34; offers from several gentlemen (thank you, guys!) nearby and i happily responded &#34;nope!&#34; as i lifted my ricardo bag into the overhead with ease. speaking of the overhead, it fits great! no problem at all. it slid right in to the overhead bins on two delta flights while other people were pushing and shoving their bags in. the ease of use and lightweight factor are the two things i love the most about the bag, besides the spinner feature.after roughing through several flights and numerous overhead bins, the bag still looks pristine. i also really love the different storage spaces on this bag. the inside has a mesh compartment which is perfect for smaller items, and then of course it also has the shoe compartments.this was definitely more than worth the price i paid for it and i loved the bag so much that i went ahead and bought the large 28-inch spinner to match it! i highly recommend this bag if you're in the market for a small spinner. a+++
190961	i love this suitcase.  i have used it for >10 trips and it is holding up very well. i am a light packer, but i can easily get 5 days of clothes in this.pros:hard panels offer great protectionlooks greatspinner wheelsexpandable zipperlots of space with compartmentscons:although i have not had any issues with the wheels (spins/rolls just fine), i wonder about the durability. i guess only time will tell. otherwise, no other complaints!
191018	my 2 year old loves wearing this hat and riding her rocking horse.  the only downside was the string laced around the side was left hanging long (maybe its supposed to be this way).  i tied it and cut it off, to remove  any temptation to chew or wrap it around.  i also removed the chin strap, just because i didn't want her catching it on anything and choking.  in another year or so, i wouldn't worry.  either way, it's a cute hat and it fits well, but still has enough room to grow into it.
191024	the watch box came 3 days early thank you ,its very nice fits my large watches ,something i was afraid of ,but no it all works good thank you for your fast and easy service
191034	my earrings arrive early. they were not 8mm posts, more like 5-6mm and were a darker blue than pictured. i was hoping for a lighter lapis, but the silver is nice. with allergies to nickel, i can tell :) they fit well and stay firm on my ear. works well for me.
191058	very impressed with these.  was looking for something to wear with my boots that wouldnt make me feel like a stuffed sausage.  these fit true to size, comfy and have a good stretch without giving you flat butt.
191088	i ordered these boots because it's difficult finding shoes to fit my wide feet.  i am very happy with how comfortable they feel.  i can actually walk in these without my feet hurting and they actually look pretty stylish.
191099	these are absolutely the best shoes i've ever owned. i work at a desk and every time i got up i felt like they were massaging my feet. great arch support. you deserve these shoes!
191107	not simultaneously, of course.  but as a former professional thespian, i have worn more pairs of heels than even most fashionistas.  these are by far the best made and the most comfortable, without sacrificing attractive looks.  they're the first shoes i've ever worn that my husband declared he &#34;loved&#34; the moment he saw them.  he said they looked gorgeous on, were flattering to my legs (i am overweight), and that i walked better in them than out of them.  i had to agree!  if i had the money, i'd get some in every colour they make.  they're also great for those of you who love retro fashions.  a perfect 10 in my book!
191120	i'm in my mid-thirties and wanted a good looking boot that was also comfortable.  i have the miz mooz black books with the little buttons and now i have this boot in brown.  i love them both and they look great with skirts, leggings, etc.  i wore the black boots last year right out of the box with no issues.  i ordered my normal size (7.5) and they fit perfect.  i highly recommend these boots.
191162	these are wonderful comfy nice smelling happy socks- i got them for my birthday love them, wore them to church as i cover for modesty when working with the children and they get a big tickle out of the diff socks i wear.
191176	these pants are very stretchy and comfortable.  the material is a little bit on the thinner side but still durable.  i was slightly concerned they would be too long (i'm 5'3&#34;) but they're fine for me... maybe a tiny bit shorter and they'd be perfect, but overall the size & fit are great.
191238	my wife was complaining that she did't  have any more comfy pants . so i took it upon myself to go ahead and look for some . i came across these and the reviews seemed to be good . well--- first of all , she was thrilled to pieces when she received a package (for once its not me ). second--- she opened the package and said that they looked to small and there was no way her (amazing) butt would get into those . so she tries them on and comes into the bedroom (thats where i just happened to be) and she turned around to show me . ( i really gotta stop writing now before i start getting censored ). the pants look amazing on her . she is 5 ft 4 and weighs about what a curvy woman should weigh -- about 155 (ballpark figure-no pun intended) . i bought her a medium --- (she first told me she was in a large yoga pants , but i knew that they'd be wayyy tooo long )--- i got the medium based on reviews . --- per-fec-to !! her body looks very flattering and hey--- its not that i'm happy , but -- she;s happy !! i did good !! i get a treat now !!
191259	it's a super cute purse.. but part of the strap was like not completely sown on correctly i had to fix it myself, but i havent noticed any other flaws. it's roomy and cute.
191346	this belt fits great.  it does not roll like some elastic belts and has the added bonus of being reversible with black in it.  unexpected happy surprise
191355	i love this lace back cardigan. i bought this to wear at a christmas eve party and luckily i read the reviews before purchasing because most of them said this piece ran small and they were not exaggerating!  i usually wear a 1x so i was going to purchase a 2x but they were sold out.  the only size they had left was a size 3x.  i figured because of the style of the cardigan if it was a little to big, no one would notice so i bought the 3x.  the 3x was actually a slight bit to small, so make sure you buy at least 2 sizes up from your usual size.  everyone at the party, including myself, thought the cardigan was gorgeous!  i am very pleased with it.  if it was not for the sizing being so far off i would definitely have given this item 5 stars!
191375	i bought this dress as a hospital dress for my delivery day. i am 5'3&#34; and 9 months pregnant (37 weeks and 6 days). i weight about 160 right now and my belly is really big. this dress is long and fits very well while being pregnant. because of common comfort issues while being pregnant, i wear a strapless bra with this and it goes very well. i am currently a 36 c (was a 34 b before being pregnant) and the dress helps keep my bra in place without making my breast area look like it is suffocating. can't wait to wear this on delivery day. i plan to buy more as i am planning on breast feeding and this type of dress will be easy for me to do so (with a nursing cover of course :) ).
191453	i like the quality of the dress; the detailed beading is so intricate it had to be done by hand, there is no way a machine could do this kind of work. there are ties at the back to cinch the waist and the straps adjust if you need to shorten or lengthen. the color of the green is not too bright nor too dull, the color is just the right shade. the dress is made in india and since it is cotton/rayon hand wash in cold water with wool light, hang dry. the weaving irregularities and the shade variations are the characteristic of the fabric and in no way to be taken as defects.  i got l/xl and fits perfect (12/14).i highly recommend this seller 10%! thnx! :)p.s. i am eyeing the steel blue.
191458	it is a beautiful dress with gorgeous embroidery.  unfortunately, the bottom hem fell out after hand washing it just once.
191472	i am very happy with this dress-the fit, design, and color. i ordered a green size l/xl and it fits well. i am 5'5&#34; and weigh about 150 and am curvy. very flattering!
191491	"this dress was very pretty and has a nice slenderizing fit which i found very flattering.  my biggest complaint was the damp feel this had upon arrival, as well as a smell i can only describe as chemical or dye.  i returned this because the color was uneven when i pulled the drawstring to tie the bust.  it had very obvious white sections without color.  i ordered the s/m and the fit was great (5'8"" tall, 140 lbs, 34d)"
191500	i have bought about 5 dresses online in the past few weeks, and each one was a bit of a disappointment (like &#34;eh, it's okay but...&#34;), but this dress i loved from the moment i put it on. when i first opened the package, i was surprised by the pretty details on the material of the dress itself, some of which you can't even see in the picture. i'm 5'6&#34; 180 pounds  cup size c/d and i ordered the l/xl. it fits perfectly. sufficient coverage on top, not risque at all. the fit is very flattering, very slimming to the belly. being 5'6, it comes to about where the picture shows on the model. i ordered the navy blue and after trying it on for 5 seconds, i immediately got online and ordered the same dress in red. i may even send the rest of the dresses i bought back and get it in a third color! rare to find a dress that fits so great and is so flattering! the best part is, i believe even if i lose or gain a little weight, this dress will still be flattering!
191616	this is a cute top. being a 38dd the fit is perfect. if you are much larger in the bust be careful. i will hand wash/drip dry because most gauzy tops like this will shrink. the black/white is beautiful. i will match it up with black leggings. great for around the house. the price is good. it looks just like the photo. thanks
191630	very comfortable we order three of them and wow do i love this shirt, for the price you can not beat it!
191651	i am 5'6, 140 pounds, physically active and this shirt looks hideous on me. it is not as long as the picture indicates, and under the arms it shows all. the shirt flows outward, right at the hips. it is made of lite material and is pretty, just not long enough to wear as shown.
191657	pretty shirt, odd sizing. if you have big boobs and you go up a size, the shirt lays awkwardly. if you get the size your normally ordering, your boobs get smushed and yet the bottom flares out. gave to a friend
191664	great top fit perfect, as i am no bigger than a 38/40 d in that area.cant wait to wear it with my white capris with a cute pair of sandles.hope this helps....
191667	i love the style and fit of this blouse. after two washings it is falling apart on the sleeves. i handwashed it as recommended. i am going to return this item. i want more, but the stitching is very poor but beautiful
191681	beautiful bathing suit, a little too small for me (5'4, 170lb). the neckline was a little too low for me, but it does have adjustable straps.excellent quality, color and detail!
191697	i have a pair of regular go walks that i love, so i thought i'd order these for the colder months.  my feet just freeze in the winter in the others.  so i ordered the same size for these as i'd ordered in the past for the regular go walks.these fit just a little loose, even with a medium wool sock.  they also pull my sock down - not clear into my shoe, but enough to be annoying after a while.  they are fairly warm, but not as toasty as i thought they would be.  they also are not as heavenly comfortable as the regular go walks, but are still pretty good.  i have arthritis in my feet, so comfort is extremely important.  i wore these out yesterday for about 4 hours of shopping, and after about an hour my feet were quite tired.so these are good, but not great.
191705	this shoe is perfect, got it a little bigger than i usually get these shoes because of the furry lining and it was a wise choice because it fits perfectly and so comfy.  absolutely love them!  great shoe as usual from skechers.
191740	it is a cute and different watch and the color is great to wear with jeans or the all-occasion. the band is flexible for my small wrist so there is no need for the removing of links. i seem to go for this watch on most occasion as it fits so nice. the price is what made me take a second look and purchase it. i did not expect to really like it as much as i do. i keep going back to look for more of these fun watch with the flexible band and the great price.
191757	i also own ebags and eagle creek (the classic ones) packing cubes.  when i saw these, i thought they were small compared to my other packing cubes.  however, they expanded substantially when i filled them up!  i was able to pack 7 pairs of underwear in the 1/4 cube, 7 - 9 pairs of sport socks in the 1/2 cube and 9 t-shirts, a pair of yoga pants and a pair of shorts in the cube.  (the pants and shorts were folded flat and placed on top of the rolled t-shirts.)  i was surprised how much clothing this set set held!  with the addition of 2 pairs of pants/jeans, shoes and toiletries, that is basically all i need for a week's travel!  these 3 cubes fit well in a carry-on bag with room left over for the pants, shoes and toiletries.  since the cubes are so lightweight and take up almost no space, i recommend getting a spare cube.  you can bring it with you on your trip and fill it with dirty laundry so you don't have to mix clean and dirty clothes in one cube.i agree with the other reviewer that it's slightly more difficult to get to the items at the bottom of the cube since the zipper does not open around all three sides like the other eagle creek or ebags cubes.  however, as the silnylon fabric is much lighter weight and softer than the ebags or eagle creek cubes, it would not be able to hold up its sides if the zipper opened on all 3 sides.  the resultant trapezoid pouch without the zipper keeps all 3 sides up and gives the cube its shape.  once you have added a few items, the sides around the zipper can stay up better for easier loading of the rolled clothes.  unless you over-stuff the cube, i was able to reach my clothes in the trapezoid pouch area without disturbing my other clothes.  therefore, this &#34;less than three sides zipper&#34; issue is balanced out by the lighter weight fabric.  i highly recommend this set!  if you have dressier tops and pants, you can get one of the eagle creek folders.  the pack-it 18 folder is a perfect fit for a carry-on.
191773	"ok so the sizing info chart says a 2x is an 18/20 .. i wear an 18 . my 13 yr old daughter is model thin and wears junors jeans size 1! yet when my package arrived i couldn't squeeze into the bottoms i took them to my daughter and said just for laughs try these on.. she put them on and they were baggy but they should have fallen off her if they were a realistic 18!! i call total bs on this product especially being ""plus size"" .. i will never order from this supplier again. i'm very disappointed with this purchase"
191794	they were too big and i didn't realize the color i ordered was an ugly dark brown, in the photo it looks black, but it's not! very ugly, i do not recommend these.
191816	this is a revision of the review i did when i received my muk luks. after having worn them for two/three days i find that they have increased by about two sizes.  and because they have stretched so much each time i put them on my feet create a new pattern on the very thick spongy soles.  i don't like this feeling. since i have worn them and stretched them i can't return them so it is my bad, however, i would advise everyone not to purchase them. but if you do buy them, order them at least two sizes smaller than you normally wear. and don't worry when you put them on and they seem too small. after a couple of days they will be ok.
191885	bought my usual size 12 but the sizing of these jeans are off. at least 2 sizes smaller than a true 12. very disappointed.
191955	i made a mistake when ordering and sized her pants by her tops. wrong! i returned and received the proper size,,which is womens plus size 18w short or petite. she loves them and the fit. from a 1 to a 10= 10
191964	i wore the headband all day and did not get a headache.  i usually don't wear headbands at home for the simple reason i get headaches very easy.  i put one of these on when they arrived and did not take it off until i went to bed.  i almost forgot i had it on.  the price has gone up since i bought mine, but i still am thinking of buying two more sets.  one as a backup for me and one for my grandchild.
191986	"these things are really great. i forget i'm wearing them, they're that comfortable. the arms of the headband curve back in a really smart way, so the headband sit flat against your head, instead of digging in to hold on. think when you perch glasses on the top of your head -- they work a lot like that.i wear them when i work out, and they don't budge. i also wear them with glasses every day, and they don't get in each other's way.my only complaint is that they break relatively easily. i forgot that i had one on last night as i pulled a shirt on over my head, and the shirt pulled it back and off my head. i thoughtlessly grabbed it to untangle it from my shirt, and it snapped in half. i literally said, ""nooo!"" out loud. (my boyfriend, alarmed, came in to find me standing there with what was apparently a hilariously sad look on my face as i held the two halves in my palm, shocked.) i broke another one a while ago when i pulled its ends apart too enthusiastically. whoops. it seems like they could so easily be made stronger, but i guess they're so cheap and light this way -- and i'm sure planned obsolescence plays a role, too.but whatever, they're barely more than a buck apiece, and they work fabulously. i'll happily keep buying them as long i continue my clumsy rampage of hair accessory destruction."
192008	very pleased with product. ordered a size 6 , (usual size) and the length was perfect, no adjustments to be made. i did alter the hips by 1/4 of an inch as i am not a curvy dirvy.  i have a bit of a belly but they still fit me as they have some stretch .these jeans suits me fine being 5'4 and 135lbs. straight legs that aren't skinny and aren't baggy, what more could i want? go for your usual size i would say.
192042	i bought 2 of these for a 24 year old couple. one is grey and one is pink. i was worried about the sizing because it is kind of hard to understand -but it worked out perfect. i ordered an xxl for my 6 foot 5 inch thin guy, and a medium for my 5 foot 5 inch thin girl.they are cute and comfy. only problem so far is the little traction dots on the bottom of the foot are coming off. but they dont care they love them.the extreme softness and comfortable factor helps you to ignore that problem!
192118	i bought a size larger than i would normally.these pants are really soft and comfy. i am 5'10&#34; and the legs are perfect on me. really super nice and comfy.a short person might have to have these hemmed up.
192120	good sturdy pajama bottom that i would recommend to friends. size up at least one size.  the pockets gives it an awkward fit
192134	i just love this colorful tote.  fits my personality to a &#34;t&#34;.  the medium size is perfect.  well-made and sturdy.  i expect this to last.
192140	very nice bathrobe, clearly well made (not cheaply).  the label doesn't state country of manufacture, but i'd say it's almost definitely not made in china - quality of fabric and stitching too high.  i think this will probably be a good year-round after-shower bathrobe.
192151	i bought these because they were all cotton. the combination cotton and synthetic pajamas made my skin itchy and felt lousy to my skin. these were perfect. good weight fabric, very very comfortable and the draw string waist is much better than snaps or buttons for comfort and fit.
192153	purchased this + 3 other shirts from amazon for a new friend who is quite large. he is quite pleased and we are happy to see his self-esteem improve, thanks to having a wonderful product that fits. thank you to geoffrey beene and amazon for offering something of quality and helping us to help this nice man.
192190	cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap cheap. so not worth it. at all, in any way.
192194	firstly, i want to say, i got my sandals 2 days after ordering-- extremely fast, and much faster than i expected. i am super happy about that.now about the sandal itself: it's very cute and built sturdy. better quality than i anticipated for the price. i have a similar pair i bought a few years ago from another retailer for more, and these are significantly softer than those.i'm excited to wear them. they don't feel as if they'll come apart quickly or anything of the sort.i am a size 5 so shoes in my size are hard to come by generally.i decided to write a review being that i was on here ordering another pair (brown).love gladiator sandals. they work well with jeans, skirts, and dresses.i am happy with my purchase and recommend it for all!
192197	they are cute and cheap. the size runs big. the straps are great bit they are a pain to put on and take off often. i suggest getting a size or half size down. good material though.
192259	the pants i ordered fit (xl ... i wear between l & xl), the reason why i will return them is because i cannot lift my leg without feeling resistance on the knees (i.e. can't really move freely).  for my purposes (fleece pants for the winter inside of my home with pockets), the  russell athletic women's fleece midrise pant fit/felt better.  otherwise, the quality was fine, just not for me
192311	i did not like the quality of this boot.  for the price, they look cheap. however, returning them was a breeze and very easy.
192359	this was a great deal from warehouse deals.  these shoes were sold to me as &#34;used&#34; but when i got them they were in perfect condition.  they were a little too wide so i wear thick socks...great for colder weather!
192361	i love easy spirit shoes.  traveltime i always buy an 8w and they fit perfectly.  but these were too big in length and width.  i was so disappointed,but i will try them in a smaller size bc i think they look nice .
192385	nice looking shoe but they are anything but narrow.  they are wider than my new balance regulars.  new balance fit me much better but they are all jazzed up for kids.  i wish they'd bring back their adult sneaker clogs.  easy spirit &#34;look: the same but they provide less support and never have a nice snug fit - on me anyway.  too easy to turn the ankle.
192524	these shoes are not up to the usual joan & david standards.although the shoes are lightweight and the soles offer decent support, the material the shoes are made of is really stiff and does not give much when walking.  the shoes run very narrow in the area where the decorative band runs over the top.  given the stiff material the shoes are made of, it doesn't seem likely that the shoes could be &#34;worn in&#34; a bit to soften them up.and oddly, even though they are extremely tight in that one area, the shoe runs on the long side in length.additionally, there are multiple frayed threads on both shoes.the extremely narrow fit was tight enough that it my feet are still hurting from it -- ten minutes after the test walk.  these shoes were returned.
192608	i am pleased with this top because it is comfortable but it's nothing fancy. good for workout or hanging around the house.
192627	the chain is very small and thin. it looks good but it is definitely not worth more than the $6.00 they're asking for. you get what you pay for...
192780	i'm a size 10/12 woman, about 5 feet tall, and have a b cup chest.  this bra didn't push me up in any discernible way, although the padding slightly enhanced my size when compared to an unlined bra.  the cups were entirely too far apart for me, and i think the center gore needs to be significantly stronger in order to successfully enhance your cleavage.  this wore exactly like any other bra for me, which was fine enough, but not what i was looking for when i purchased this.i'll be returning mine, because i found the back closure to be incredibly uncomfortable.  i could feel the hooks digging into me the entire time i was wearing it.  it's attractive enough, i guess, but that wasn't reason enough for me to keep it.
192786	my wife has always been a victoria secret girl, i purchased 3 of these for a total surprise trip, were i bought an entire weekends wardrobe for her, she likes them more than her super expensive vicky's bras.  did not believe they were only $15 each.  she's had them for about 3 months now and they have held up just fine.  she doesn't put them in the drier, lets them air dry.
192860	my 3.5 year old has wanted an umbrella for quite a while, and i wanted something made for children that wouldn't have any sharp metal pieces that might poke out. this one fits the bill and is really adorable at the same time. very easy for her to open and close it as well. she likes to sit in it with her stuffed animals and so far it's held up.
192867	i was disappointed with this item. i actually bought 2 for an overseas trip. neither me, or my husband, felt this was functional.
192868	i tried this out on a trans-atlantic flight and it really comes up high over your cheeks and mushes your hair.  it is difficult to get the cord to clip together and cinch tight enough to do the job.  the cinch cord has two individual cinching toggles that snap together - but they don't always stay snapped and are hard to get cinched.  instructions say you can also reverse it so that the thing snaps behind your head -- i could not get that to work at all.i do like that it is adjustable and you can inflate or deflate to your liking.  the cover is very soft.  rolled up and in its pouch, it is about the size of a soda can.  there is a fastener on the pouch so you could attach this to the outside of your luggage if you wanted to.it is more compact that a non-inflatable pillow.  it is better than an airline pillow.  it keeps your head from dropping forward, but it has its flaws.
192903	these slippers felt a little strange when i first put them on, but after an hour or so they were so comfortable.  recommend for anyone with foot problems.  they keep my feet warm but not hot...a plus.
192915	i have a 6-1/2 size foot and order a 7 to be sure. i can hardly get these on my feet and am returning them as soon as possible. they are not sized correctly.
192922	runs supper small dubble  whatever size you want to wear... then walk around and feel like a giant. blah blah
192946	i love this hoodie. comfy. stylish. great color. the fit is a tad bit larger, but after a wash it would probably fit tighter which i don't mind. what i don't like so much is the zipper which seems a bit rough. i'm careful when zipping up because it gets caught up sometimes and i feel like it will get messed up. it won't stop me from getting another hoodie though!
192969	this picture does not do this watch any justice! it is very outstanding, very functional and the price is awesome! i get so many compliments on it.  great buy!!
193001	i love the look of this watch. great price.  a couple downfalls but nothing too bad. especially for a $10 watchpros:  great look, looks like a more expensive watchcons: the tik is pretty loudthe rubber pieces that hold the band down fall off easily, lost one in the first day, once the second gets lost ( which it eventually will). i'll have to scrap it
193028	i love heart watch necklaces.this some what antique look gets me many compliments.i love the look, and will buy more as gifts
193036	i purchased these for cold days when i spend a long time on my feet.  i thought they would be cozy.  they are very lightweight and easy to slip on.  however, they're harder than i imagined and not quite as comfortable as i had hoped.  i'll keep them but can't wear them all day.
193069	after reading the specs/reviews along with past experience with man made leather belts, i must give this one a thumbs down. this is not good combination for several reasons. real leather expands & contracts according to temperature & humidity from the human body as well as being stored your clothes closet. real leather also takes patina appearance over a period time, after being worn . man made leather can't do this. a good quality belt will last many years.
193104	gorgeous peacock, but the chain i only expect to last once or twice.  for the price, i am happy with it.
193232	this was a gift for a friend and she absolutely loves it!  it's very pretty and eye catching.  it took a while to get, but that's to be expected.  no complaints.
193304	i like this, it looks very vintage. i like the colors and the peacock. i haven't worn it yet, but plan on it.
193318	yes, it stretched out my leather clog, but one broke the first time i used it!!! i almost couldn't collapse the device to get it out of my shoe! i thought i could twist the pieces back together and &#34;fix it&#34;, but the handle just turned and turned and the part that &#34;widens&#34; never expanded again. returned! :(
193323	i love dresses and got a hankering for one with authentic mexican styling.  i don't know how authentic this dress is (it probably is the real deal) but i am very happy with it.  i wear it and feel very comfortable.  the dress does look more frumpy and housedress-like than fashionable; the sleeves could be narrowed and the length could be shorter.  for what i paid for the dress, these are alterations that i would gladly do with my own sewing machine.  it's exactly what i wanted.  the material is pretty rough and i hope that softens over time.i said, &#34;like&#34; instead of &#34;love&#34; because of the sleeves, length and material.  but i can live with all those features.
193340	husband is a slim man and the extra large was tight and short...we ordered up in prep for some shrinkage  too bad because he really liked the shirt but it was uncomfortable after washing.
193372	purchased this bag as a christmas present and so far it has been well received. it is fashionable, durable and holds a bunch of stuff that is needed and not needed.  i like the fact that it has a zipper so hands cannot easily enter the bag.
193480	i purchased this bag thinking it was unique and just the right size, it was a shame that i had to make a return .  i knew the bag would be large, not huge!  lol!  if this was anything else i probably would have been pleasantly surprised but it's a handbag and i wanted a certain size and color. also, along with being too big, the bag seemed a little cheap looking and shiny which in my opinion would have made it stand out even more.
193497	have been looking for a shapewear for a while and after reading reviews about a few of them on amazon. i have decided to take a chance on this one. i have never bought any undergarments online.the reviews that said to get one size up is true to the point. the product arrived on scheduled, and i love the curvi shapewear. i bought a one size up, it fits perfect and love the strapless feature. i would also wear the top as outerwear.i bought the black checker and now considering getting another one in different color.will recommend this shapewear.
193514	i got these after my doctor suggested i wear glasses to protect my eyes. i have 20/200 vision in one eye and better than perfect vision in the other. he said that if anything happened to my good i would be blind and handicapped for life, that i should get a pair of clear non magnifying glasses for everyday wear. i also have a pair of reading glasses as i have become farsighted in the last year or so and in comparison these glasses are much better made and better looking. they actually cost a fraction of the price as the reading glasses i got.honestly i have gotten compliments from young women on these glasses often. three times in the last four days alone. my wife says they give me a hip intellectual look. i think she has gotten nervous or jealous as i have caught her hiding these glasses a few times since the one girl was actually flirting with me when my wife walked away but my wife overheard the conversation. bonus points, wife jealous, i'm innocent at 43 feels good to have a young lady in her early twenties flirt with me, feels even better for the wife to give me extra attention because she saw the twenty something was interested in her man. these glasses may have been the best investment i have made in a while...i'd probably be better off protection wise if i got a impact type glasses like safety glasses but these offer some protection and still add style. i may get a safety lens set of sunglasses in the summer but for most days these work fine...
193530	you can't beat sunglasses that are only ten bucks. these look really cute, and are meant for an adult. i know some of the other cat eye sunglasses on amazon got reviews saying they were too small as if meant for a child. the only reason i gave 4 stars is because the glasses don't fit tightly to my head. i do have a smaller head, but these are very wide. they don't fall off, but i like my sunglasses to feel secure. other than that, ten bucks! very cute. i like em!
193593	this costume was great but the knew pads were ridiculous!  they should have been sewn completely into the costume not flopping all around on the edges. even though it was a little on the long side and problems with the knee pads, my son still loved it!
193620	very comfortable. not too shear, but nice over sports bra. snug, just a touch too short. i might get a size larger next time. i normally get med-large. i bought medium in this shirt, probably buy more but large.
193659	this shoes / model are one of my favorites, they are so comfortable, i do not want to use another else.very good quality, the price is high but it worth it.i love it.
193666	it's a little bulky with the shorts underneath the skirt but it's well made with good material and very comfortable.  it looks good and wears well.  i wear it a lot.
193751	i like the fit of this dress. the one thing is the color is not a bright, pristine white. the color looks like when you have a white shirt for a long time and it starts to fade white. or better yet the color looks like a white shirt you made a mistake and washed it with a red shirt and now the white shirt has a permanent slight pink hue to it. it wasn't a deal breaker for me but for those who are expecting a brand new crisp white color, you will be disappointed.
193755	this outfit looks cute in the picture but, when i got it, it was like see through. i was expecting it to be a little thicker. not that it looked terrible i am just not that bold to go out with such risky clothes
193760	"thought this would be sexy on the boat this spring/summer without being trashy, and i was right, this is a very cute cover up. i purchased a large and i am 5'5 and 166 pounds. the cover up is a see-through outfit, so you will have to wear a swimsuit underneath.  i purchased the white cover up, and it looks very cute with my white bikini underneath, it covers any flaws you may have especially the tummy area, making one look trendy, slim and most importantly ""sexly conservative"" ...i know ""sexly"" is not a word!...but is some how fits, you get what i am saying!"
193785	i love, love love it.  very classy, charming, and looks beautiful on the chain.  i also love that it is sterling and not silver tone.  does not disappoint.
193789	the color of the pearl set is just what i wanted. love it very much. when i wore it a number of people admired it.
193825	very confusing fit.  i ordered the 512 straight leg in a size 22 because i already own a two year old pair in size 20 but they are a smidge too small. unfortunately the size 22 straight leg style was way too big, and the overall style of the cut was not the same, it was much wider in the legs etc.so i returned them and ordered these, 512 skinny style in size 20, and they are still too big! the fit is much closer to the old 512 straight leg fit that i already own, which is great. but the fabric is really really stretchy and soft so when i bend over they stretch and inch down a lot and the world gets a peek at what underwear i have on. i have to hike them back up once standing again.not to mention that when you walk they slowly creep down with each step. i have to keep pulling them up.  unfortunately i've already worn and washed them so i can't return them. i'm contemplating getting them in an 18 to see if they fit any better.
193831	"nice jeans!!!  the rise is a mid rise.  straight leg...which is tapered at the end.  the streatch in these are great.  order your normal size and they fit like a dream.  the length is medium.  which i am 5'1"" and is a little long on me...but i wear dansko shoes and still a little long but doable.  the color is a very dark black which is very nice and slimming.  i love them...you won't go wrong with this one!!!!"
193903	gorgeous earrings, light and can definitely be worn everyday.  the only reason i didn't give them 5 stars was because of the size.  i prefer a larger hoop, but i have nothing negative to say about the earrings.
193943	it's a job to get this on, but once you do it works great! it would be great if the straps were adjustable! but it does the job and (once you get it on) it is actually comfortable!
193997	i trusted everyone's reviews before buying these shirts and the gamble paid off! it is true what everyone is saying; they hug you in the right places. it is so hard for me to find a way to look sexy in casual clothes due to my curves. i am used to looking good in dresses and leggings, but the simple top, blouse, and jeans look rarely accentuate my curves and often cut me in half and show my flaws. as stated in my other reviews and future reviews, i have the size 6 to 8 body with some curves here and there that i want to show off, but have trouble doing so without the expense of showing the muffin top or little pooch. these shirts do exactly what i had hoped! showing the bust, hugging the waist, but not at the belly. and you can runch them at the waist or pull it down to lengthen, both ways will be flattering.other reviewers have complained about the sleeves being too long, but i have short arms and it is no problem. they push up perfectly and stay in place; but will work well for a tall girl too. you can also play with the arm style; keeping the bell sleeve appearance or tucking in the cuffs to make them look shorter. and the fabric is warm, soft, and comfy. i have them in both gray and brown. when i first pulled this shirt from the package, i was slightly disappointed and thought it was going to be ordinary or unflattering. but when i put it on; wow! i have now ordered 10 more items from patty and can't wait to get them! and it only took 5 days for them to ship to me from hong kong to texas and during the week before christmas! i live in europe so i will see how well the shipping works over there when i get back home. i love you patty!update- the grey sweater has a bit thicker material than the dark brown and kept me so warm during an unexpected layover in toronto that required me to walk in the december snow on the tarmac without a coat. kept me comfy during my 36 hour journey requiring lots of layovers. and then my friend told me that i must have lost lots of weight during my 3 month stay in the states, which is so untrue (thanksgiving and christmas food for weeks)- but the sweater made me look thinner- showing the chest and hugging my waist.chocolate brown sweater- super duper soft and feminine as well. maybe a tad bit larger than the grey but unbelievably soft and super girly. i do not think anyone should really go up a size. if you are in between sizes like i am, then go for your larger size.
194007	sort of disappointed in these slippers.  they look very cute, but don't have much foam in the bottom and are not made as well as the normal dearfoams.  also saw a nicer quality of the dearfoam at kohl's this weekend for $10 and so now i feel like i overpaid for these.  the fit is also a little tight, but they do stretch out quickly.  i wear a size 8 and bought a 7-8 and at first felt like these were way to small, but they strecthed out within a couple days.  however i wear my slippers everyday and i think i will have to buy new ones within 6 months.  i gave it 3 stars instead of something lower because they are very good looking in person.
194027	first, i'm glad i didn't get the 3 karat ones. i wouldn't want these any bigger. i've only worn these with my hair pinned back and they seemed a little garish, but i think if they are partially covered by my hair it will be more the look i am after. keep in mind i prefer yellow gold (needed something to wear with gifted white gold necklace) and cannot &#34;do&#34; bold jewelry.
194028	i ordered two pair to wear everyday in my 2nd and 3rd earring holes.  so, they were just a tad bit too big for my taste. but, that was my fault for not checking the measurements.  otherwise, they were beautiful earrings.  i'm not technically big on diamonds or jewelry overall, but i can say that these were gorgeous and sparkly and i could'nt wait to wear them.  they definitely catch the eye and are pleasing to look at.  my valentine's day gift to myself.  also, they came a day early, so that was even better.i will update this review after wearing for a month or 2.
194040	they are really pretty and cut.  they are beatiful.  i love swarovsky cristals, it is such a good brand; to me means quality, elegance at a very good price.
194068	the stones are beautiful, but they definitely don't add up to 3ct. it's more like 2.5ct. also the gold setting is so cheap. this product will easily bend or break. they are going back. sorry, really was hoping for something better. but i still love amazon!
194077	i like the size of the earings and they look great. good price and go with everything i wear. recommend them
194191	"the geneva rainbow watch is a super fun and cool looking watch.  the rim of the face studded with ""diamonds"" and the numbers are bright and colorful.  the band has a tie-dye effect and is also super colorful."
194243	i am not a junior, but do order junior stuff occasionally. i am usually size 7 in junior products and this particular product felt really tight. i still wear them, but i wished there was more room. if you are on the fence, i would say, order two sizes and then return the one that doesn't work. also, these don't really stretch out with wear either. i've been wearing mine for about a month and laundered them at least twice and they don't &#34;grow&#34; the way other pants &#34;grow&#34;. overall, recommended, but do try out a couple of sizes, especially if you are in between sizes.
194252	i love 512s and 515s and a couple of their skinny jeans.  i wear a size 10, sometimes an 8 even depending on brand.  now these are cute but sheesh!  i could barely get my feet and calves in.  luckily they have some stretch and also that i ordered up in size.  they are juniors so i guess a slimmer fit should have been expected.but even when i was a junior i always had muscular calves so i would have still had a bit of trouble getting them on.  i say if you like them, definitely size up by at least 1 if not 2 sizes.  these are also a thinner denim, just a fyi.
194259	i usually wear levi 525 skinny jeans (6s for shoes, 6m for boots) so i thought i would try their legging for a change.  i bought a blue pair locally (6s - i'm 5'1&#34; and 115lbs) which fit perfectly and look great with both flats and my blunnies.  so when i ordered these i also ordered what i thought were 6s's.  i apparently ordered a 6m in error.  well, the fit is still perfect (didn't need to size down like some other reviewers said to do) although they're a few inches too long (i'm a bit vertically challenged.)  definitely not a deal breaker though - it's nothing a few quick stitches on the sewing machine can't handle. easier and quicker than sending them back and exchanging them.  until i get around to doing that i plan on folding them up and/or under.  over looks good (even for an old girl like me @ the tender age of 60) and they're also tight enough to stay under.  i have to say i am very happy with these and sticking with my normal size.
194286	these pants are great quality, however i am normally a size 14 so i ordered a 16 since most reviews said they run small...but they don't.  they are true to size.  exchanging for a 14!
194363	not happy with purchase! upon receipt one of the watches does not work. thankfully they were very inexpensive.  i will not buy this brand again!
194385	pretty bag, the color is just as it shows in the picture, it seems a bit bigger though, which is fine, however im not very please with the material, it doesnt look like its gonna last, but for now it looks fine.about the seller: bag poorly packed, horrible seller, they dont really care if the customer receives the order or not and the emails were useless, if amazon doesnt work their magic my bag would be only god knows where... i wont purchase anything else from this seller that's for sure.
194423	great halloween costume for the price!  this is almost december and my grandaughter is still enjoying the costume; all this week she asked for to put on the costume when she wakes up in the morning and she'd wear it all day.
194451	i was a little worried about ordering these from the mixed reviews. some say they're too big or too small or they come up high on the waist. some say they fit perfectly. i bought a different pair of similar pants from a different company and when i tried them on, it was like sliding into paper pants. they were scratchy, uncomfortable, thin and would bunch up everywhere. i just opened these today and i must say, i'm extremely happy. they are comfortable, stretchy, and hug all the right curves. i'm 5'4 and 125lbs and these have been a pleasure to wear. i usually have such a horrible time finding pants that i like on me but these are great. i'm actually considering buying more pairs in different colors!
194457	super tight, but that's what i was going for.  will look adorable with some heels and a cute shirt.  i bought medium (i'm  127lbs 5'6&#34;) and i think after losing just 2 pounds they will be absolutely perfect.  i will be buying more colors for sure
194461	i do like these pants but really wish they were a lot tighter. i am 5'7&#34; and 135lbs. i am skinny and thought a small would be perfect but just not as tight as i like. i do like them though and still wear them.
194463	i was hesitant to order these but the size runs true and the fit is amazing. can'twait to wear them out.
194471	i had read reviews and many of them suggested to order a size up, so that's what i did. what do you know, i have to wear a belt with them or they slide down very very quickly, but like i said my fault. i guess a lot of people on here are under the impression they are smaller then they think. other then that they fit great and look nice, just have to wear a belt. order your size as this company does get the sizes right. the pants are super comfortable and great to wear all day, to work or casual. i will be ordering more in different colors. the seam under the zipper came undone after about a month, but easy enough to sew as i caught it right away.
194477	bought these along with &#34;exofficio men's give-n-go boxer brief,ocean,medium &#34; to try out.  these are much better, don't ride up at all, and cheaper than the exofficio.  they are more expensive than a typical hanes or fruit of the loom, but worth it!  hopefully they last just as long (or longer) than a typical pair, making them well worth the few extra bucks
194488	the champion boxer briefs fit good, and stay in place. after 6 washings they still look, and fit like new.
194546	i am a high school teacher and spend a lot of time on my feet. years ago i owned a pair of skechers comfort walkers that looked like this style of shoe. they were by far the most comfortable dress shoes i have ever owned. they felt almost like sneakers.these are not those shoes. they fit well, and they look nice, but they feel like dress shoes. the soles seem kind of hard, not at all like sneakers, or my beloved comfort walkers.i gave them four stars because they are good shoes, look nice, and fit well, but the comfort walkers were the only five star shoes i have ever owned.sigh.
194730	buying birthday gift for my teenage daughter has always remained a tough task for me. she is very particular about her style and picks jewellery after lots of window shopping. so, i would consider myself lucky that while browsing internet, i came across this exquisite alex and ani expandable wire bangle bracelet, made of brass. i further got inspiration knowing that it is a recycled item and reasonably priced too. the design is trendy and the charm is much thicker and resilient. the bracelet can be adjusted as per your wrist size. my daughter just loved the fashionable look. now, she wears it not only at college but also loves to flaunt it at parties and outings with friends.
194741	fit is not as described, the fit and length is poor and i was unhappy with the handling of my return, they are in china and it made it difficult to communicate as well as return, you have to pay for it to go back but it is international, with the price of the item it is not worth the hassle, and i am stuck with it
194783	the small piece of luggage fits well in the overhead of an airplane, just make sure you put the wheels in first (the suitcase will easily be removed this way and fits better).  the only real negative is there is nothing to grab onto at the bottom of the luggage when trying to lift it unless you use the wheels and that is a little awkward.  all the luggage holds quite a bit of clothing etc.  i really like the luggage and they have been great so far.
194802	as i found out boys in college don't use roller bags. lucky for me as i took it on a short trip and it was perfect. the compartment is a roomy cube of space that makes packing folded clothes very easy. the zipper opens wide so you can view the contents easily. it is simple and functional and held alot more than i anticipated!
194809	"[like]- big opening of the main compartment- the zipper opens on the top, in the upright position- color is pretty (i purchased purple)[don't like]- no shoulder strap; it's too heavy to lift with 2 short handles- only 2 wheels; wish it came with 4 wheels- too wide for the aisle on the plane; you gotta lift it and carry it sideways; if it came with 4 wheels, i wouldn't have to lift it.but more importantly, it didn't fit under the seat on boeing 757-200 and 737-800 if you sat in an aisle seat.  so i've had to ask the guy in the middle seat to switch seat with me, which he happily agreed, but i wasn't happy.  i had to sit in the middle seat for the long 6 hour flight from ny to las vegas.you also can't ""stuff"" this bag because if it gets too fat and bulky, it becomes too tall to fit under the seat.  i've had to take a few things out of the bag to make it thinner so it fit.at the end of the day, there were more 'dislikes' than 'likes'.  the reasons for dislikes were too much to ignore.  the fact it doesn't fit under any seat; the fact that i can't roll it in the aisle on the plane; the fact that i have to be careful how much stuff i put in because it may not fit under the seat.  it just doesn't meet the purpose, so i won't recommend it."
194812	my previous bag was too heavy and bulky for me to handle easily. i can fit clothing for a week in this bag and still manage getting it in and out of the airport and rental cars.
194834	i ordered this suitcase to go on an upcoming trip. it is very well made and has several pockets. the color is a pretty berry color and the fabric is thick and looks like it will hold up nicely. i like it very much.
194842	this suitcase is very lightweight but seems to be pretty durable.  luggage is typically very expensive and you don't always know if you're paying for the quality of the product or the marketing behind the name.  i have always had good luck with samsonite products, and american tourister is a samsonite company.  workmanship and materials used on this bag seem to be very good.  it's a nice size for carry-on.  there are many nooks and crannies, all with zippered openings.  all in all, i believe this is a very good value for the money.
194873	perfect sized travel bag. i packed for myself and my 4 year old for a week in this bag. and it held up at the airport quote nicely. i was pleased with how well it survived it's maiden voyage. lots of compartments and places to put things. very good quality.
194982	my bead looks nothing like this picture. mine is clear with very faint hearts on it...also no little tendrals that come off from the top of the hearts. disappointed  with it so much ..i took it off my bracelet. it's okay though if you like my description of clear and faint colored hearts...then go for it.
194993	i like this bead...made nicely, good quality, but a little too big for my taste....i still love the bead selection here at amazon...
195006	"i received my product quickly, which was great. they are super thick and sturdy, and the ziploc closure is quite secure. would be a good place to keep your money and other (limited) flat things you want to keep dry; would probably hold some cash, sea pass and passport without problem.my package came with 6 and 9"" attachment pieces (it stated upon request by users). i think the 9"" is too long, but suspect it was a plus because the encasements themselves are so large. we're cruising rci and could have placed three luggage tags (side by side) into these babies. not a big deal i suppose. and perhaps i'll use them again on another line with larger tags someday. :) but the 9"" attachments accommodate the big ol' tag holders much easier than that 6"" ones, which are a struggle to finagle through when affixing to the luggage.all in all, they'll certainly suit the intended purposes. i'm not going to attach until post-flight. while the attachment mechanism seems quite sturdy, it seems if stretched with enough force, it could snap. also seems that a sharp object (which i don't know what that would be at an airport, lol!) could cut it with relative ease.i simply plan to slip them in with our cruise contract docs and affix them the morning of the cruise. :)bottom line, glad i bought 'em. would do so again."
195054	this arrived, and i have to say it feels and looks very cheaply made...did you see what i paid for it?  i guess i can't complain!
195073	i bought this for my neighbor who already had the earrings....she was very excited to get it, and has worn it many times.
195109	i got these ballet flats in blue, and wow do i love the color! it's one of those colors that can go with just about anything. and they fit true-to-size. i haven't worn them (besides around the house, like we all do when we first get our shoes in the mail), but so far, around the house, they seemed fairly comfy. i'd recommend these!also, the seller was pretty speedy with the shipping-- another plus!
195127	i ordered a size 7 and its perfect fit. a little stiff but once you wear them in its good.
195275	underwear.... medium fits great at a 34&#34; waist.good fit on the legs, they don't bunch up when i'm running, keep you fairly dry.solid at the price.
195319	i've only had them a couple weeks and can't wear them to work.  but my feet just feel so good when i walk in them.  it's kushy and support at the same time.  thinking about get a pair of the clog type that i could wear to work
195322	i bought these to accommodate my problematic plantar fasciitis heels.  while these are well made and i like how cushiony they are i find the arch to be too high for my feet.  i'm hoping they squish down and conform to my feet after a few wearings.  i'll keep them but won't order them again
195355	i normally love anything enzo.  i took a chane with this shoe.  it is made of a fabric upper and is a little rough to the feel.  the width of the shoe is large (especial in the middle).  not please with the look or quality but will keep the shoe to wear with summer dresses.
195404	i have several pair of the 512 skinny jeans.  they fit me well, the waist is high enough to cover belly flab ( ack) and they don't flatten my butt.  they are medium length which is a bit long for me at 5'6&#34; but i use velcro dots to hem them up.  i know the length will come up after a few more washes.
195442	these shoes are great, but they are a little harder to break in than the same style that isn't patent leather. a few blisters later i have an adorable pair of shoes. recommend, but beware of a couple days of break in time.
195485	very cute, pretty dress with a hem that hits at just the right part of your legs to emphasize the thinnest apsect of your thighs and make them look long and slim.  however, the dress is very sheer (read: anything but incredibly nude undergarments will show) and it has a large, bulky, metal (not cream or coordinating color) zipper all the way up the back.  so when i looked at myself in the mirror from the front, all i saw were panties despite my best efforts to conceal - and the hemline is too short for me to wear this &#34;commando.&#34;  when i did the over-the-shoulder look to check out my backside, the bare metal zipper contrasting with the pretty cream lace just glared at me the entire time.but if you don't mind a large metal zipper and the sheer factor, then this dress does have beautiful lace, has a flattering cut which coordinates in a modern fashion with the lace, and again a hemline which emphasizes leg length (plus!).  some women have the figure and the ability to go completely bare under a dress such as this; i am not one, and sadly have to return this pretty one.
195507	normally i wear a size small and was looking for a cute dress to throw on all summer  i was completely let down by the fact that this dress didn't even cover my butt.  on top of it fitting more like a long tank top, it was practically see-through and poorly sewn, with seems and crooked cutting of the hems everywhere.  my husband actually called it a whore outfit when i tried it on.  to make matters worse when i tried to ship it back i was told that i'd have to pay for shipping back.  making my refund a measly $6  save yourself the shipping and poor customer service; just buy something from wal-mart.
195534	i am a size 12 and am 5'6&#34;. i like these, they fit great. fabric is somewhat thin, so can't wear as leggings.
195540	"i would definitely not say these are leggings but footless, opaque tights.  there is a big difference as leggings are thicker and should be able to be worn on their own.  these were capri length on me and i am 5'7"" and an 8/10 on bottom.  they were also on the low rise side.i may give up on buying leggings here as they all seem to be too thin or poor quality.  and i buy a lot on amazon, too bad for me i guess!"
195621	these cheja sandals neither support nor even hug your foot correctly.  ecco's other model - yucatan - literally helps you walk and supports your feet very well.  yucatans are the best sandals among ecco lines and any other brands.  i hope ecco will stop making this cheja and add more colors to yucatan.
195677	beautiful bodysuit but is way too short in the body and 2xl is more a large petite.  it is very disappointing, i really wanted to wear it.  the adjustable straps were at their maximum extension.  back it goes.  another strike against larger/longer structured women with $$
195686	only needed a little extra to fill out dress pants and jeans.  these are perfect.  don't feel bulky and my husband says it is natural looking which is good enough for me.
195770	this shoe meets my expectations...it fits well and has great support.my wife thinks it looks pretty and neat with jeans..haven't run much in it but so far so good.
195781	i love these shoes. they are really comfortable and fit perfectly. i have been using them for a few months and they are holding up very well.
195835	i love these shoes! the color is wonderfully fun! best of all is no more shin splints! thanks so much for a superior product. they came really fast!
195860	i ordered this skirt and one other. i was so excited when my package arrived. i ran upstairs to try it on and discovered it was not true to size. maybe it was the spandex, i don't know. i ordered a size larger and it fits great.s.d., ohio
195886	i just got this skirt to wear for my husband, it fits great and has the perfect amount of stretch and stays where it belongs no matter where my husband puts me ;) he asked me to get another one, yay me!
195977	i ordered several allegra k products and overall this dress is the least flattering.it came with a long run in the side and frayed thread, something that would be fixable.the way this is cut is just... no. i think what allegra k should be selling is their photography services because i have no idea how they made this dress look that good on the model. the upper white lace area is just an enlarged boob bag. it's frumpy and does nothing for your shape at all. this largeness extends to the sides and back of the lace area so theres just bunches of fabric at the top with no where to go. the top part is like wearing a tshirt 4 times too large where you cant tell what is your body and what is material.the pleated lower part comes in right at the breast not at the waist like in the picture. i couldn't imagine it looking good on anybody as it begins to flow out right under your chest in all directions.this dress is actually longer than i anticipated, i am 5'5 and it almost reached my knees. i ordered a large but in all areas i would say this is too large, i wear a 14-16 pant due to gigantic hips.the top is very sheer and even if worn with a white bra you can see the outline of it.overall i just can't really fathom any way of wearing this dress, it is possible that if you are too thin it might look good on you because it will give the appearance of a larger body but for most of us this is something we want to avoid.
196003	this shirt is cute but is smaller than expected. im a busty girl (36 ddd) so i bought a large and it's a little snug. i'd love it if i had smaller boobs, but i wore it under a blazer and got a lot of compliments.
196034	this shirt would be great if they sent the size i ordered it in! i will not be ordering another for their mistake.
196060	i assumed it would be longer on me then the model, but it was still too short to be considered modest. it was super cute though and doesn't seem or look cheap at all. the belt is sort of hard to buckle though. i gave it to my friend and it looks amazing on her. so if you're busty but somewhat thin order a medium. i would recommend it.
196083	thanks to the seller, they did great. i however don't like the dress or belt, all feels way too cheap, and i'm not picky in general, now i'm stuck with a dress that i don;t even know to whom i could give.
196086	i would have loved it if they hadn't messed up my order yet again!!!  i ordered a medium and they sent me a large, which is huge on my 130 lbs. 5 feet frame.  the fabric is excellent, the color is accurate, the belt is pretty, overall the dress is perfect.  the only thing i am not happy with is how they sent me the wrong size.
196089	this dress looks exactly how it's shown on the picture. it's beautiful and i've gotten many compliments on it =]the belt also comes with it, but the belt is a bit too bright, so i just wear it with a different cognac colored belt.i love the material too, chiffon!
196236	this looks good on paper but it looks cheap on mine smelt like smoke and i got to wear it once before the belt broke i don't suggest you buy this item save your money
196238	okay so to start off this is a beautiful sheer blouse and i think it was worth the money i paid. it took 8 days to ship (from hong kong to california) and about 2 days to process. i ordered a xl which was way too big however. i would say go down a size. this shirt is baggy as some other people stated, and as in the picture it looks. it did come as it looked and described. but as for the color it was a dark red. i was going to send this back to get a smaller size so i contacted the seller, but to avoid shipping costs back, the lady suggested i kept it and gave me a 30% refund, which i thought was nice. this blouse is a pretty little thing. i like it, it will look cute with leggings since it is so baggy, but hey a plus on that i realized is it covers your crotch with leggings because its long lol :) if only it were the right size id love. but i like!
196454	i have a thing for peter pan collared blouses. this is adorable. exactly as pictured, color and style. it's not super sheer, but does require a tank if you don't want your bra visible. the sleeves hit at the elbow. it's long enough to wear outside of skirts or pants and perfect for tucking in as well. nicely made, doesn't feel or look cheap.
196465	do not buy this blouse. it is very thin, bad quality and it doesn't look anything like the picture. as soon as i took it out of the plastic wrapper, i was so disappointed that i told my son to put it right away in the box that we are giving to the salvation army.
196467	i hate this shirt!  it fits like a poncho.  it pulls itself up around my neck and in the process pulls itself up off my waist.  it's not relaxed like on the model at all.  i took it off as soon as i put it on and threw it.  i will never buy anything from this company again.  yes, and btw, yes, i did buy the correct size for myself according to their sizing chart.  awful!!!!
196468	the material is good quality, the size fith perfect. i was afraid of size, quality and model and the time delivery but everything went very professional. i recommended!
196537	this is one of the cheapest made products that i've ordered from allegra k. it's very thin, cheap polyester. not so well made and fits like cheep hooker wear. don't do it. you can't wear it on the street and if you did folks would wonder. if you wore it round the house, you'd better live alone. (lol) but who would want to?? i put mine in the good will box.  i could't put zero stars so i guess i have to check one star.
196545	el vestido no era la talla que encarguevenia descosturado el vestidono lo recomiendo a nadie es una mal producto
196552	"this ""dress"" is not a dress at all. i ordered a large, and everything i get from them is a large and fits perfecty, but this was very very tight, see-through, and went a little bit past my stomach area. it isn't a dress at all. don't waste your money on this. i waited like a month for it to come in and now i don't know what i'm going to do with it.i am 5'3"" and this went just a little past my stomach. i am not tall, i am model height in asian countries. it just isn't a dress."
196578	depending on the cut, i normally wear a 4-6 i ordered a medium and it fits nicely... a little loose as expected but not too baggy, i can wear it pulled all the way down like a dress or pull the bottom up just a little and wear it with leggings. the material is on the thin side but not terrible, overall i'm very happy with the purchase and i received my order in 10 days!
196637	this top is knit and looks a mess. i guess i thought the top striped part would be sheer. just wrong.
196657	i ordered this shirt in an xl. i am glad that i did. i wear a 16-18 in a dress, i am a 38dd. my waist is very small, and my shoulders are broad.  i am 5'10&#34;. the top is very slim fitting, so get a size larger than what you normally wear. it is very form fitting, so if you have any stomach, or &#34;pooch&#34; it will not be flattering on you. i wore this with a  pair of high waisted shorts, black lace tights, and high heel boots. the top of the shirt has a blouse &#34;feel&#34;, but the bottom is more like  a t-shirt &#34;feel&#34;. great for the office, or for a night out with the girls. the top is very flattering on my hourglass figure.
196746	i wasnt sure what i'd get when i ordered this shirt, but when it came, i was pleasantly surprised! the fabric could be better, but for that price its perfect. fits and looks great. i've gotten compliments when i've worn it to work.
196798	horrible and my my is a seamstress and i order all the time from this company look at all my reviews and they wont even get baxck to me anyore i'm going to amazon becuae i refuse to keep these horrible dresses this one and the floral printed lined maxi dress
196836	i have not bought this particular dress, but i buy a lot of clothes from allegra k. i hope the maker sees this review every time i see this dress i want it, it would be so perfect, but i am not a size xs. please make this in a medium. thanks
196848	the dress seems to be an imitation of the photo here... at least that's how i feel... the belt isn't what it looks like and the dress has a lot of static... i guess it's the material and i'll need to work on that static... wore it out once, without the belt, since it looked a bit cheap... not sure if i want to wear it again... maybe i need to be that thin (as the picture) to have the look? lol
196950	the top i got was way too big and it was in a nylon-sporty material (like work-out shirts).  it was a cute cut, but with the size and material; i can't wear it.
196958	i was so disappointed in this one for i need a white one.  it was sewed wrong on the netting  on the sleeves,it was ugly.  i am at this time going to keep the blouse for the shipping  is more than the blouse is worth.  i don't know an adult  that wears this size. i have a black one like this one  but it is a large and fits really good.  i feel the seller  saw that size  l in the white shirt neck  and mistakenly sent it  it to me.  anyone just looking at the blouse would know it was not a large.
196993	the material is great and feels so good on my body! it's a little bit bigger then i wanted it to be but still i will wear it many time for sure. and it's really good shirt for the price.
197040	nice fitting tshirt. good material, thick. nice color blocking trend. and bonus, it has pockets! i would suggest buying it for this price.
197111	this is a fantastically comfortable top, i got it a little large to wear around the house. the material is stretchy and pretty light. i'm not sure why the &#34;happy cat&#34; looks so sad, but i feel happy enough wearing it!
197146	the fabric is really soft and for my personal taste i would've liked it to be a little more light weight, they really splurge on fabric with this piece
197150	i received a lot of compliments wearing this. it's cute and comfortable. you will look like a very girly girl wearing it! :) happy with the product
197197	in love .. soft fits perfectly im 5'5 and weigh 142 but im pregnant and its nice and loose and long fits with tights  or cute jeans .. note this is not a good sweater i i purchased a large
197220	5'3 and 120lbs. i ordered medium for a comfy fit. its very comfortable and def cute. a little smaller than had expected it to be... if you want a loose fit like the girl in the picture has i suggest going a size bigger. i however like the way it fits a little tighter. :)
197231	i use this top as a quick throw on whenever i am in a hurry for grocery shopping. it well as a casual top and it washes well.
197238	ok i love love love this item and so does everyone who has seen me wear it.  it is light weight and long (fits over hips) and is just what i've been looking for to pair with my yoga pants this fall.  looks equally awesome with leggings and/or jeans.  i will be ordering another one in blue/gray.  package arrived much sooner than expected which was a nice surprise since shipping details stated 2 weeks to a month.  i received in 11 days after ordering.
197244	got the shirt/dress today. i'm 5'2, 145 pounds, bust size ddd so i got the xl. fits perfectly. it's pretty loose on me. love it. can wear it as a dress or with jeans.
197311	i love this dress! i don't think it makes me look boxy, it does seem to be more of a slouchy style. i bought the large and it fits great. it is really soft and very warm! it looks great with some lace tights and a pair of cute boots. shipping took about a month, but that's obvious with where its being shipped from! once the tundra weather over here melts away, i will be wearing it in the chilly spring weather! love this, great purchase!!
197532	like the shirt overall. took off the flower as its overpowering and was pulling on the fabric. have worn it and it is a tiny bit big. sure it will shrink in the wash. buy a little bigger as it will shrink.
197563	i got the dress for an friend of mine and she told me that she liked the material as the looks.
197571	i am a very tiny female with a small bust and buying dresses for me is always a hassle because i always have to pin something and constantly pull the front up. this dress was a really close fit for me, it was just a little loose around my stomach but everywhere else fits pretty wonderfully. the fabric is very comfortable and lightweight. the dress itself is a bit plain but with the right accessories it could probably be a big hit. as for shipping, it arrived a week before it was suppose to which made me a very happy customer.
197576	this is a great dress for the price! it's on the shorter side, measuring (flat, in the center) 28.3&#34;/72cm. it's shirred on the side and you can choose if you want to wear it longer or shorter. the fabric is soft and very decent quality. the ruffle on the shoulder is ok also. the only things is that, unless you want to wear it super short (to my taste, at least), it doesn't mold perfectly to the waist - but this may also be due to my particular body shape. it's really a nice dress, classy and sexy at the same time, i'd recommend it.
197683	it is so difficult to find cute modest clothing. this shirt is made perfectly and fits perfectly. i love it
197789	you get what you pay for.  instead of the red led numerals, they are off-white, which are difficult to see, especially in the daytime.  the strap is not solid black, but rather a &#34;mesh&#34; type, with holes.
197811	first off i'm 5' 2&#34; and roughly 150lbs. yes about 15lbs overweight. i ordered two large black camisoles. i'm 18 years old. i love cami's underneath my clothing. they are thin and i can breathe through them, that is nice. i just wish they had a shelf bra and were just a smidgen bigger. so if you're around my height and plan on wearing them by themselves. i don't recommend. but for underneath clothing! it's a huge yes. i hope this was helpful.
197955	love it! i just got this and a globe with binoculars yesterday and i love them both!but there are two things to keep in mind! this is &#34;cheap&#34; jewelry. the quality is not that of something you paid $20 for so you can't be extremely rough. however, i accidentally snagged this necklace on something and tugged hard because i didn't realize it and it still didn't break, so this stuff definitely isn't cheap in the sense it's going to break easy but all the same, don't be rough. secondly, anytime you buy low end jewelry, whether it's 50 cents to $10, always put a coat of clear nail polish on it so that the color doesn't fade and also so it doesn't make your skin turn green. that's the magic trick. enjoy and i highly recommend this item and lots of others from this company - i've got a lot more on its way so keep your eye out for my reviews (:
198053	when i first got this i was so excited because at first i thought it was prettier than the item picture....then i took it out of the package. part of the feather is missing, the bigger blue gem is poorly set (that is, glued on crooked), and the worst part is that the feather is held on by a big ugly blob of hot glue
198144	i really liked this item it flows very nicely.  i chose it specifically for the sinch waist, and i did not take that into account.  i usually wear a 10 so i ordered a 10, i could have probably gone with the 8 because it would have shown my figure off a bit better.  the fabric was not as vibrant as the picture, but that is probably a good thing, its more toned down but still very eye catching.  i recieved a lot of compliments while wearing it.
198158	the length was appropriate to the size. the quality and workmanship is very good. i ordered the gray and am happy with it
198165	i wear a size 12 shoe, and buying regular socks supposedly for shoe size 6-12 is a frustrating disappointment.  so, i finally went on line to buy wigwam xl and they fit perfectly.  i'm smiling now!
198184	these might be ok, but i don't know. they were too small for me. i ordered an xl which is normally a great fit for me. i'm about 5'11&#34; and 240 pounds. so, xl is what i always order. i'm chubby, of course, so i just wanted to warn those of you who are thinking about ordering these: yes, if you look like the guy in the picture and you have a 6-pack, then perhaps these pants will do a great job showing off your body. or whatever. but if you are a chubby guy like me, the xl was way too small.as a comparison, my wife picked up the wal-mart version of flannel pajamas. same size (xl). i was swimming in those. we had to wash them to get them to shrink a bit, and she offered to take them in if they were too baggy. strange how different different companies view the size &#34;extra large.&#34; so just beware, i don't know if these are good or bad, but you might want to consider going a size up from what you normally wear.oh, and the material seemed very thin. i'm starting to think that dockers is for people who want the brand more than comfort and quality. oh well.
198188	wish they would put the weight (in oz.) of the flannel on such items. i like this but would have preferred the weight of nautica's. these are not all that green, by the way. they sure are relaxing and quite cozy, and that's really what i wanted.
198261	i received these pajamas during a lightning deal.  i noticed that the price is similar at 50% off, and they are worth it.  i purchased hue pajamas last season which did not fit well.  these are much improved from a size standpoint.if you want them baggy, purchase the next size up... but, these are long legged and have a reasonable waist length.  (they hit me at the low waist, but they don't feel very short waisted like last year's model.)the fabric is a waffle like fabric.  i really like that it feels thin, but is warm (which surprised me considering the weight.)i will wash in cold water to protect from shrinkage.  fyi... i wear an 10 pant and a 12 blouse, and purchased the large.  they have just enough room.  (and i'm 5ft. 7in.)i hope this helps.enjoy!
198286	was looking for a gold watch with a little sparkle. this is the perfect &#34; going out on the town&#34; gold watch. fit perfect too. did not have to remove any links like i usually do but may be too snug to fit the larger sized wrist.  i usually opt for the 7.5 to 8&#34; wrist sized bracelets so was surprised this fit me perfect. love it!
198302	my mother in law saw my wife wear a watch like this and wouldn't stop talking about it so i bought her this one, she loves it!!!!
198335	i'm not going to give a lengthy review.  it simply does not stay in place.  really.  this is not worth your time.  it looks intriguing.  don't get conned
198419	these tags are great. they are made of a hard plastic which are very durable. to get to the tag is not difficult but hard enough to prevent anyone from trying to take it out in hurry. other reviews have complained about the smell but i had to actually put my nose to it to smell anything and even if, if is rubber, obviously it would have a slight smell. they are all bright and big so it doubles as a bag marker. overall good product, would recommend!
198441	i went a size larger due to the fact that i have read on so many other patty shirts that they run small. well, they don't. they are made to hug your figure and are made of amazing quality. these shirts are not made to hide lumps, they are made to accentuate what you have. they are very flattering and insanely comfortable. i can't say enough how i love the long sleeves and long mid section that actually hides your skin with low rise jeans. the material of this shirt is very thin and breathable while staying soft and comfortable. it's stretchy fabric makes it easy to put on and comfortable to wear.
198445	i am approximately 5'5&#34;, 136 lbs, 34c, with a slim/fit build. i purchased a small.i really like the style and look of the shirt. the sleeves are quite fitted and the waist fits well. the halter piece and top of the back a bit looser than i would like, though.the halter piece has more to do with my neckline preference. when i put the shirt on, i instinctively wear the neckline higher up than it shows in the picture. i prefer not have cleavage showing like that. i can fix this issue easily by taking the halter in just a little.the top of the back is just a little looser than anticipated, but it is not loose enough that i am concerned that it will droop.overall, i like.
198503	not as slouchy at the top as pictured but still a cute top. also, the pic makes it look like there's some sort of strap but there isn't one.
198532	"alright, so this shirt is pretty damn cool. it's a thin material, and it's really soft. kinda silky. i like how it feels, even though it's autumn now so i won't be able to wear it soon. i almost can't wait until spring! also: i ordered the xl, since i'm not skinny and i have a stupidly huge chest. i'm 5'3, and the shirt comes down almost mid-thigh. i can wear leggings with it since it covers my butt, and although it doesn't look as flattering on me since i'm not a cute size 0 asian model, i still think it's an absolutely great shirt for such a cheap price.important: many people said that their shirts read ""fush"" instead of ""hush"". i was afraid this would happen to me, but it didn't! i suppose it's only a few unlucky people. mine says hush. :)pros: i ordered it on oct 3 and it came today on oct 15. it was estimated to arrive around oct 30, so this is a plus.cons: i can't think of any, but i ordered another shirt with this one and it isn't here? idk, but it may come soon. i think the seller ships items separately."
198606	i am absolutely in love with this dress. it's absolutely adorable on. it fits perfectly. i get compliments on it every time i wear it.  it's a perfect dress for the spring or summer. i am able to wear it in the winter with a cardigan over it.
198672	these were too small for me. they went up to my knee but wouldn't go to my thigh. they are very thick too.
198678	bought these for myself and loved them! so comfortable and true to size! i loved it so much i bought a pair for my mom!!! just a good price too!!!
198736	these are awesome.  the fit is perfect. they are much cuter than even in the pictur.  i would order more in a different color.
198760	my wife loves the concept behind bobs buy a pair and they donate a pair to a child in need. at first she thought this balet shoe was too tight and wanted to get a bigger size - but after an hour of wear - she thought they were extremely comfortable and loves them. i will buy more for her in the future!!
198782	this handbag is not heavy when empty - which is surprising because the buttery soft leather is such good quality. there are numerous pockets and places to keep things in order. this prevents things from dropping to the bottom in a jumbled mess!
198894	"for comparison, they're thicker than the active basic cotton spandex leggings and are better designed around the waist, but it feels more like cotton than spandex and doesn't have much elasticity to it because it's too loose around my thighs (i'm 4'11"", 105 lbs). i've got pretty thick thighs, and the size small fits more like a size medium would for me in the thigh area. perhaps that's the reason why the vertical line looked crooked when i wore these leggings (not smooth and pretty like in the image).other than it feeling a little loose and looking a little funny on me, these leggings would work just fine for yoga or any other exercises. i got both the black and charcoal, and i personally think the charcoal looks better. the black just looks funny because it's very dark (and the vertical line in front doesn't help)."
198903	i bought this for my tom-boy wife who would never buy something like this for herself.  from my perspective, she looks fantastic in it, and i love ogling her in it all day.  the surprising thing is that she seems to enjoy wearing it as well, she has told me that it is comfortable, and not as revealing as she thought it would have been.  she wore it several times this summer on trips to the beach, or around town.  both of us enjoy it for our respective reasons, this item is a real winner.
198920	i usually wear between sizes 12-10 in pants (very wide hips and bottom) and was somewhat nervous about purchasing a mini skirt online, i must say these are true to their size. i have two pair, one leopard print which is a size large, and a black one in medium. the medium fit nicely but was a scant an inch or two too short, i still wear it but have to pull it down quite a bit, so i bought a large and this fit perfectly. i will buy another skirt soon.
199007	when i got these in the mail (rather quickly, i might add), i thought they looked huge! but with a little a & d ointment and a hot shower, i was able to get the tapers through. the great thing about these super heavy steel tapers, is that the extra weight stretched my ears comfortably enough in the afternoon that i was able to enjoy the tunnels by the end of the night! the o-rings are super tight which is a plus, i hate buying extra o-rings. i would recommend these to anyone who wants to get up to 00 from 0; the cold metal also reduced the pain of pushing the tunnels through.
199013	with the rfid alerts i decided to get one of those aluminum credit card holders.  but, that left my wallet and all my id, and  check book in another place.  this rfid wallet solves the problem in a most effective way, and it's pretty to boot.  cards, bills, change, checkbook, all in one place.  that's a good thing.
199069	the fabric on the dress is so soft on the skin, it falls nicely and the belt just tops off the whole look.  the green option looks great the colors are vibrant.  i wear a size 18, but got this in the 16 and it fits great and still has long lenth.
199077	i love my earrings they are beautiful and sturdy i thought they may be cheap but they definitely aren't if you love turquoise please purchase the the earrings
199129	the front of the dress is extremely low cut.  because i don't want my breasts and strapless bra exposed to the world i will be wearing a tube top under it.  i had to remove the padding by making a small slit in the inside and pulling out the padding.
199133	the colors are very different from the picture. it has a cut at the waist that looks ugly. i do not recommend buying allegra k unless you like being disappointed.
199216	i love the bohemian gypsy skirts. they are cotton and are embroidered. i purchased them in two colors, black and green and i am pleased with them and the way they look when i wear them. the lining is short and you can see through the bottom of the skirt, however i wear a slip and there is no seeing through. i am so glad they are available at amazon. i may purchase other colors.
199219	"this skirt is advertised as a one-size-fits-all, but even my 27-inch waist was pinched so hard by the elastic, the drawstrings seemed like an added insult. in fact, it squeezed so hard, that the elastic waist of the skirt created a bulgy ""muffin"" effect. i am not over weight, as i normally wear a small to medium. this skirt is simply poorly advertised. returning asap."
199232	a comfortable summer dress made for those evening concerts or nights on town.you can't go wrong with this dress,one size fit's most.see you at the show.
199244	this shirt is well made and i loved the caricatures.  i got it for my grand nephew (who loves bizarre messages on t-shirts) and he thought it was great.
199260	very impressed with this bag, it's a great carry on and the colors in the picture don't do it justice. the green is much richer looking and the brown is also darker then the picture. the brown handles are thick and soft feeling and has an expensive feel to the whole bag as london fog should. their are two small non-zipper pockets on one side for cell phone, lip gloss or ipod, etc. and on the opposite side their is a zipper pocket that runs the length of the bag for any trinket items, passport, id, etc. the hardware on the bag is a thick shiny gold (not cheap looking). and the two zippers to open the bag run along the top and down both sides to give you plenty of room when opening it. its also a good size, i could probably use it as an overnight bag as a women and a man could prob use it as a weekender :) it's about 16 inches lengthwise, 11 inches from top to bottom, and 7 inches across the side of the bag. but i'm sure it would stretch a bit. i must say i love this bag and want to get the matching suitcase as well. i recommend it.
199270	great value.  gets the job done.  if you shoes are narrow and size 10.5, the medium size is plenty.  if the shoe is wider, use the large.
199300	this is a good value priced watch that is a great value for a dive watch in this price range.the quartz movement is made by a swiss company. it's one of their lower end movements but is still a good quality quartz movement from a reputable swiss manufacturer. it seems to keep pretty good time. the day after i received it i noticed it had lost 5 seconds compared to a clock that is automatically synced to nist servers. since then however it hasn't lost or gained anything significant. it's still 5 seconds off so maybe there was an issue when i set it that isn't related to the movement.a couple nice features with this movement are that you can adjust the date without stopping the time and if you're planning on not wearing the watch for an extended period of time you can reduce battery consumption by up to 70% by unscrewing the crown and pulling it out.there is something odd that can be noticed with the second hand. the small tick marks around the dial may be slightly off. on the right side of the dial, from the 12 to 6 o'clock positions, the second hand lines up fairly well with these markings. on the left side of the watch, from about 7 to 12 positions, the seconds hand doesn't line up well with these markings. the second hand stops obviously between the markings and not on them. this happens when the watch is being held vertically with the 12 o'clock position pointing up and the 6 pointing down. if the watch is turned upside down the variance is reversed. if the watch is laying flat on a table both sides are fine. gravity appears to affect this. it's hard for me to tell if the issue is with the movement slipping a little due to gravity or if the seconds hand might be too heavy or if there is some issue with the attachment of the seconds hand to the movement. this doesn't appear to be an issue with the minutes hand. it's a fairly minor flaw that most people won't notice unless they pay attention.the quality of the construction and materials seems very good. the case is big and heavy and the bracelet is equally nice. it was easy for me to remove links from the bracelet to size it.the deployment clasp is very nice. as well as having a safety it is also a push-button latch. this feature was not mentioned in the product description but it's important to note. maybe things have changed but in the past i recall many affordable priced watches i've seen did not have a push button clasp. the clasp functions well and feels very secure. i don't worry about it accidentally unlatching.the screw down crown is a must for any watch that has such a high water resistance rating. it works fine but i'm not a diver and won't be testing how deep it can go. the only time my watches really get wet is when i'm washing my hands or out in the rain.the rotating bezel is easy to operate and no noticeable play in it. it clicks at every half minute increment.the lume on the markings and hands is not all that great and the glow fades rather quickly.for the money, it's a nice watch if you like the styling. i got it when the price was further reduced as a daily deal and i feel i got a lot for my money. stuhrling's msrp for their watches is over inflated. they explain why on their website but i still feel it's a gimmick to make the watch seem more than it is. same goes for the big box the watch comes in. completely unnecessary. a regular sized box would save money not only in materials but also in storage and shipping. i think a lot of people hang on to their watch boxes for various reasons, this box wastes too much space.this is a good quality watch in it's price point. it's nothing to be ashamed of and there's no reason to try and make it out to be more than it is with a bigger msrp and box. it cheapens the watch in my view.
199329	i got 3 pair of these for my wife and this is the only pair she hates, they were all size 6 but for some reason this pair was a bit small on her , so i gave them to my girlfriend and they fit her and she's a size 6 but narrower feet and bigger boobs.
199354	"backpacks are not ""one size fits all"" in terms of utility.  some need to be light, while others can be heavier.  some packs are designed to carry specific gear - climbing ropes, foul weather gear, lunch, and so on.this pack, the thule enroute escort daypack for 17-inch macbook pro and 10-inch tablets, is what i would call an office or school pack.  there are many packs that fit this category.  here, a pack has to be able to deal with the weight of computers and books in its construction and on the back of the wearer.  i've been using an ebags product, which i like.  multiple compartments, comfortable straps, cushioned bottom.  i've used this ebag while walking, riding a bike or moped, and for international travel.  but i have never been fully comfortable with having a couple thousand dollars worth of electronic gear in it while traveling in rain.  and that's the bottom line, right?  you can drop everything in a reusable shopping bag, but you want some protection to go along with the comfort.the thule enroute pack has a dedicated laptop pocket, and while i never depend on a backpack being truly waterproof with all those zippers and stitches, i respect the pack material overlapping the main zipper, making it more difficult for water to leak in.  i use it with a 15 inch powerbook, so there is plenty of room, and the separate pocket for the ipad is easy to find, even in the dark.  the main compartment will hold a few books, but you won't carry a library here.  and the smaller compartments are okay.  i've really not used the hardened pouch for sunglasses; i just wear them on my head when not in use.the straps clearly were less comfortable than my ebag pack, but i found myself either breaking them in or just getting used to them.  the belt strap is worthless, and i would rather not have these on the pack, hanging down.  i might just cut them off.  the chest strap can be useful when cycling.overall, i am happy with this pack.  it is rather pricy, but protection comes at a cost.  i still keep an umbrella in one side pocket, and a coffee cup in the other, so i am ready for the downpour with either the umbrella or ducking inside a cafe until it stops raining.added note :after six months of daily use, it still looks as good as new."
199359	i absolutely love this dress.  i ordered the blue one and i absolutely adore it.  it's so light and airy and compliments by figure.  this dress is long and flowing, i ordered a large (i'm actually an x-large) and it still fits perfectly.  the dress is true to size however the cut of the dress allows a little more room.  this dress can be accessorized for a more elegant look, or wore casually...either way you won't be disappointed.  i am going to order every color.
199395	as soon as i slipped these on i just knew they were keepers.  in fact i just ordered another pair to put away.update: i've been wearing these to work (where i'm on my feet a lot) and they are very comfortable all day.  i have ordered several more pairs for later in case these are no longer available.
199397	quality, great color but no support at all.  i like them for around the house or short walks on the beach!
199455	i don't like this product because it's too big than it has to be. in the front part, it's too width than it looks like in the picture.
199547	it fits perfectly to her. she feels it very comfortable wearing it. the color is pretty decent and matches with jeans.
199573	this made me feel like a real woman!!!! i'm a sissy and love the feel of soft feminine girly babydoll. the g string really makes me feel so hot. the name of this baby doll fits me perfectly. purple fairy baby doll which is exactly what i am!!!
199641	this top is unbelievably soft!! the detailing in the lace is just stunning! definitely one of my favorites!!! will be great for any weather, very versatile.
199643	after i washed it it shrivled up, and did not keep its shape. sux because it was $30? and i only got to wear it one time
199656	i cant wait to get more of these! the lace was so soft, it is very delicate and should be hand washed. but it is very beautiful in all colors, and great for spring and summer style.
199659	i love this top, it is very pretty and fits well, but it arrived with a tear in the lace, i will exchange it for one that is not torn. this is annoying but does not happen often.
199671	perfect! so beautiful i ordered two more in different colors! i love the flow and how it hangs so softly and perfectly. it's quite a flattering style especially for larger sizes.
199674	it fit as expected but was too short. it should be described as a petite fit in the description to be more accurate..
199677	this top was lovely. the fabric was perfect for what i wanted. but it was cut smaller than the size chart indicated. the sides are higher than the front and back. bad silhouette.
199693	i bought size 4t because i use disposable diapers for my 29 month old who is in 80th percentile for height and 60th for weight and leg holes are too tight still!  waist is fine.  my little one has chubby thighs but they are far from huge.  so i cut the elastic which at least makes them wearable.  otherwise, they are made of great materials...
199792	i really liked the colors, and the style with the rhinestones. i gave some of these for christmas presents. it made the perfect gift to go along wth something else. it is also cheaper to order them this way. a real deal. i would recommend these watches to everybody!
199803	true size. 8m us = 41 european.good as crocs!color is little darker then i expected. any way, fits well, good.
199825	it might have been cute if it fit right. sizes seem to run a little small. i bought a size 2x and it was too tight. yet in most other clothes i am either a 1x or a 2x. so it should have had a better fit. it was a cute top though.
199828	i still really like the shirt its very nice no complaints there but it was ridiculously small! i usually wear a 1x but i thought this blouse would look nice baggy so i got a 3x. it definitely was not 3x it fit like a medium! quite a lovely shirt but runs extremely small i'm very disappointed
199844	pixelated 8-bit clear lens computer nerd geek gamer glasses .these glasses are made of plastic and the lenses are clear. the glasses will make a good gift and they remind you of the classic 8 bit games.
199852	"i think this has to be one of the best looking pair of reebok's in a good long while.  the fit is perfect and are very comfortable to run in.  i've had them for a week now and i have no complaints.  i'm 6'2"" and 180lb and wear a size 11 in men's in other brands and the 11 in these fit snug and seem to be true to size."
199861	bought for a friend. she loves it. wants me to order another one cause she gave it to her sister.
199873	this is a must-have for every day: at home, out in the yard, out to coffee shop, out to walking the dog. very comfy fabric.
199879	it fits as expected and is super comfortable. the material breathes very nicely.it can be a little low cut as it shows in the picture, but if you are in a modest setting, just wear a light under shirt and it looks fine. no one would ever know.  i am so glad i got this. totally worth it.
199886	and very sexy.  the shorts are a bit higher than the picture shows and it has a lot of cleavage so i wear a tang top underneath or i guess it could work with an awesome bra, but it's too showy for me so i stitched it a little bit to keep it shut. i am 1'53 and weigh 125lbs with 34b.
199899	the colour is much brighter than what is shown in the pic. but i think it adds more richness to the top.so it works for me. the gold buttons on the cuffs are also a nice touch. i think this blouse will be a hit when i actually wear it.
199926	the opening of this purse is very small making it hard to access or put anything in it. it's cute, just not practical for my use!
199987	i'm not sure why but the ring doesn't look as good on my finger and it does on line...not sure why.
199989	mine was not the right size.  it is much too large so unfortunately it  became a gift to someone else,  but she loves it as well
200011	looking for a light comfortable underwear i can wear when i work out or just didn't leave lines...these fit the bill.
200015	it is hard to find all-cotton high-cut briefs these days, which is really what i prefer.  they aren't sexy. they aren't cute. but they are comfortable and feel like they will hold up over several washes, unlike the cheap cotton undies i settled for in my last purchase.  i just wish they did a pack of all black that would work best under my fairly thin work pants that show through anything white or bright in color.one note - i used the size chart, which had me go up a size from what i usually would buy and find they really are a bit big.  so, if you are between sizes, i suggest going down a size (unless you like slightly baggy panties)
200058	just as some other reviews stated these earrings are gold tone only. yes, they are nicely made, are light weight and comfortable to wear, but i really hoped i might receive a pair like the ones pictured here at amazon. solid gold tone is not my favorite. the photo appeared to be a mix of silverish, white, black and some gold tone.  if the seller has a pair of earrings like the picture i would sure appreciate being informed so i could purchase a pair. the three stars are due to the color only. the product itself is very nice indeed.
200175	the material is very thin, thinner than a regular undershirt. the shirt is very crushed coming out of the dryer and requires ironing. the shirt is ill formed and doesn't fit as well as even an undershirt. they are only suitable to wear around the house.
200176	great fit; i am 6 foot tall and i bought medium. i bought this to wear under my shirts for a casual look. material is a little uncomfortable (not full cotton), but i'm not complaining much given this price!
200228	i wear a 33 size pants and the mediums fit well. i was afraid to get the smalls because i didn't want to be too constricted. these hold everything where it needs to be so i'm happy.
200322	cheaply made. post won't stay in ear comfortable. back post won't stay put. have to bend it to make it fit and even then it will not fit over ear. won't purchase again.
200336	"bought this coat for my 16 year old son.i think the hood makes this classic stlye jacket a little more ""youthful"". but it also looks nice on my 50 something husband. the hood and the bib also can be zipped off! a little more dressy maybe? my son wanted a pea coat, but the majority we tried were all cut too narrow in the body and shoulders, and going up in size made the sleeves too long. this jackets design is made for the bigger  guy, look at the back of the jacket where it has the the placket sewn down each side,allowing for a better more generous fit than most other styles. my son is 6'2 about 200lbs we bought the xl, fit him great, enough room for for a thermal, flannel or light sweater. he says its warm and he likes the length , it covers the rump area a bit too.the charcol color is a nice and dark ,but i think it is better than black because it does not tend to show lint and fuzzies so bad.decent price at 80 bucks for a well made garment, also it has an inside zip pocket for the phone or ipod! nice."
200398	initially i was appalled at the size but it is a gorgeous pair of earrings. it's multipurpose and i absolutely love it!
200432	these are bright gems and the perfect size. i also bought the black pair as they go great together with many outfits. i'm probably wearing a pair right now as you read this.....after a month the crystals started falling out....
200446	these are a very elegant pair of earrings.  i purchased them for my second hole.  they are a little larger than i am use to but everyone says they look great.  these look like earrings you could get for $30+ in a retail store.  they do not look cheep nor do they feel flimsy.  they are lightweight but that is a pro for me.  due to the cost they do come in a paper bag so if you are looking to give as a gift you will need a box to put them in.  shipping was amazingly fast.  over all i would and probably will purchase again.  these would make great stocking stuffers for xmas.
200456	when i ordered these earrings i thought they looked flat, but they are small balls with pave stones all over.  they are really pretty.
200479	my ears are sensitive to cheap metal earrings and these are great no green reacions. these are great quality for the price and it shipped quickly. small enough that if i fall asleep with them i don't get bothered.
200490	i am a 6.5 sometimes 7. i bought a 6.5 in these and the fit is perfect! i ran 30 minutes on the treadmill first time out and they were super comfy!
200516	this is a very light weight shoe. it is also a zero lift shoe. the upper is very soft. will it hold up. i do not know but it is nice at the start at least. i do not like the fact that the sole wears too fast. the breathablity is very good. i have high arches. the arches are not enough for me. i am not sure how i will do with that.it is different than any shoe you have run in. when you start out it seems old. it is so slow an flat. it is a light weight shoes though. after you have been going a while you will notice you are going faster. you will feel it strong in your upper thighs. the support is very good so you will not feel the road like most barefoot shoes. it does not look like a zero level shoe to me as far as the looks. it does kind of feel like one though. i have not tried this shoe on a long run and not sure if it is wise to. i like this shoe more than any that i have seen. i can not really say why i like it so much. i saw a pair in a store and just had to have them. i have never lost the love affair. i will update later if there are any big changes.
200623	"i ordered 3t for my 35""tall/ 28 lb daughter who is wearing all 3t-4t clothing, and they are enormous. seriously, she could wear two or more diapers under these and they'd still be loose. i held them up to my six year old (44 inch tall/ 45 lbs) and they actually looked too big for her, as well. (we received 2 x 2 packs of solid pink and polka dot pattern fwiw.)editing to add sizing info from the label - but use weight not height in ordering; my daughter might have been ok with the 18 month size even though she's 35"" tall:size 18 months - 30-32 inches tall, 24-28 lbssize 2t - 32-34 inches tall, 28-32 lbssize 3t - 34-38 inches tall, 32-35 lbssince these aren't that much thicker than regular underpants (you will still be changing the pants too if they have an accident) i'm not going to reorder these - just going to do the cheapo fruit of the loom 8 pack."
200676	ordered a medium and i realize the style is to be large, but this is an xxxxl that someone pregnant with triplets would still have room to spare. otherwise i like it. just wish i could get a smaller size.
200680	despite the negative mixed reviews of this item, i took a gamble and bought it.  i should have listened to all of the warnings and i am very sorry i did not.  after this experience, i will most deffinatly take reviews into consideration.1. in this picture this shirt looks like it is very flowy and runs large...it does not.  i usually fit in a large and fully expected this shirt to fit like an xxl based on this picture.  in the picture it has a drape-like look, but it fit me like a regular fitted cotton shirt!  i do not know if the girl in the picture is an xs and is wearing a medium or what...but that needs to be said in the description.  there was no tag on the shirt, so they would have given me any size for all they knew.2.  this shirt appears to be longer in the back than the front and it is not.  it is the same size all around and is cheaply made... threads all around and snag here and there.  the hemline is even crooked!3. worst of all the boat neck is not a boat neck but a regular circular neck line (just like a cotton t-shirt) and it is not centered!!!!!!!!!  it was to the side of the shirt!!!!  you could imagine my reaction!i will never buy from this company again and i am surprised amazon would allow such a company on its site.  amazon should set the bar higher.buyer beware!!!
200805	this skirt is amazing! it is extremely pretty - prettier than i expected from a jersey material. it was professional enough to wear to work, but felt like wearing pajamas all day. the color isn't as bright as the picture, but is the perfect 'coral' color (the picture doesn't really show a true coral). the size is great. ordered a medium, fit like a medium. i probably won't be wearing it as a dress, seeing as the front comes up too high for a 5'8&#34; body, but to each their own.highly recommended.
200823	this picture doesn't do this dress any justice.  the material is a heavier satiny material, which allows the dress to hang so beautifully.  the colors are stunning!!  they're so vivid and crisp.  i have an olive skin tone and naturally darker blonde hair, and whites typically don't do as well on me as ivories, but there's a shimmer to this white that leaves it almost golden and glistening in the right light and complimentary to my coloring.  i think it'd look great on anyone you put it on, honestly.  i'm in between sizes according to their charts, so i went for the medium because i figured i could always wear a bra if it didn't quite fit up top, but i slipped this dress on and felt like a goddess!!  no need for a bra (i'm a 32a/barely b, so they're almost pointless anyway).  i'm pear shaped, though, which leaves me fighting the battle most women do when clothes shopping.  i'm a 0/2 on top, a 2/4 in the waist, and a 4/6 on the bottom.  going with their medium, though, was perfect for me.  i don't feel like i'm trying to hide the things about my body i don't like because the dress is cut to accent everything good about my figure. i am in love with this dress.
200910	absolutely loved this coat when i bought it. fits amazing and looks incredibly. there's just one problem.  after light to moderate wear and a few washes, the closures are all frayed on one side.  the rope holding them in, though cute, is not well secured.  i may still be able to wear this jacket after some extensive repair work, but this is not the quality that i have come to expect from patty . . . incredibly disappointing.
200930	these shorts fit as expected and seem to be good quality. my son likes them just fine and prime shipping saves me a trip to the store.
200938	enough room for my 18-day land and cruise travel to alaska.  i like the two separate pouches.  the smaller pouch i used for dangling earrings and the larger for necklaces.
200995	i bought these all in one color (grey/black) at my local costco for $7.99 on sale (regular price $9.99). here is why i like them.1. very comfortable to wear and fit well. also look good.2. nicely cushioned, but not so thick as to require a larger than normal running shoe size.3. wick moisture well so feet stay cool during running. heel stays in place and so does cuff.4. these perform as well as other running socks that cost double.5. made of 60% polyester, 38% cotton, 1% spandex and 1% rubber.bottom line: well made and inexpensive running sock (if you buy them at the right price).
201022	the pattyboutik sexy off shoulder buttons long sleeve tunic jumper does indeed sit well off the shoulders, yet is held firmly and strategically in place at the top of the chest area.  well designed item for those who are also well designed.
201045	i am 5'-7&#34; hight and this vest look too long when i wear, even the size correct, might because i am an asian and this for a tall guys.
201065	i love these things and will never go with out but the one thing that i have to say is that they are already falling apart at the seams.  yes i under the material but after the first wash they were falling apart.  i can still wear them but i have already started to look for replacements.
201066	these are great for preventing chafing between the legs without the uncomfortable squeezing that happens when you wear a shaper.  my only complaint is that they create a line (like a panty line but at the thigh instead of across the rear) under some fabrics.  but as long as you are wearing a thicker/stiffer fabric or you are wearing a skirt that is the same length as these, they are ideal.
201372	for the price of these, i am shocked at how nice they look. sure, we know that they're cheap, but no one else does! we're saving for our wedding, and we can wait for good rings- these will do for a few years! ordered two more just in case these fall apart between now and our wedding.
201572	i normally take mediums but i wanted sweat pants that were loose and would wash and dry in machines. these fit just the way i wanted them to and although i have put them thru the washer and dry many times, i do not believe they have gotten any smaller.  i gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because pet hair seems to stick to them exceptionally well, the only drawback. overall, really like these pants.
201575	i'm 5 ft 2 in, 120 pounds, purchased a size small, and these fit perfect. if i liked tight, i'd go with a smaller size (xs) but i was looking for something between tight and baggy, and this hits the spot. very comfortable. hard to not just spend every waking moment in them.
201620	got my boots a week ago and did not take them off...even through my transatlantic voyage. they are well crafted, comfortable and the leather is good looking. wish nine west made them in red too.
201630	i love these boots. the cognac color is rich and the small heel is very comfortable to walk around in for long periods of time. the shape of the boot is pretty perfect, too - not so pointy that my toes are squished, but still a very modern shape. the shaft height is excellent. i typically wear a us women's 7.5 wide, but bought these in an 8 so that i could wear them with thicker socks, and they fit well. my one complaint is that there is no real padding or arch support, which would make them perfect.
201853	i bought this specifically to hide my belly which i am self concious of. i ordered medium and have to be honest it is a bit big on me. i ordered a total of 3 tops from allegra k and they seem to be different on how the sizes run. this blouse is big in a med. i ordered a 2 layer top (leoperd tank & lace over layer) in large and it fits perfect, and another that is listed as a dress that i ordered in med, it fits as expected. all this said, i will list my size info: i am 5'1&#34;, 127lbs, bust: 35.5&#34;, waist: 31&#34;, navel: 35.5&#34;, hips: 39.5&#34;.
201858	love it. i wish though that i would have ordered a size up, only so i could actually wear it like the girl in the picture. it is more form fitting on me and i have to wear leggings with it. really cute and stylish though, whichever way you decide to wear it!
201907	i love this dress it super soft and very comfortable!! always buy from them . get a larger size than expected though .
201943	i am very pleased w/this top; the design is generous and the top is well done. very trendy an fits great! also, looking like new after a couple of washes in the machine.
202038	i ordered these because they were different, thinking that i could wear them. but they are too bold a look for women in my opinion. ended up giving them to my brother, who also questioned their size. so i don't know. i liked the style, but just too big. would not buy again, unless the made the smaller in size
202043	way tooooooooo big and heavy. i,wanted to send back, but it would of cost 45.00$! this they don't tell you.
202085	these bobysuits are absolutely adorable. i bought them for my grandduaghter. the material is incredibly soft.the colors were beautiful against my daughters skin. i love carters caby products,, you guys are affordable and your materials are top quality.
202174	i teach in a gym that has branded classes that have specific colors....this has all the colors!  not crazy about the lap timing because i don't need it but still love the watch.
202181	fun color...easy to set and see and convenient to have when i am needing to be reminded of things with the timer.i can't attest to the lap timer and such but overall it's cute and functional for my needs. i love watches and considerthem part of my wardrobe and this fits the bill for that as well.
202195	holy hanna, this shirt is small. i wear a medium in women's clothing and a medium-large in juniors, and the medium in this shirt fits more like a small-extra small. i'm deciding now if i should send it back or just give it to my 13-year-old daughter. other than that it seems to be good quality.
202220	i normally wear a small, sometimes a medium, but the medium was skin tight on me. i don't personally mind, but i think it should be stated. it's also fairly long, which i think is nice. similarly, the sleeves are also pretty long.
202225	i love the feel and the look of these boots. i have skinny legs and am 5'8&#34; tall and they are just below my knee. they are very comfortable to wear right away. the only reason i dodnt give them 5 stars is because they were a little saggy at the bottom, around the ankle. i have a pair of tall black leather boots (another brand that i adore, but couldnt find them in brown) and they didnt begin to bag like that until after about the third year i had them and i wear them all the time. i just wish they had (and mantained) the shap pictured
202256	maybe it's just the shape of my head, but this makes me look super dorky. i will never wear it.
202275	i was in need of a new full-length mirror and came across this. it's perfect. my jewelry has always been scattered all over the place, and very disorganized. this solved both problems. it was extremely easy to put together and hang (all you need is a screwdriver to attach the hangers. there's plenty of room inside for necklaces, earrings, bracelets, watches, etc. the one thing that made me nervous was that when shutting the door the unit didnt always seem so stable because it's hung from the top with nothing securing it at the bottom. this was easily fixed with velcro. i just stuck velcro on the back of the unit towards the bottom, and on the door, so now it is attached very securely. it's also a really nice looking unit and doesnt look cheap at all. there are others on the market for much more money. i say save the money and get this one.
202288	fits a little looser due to the style but it is a great blouse for work, out and about, or dressed up for an evening.  i would recommend this brand over any other for great fit, great quality, and as always, they was perfectly.
202304	i ordered a belt too large for my waist.  it is pretty, but the elastic seems a little weak.  however, it does look great for the price.
202385	i love this backpack, but sadly returned it because the zipper is not located on the top of the pack, like normal, but much lower down.  that fact really inhibits the size of items that will fit.  sad, since it was so super cute.  just know if you get it that school folders won't fit - but it would still be great for a preschool bad if it doesn't have to fit a folder.
202400	i love these earrings perfect size and match with the other sterling jewelry i want to wear them with...great item!!
202447	i am so in love with this beeeeautiful tunic, i'm not going to risk trying to buy them from anyone else!!  i bought the cream, which has lovely gold embroidery.....i can't wait to buy a ton of this seller's clothing!  oh, and since a lot of the other reviewers said that this item runs small, i bought this one in 16 (i normally wear a medium, or size 10 in blouses).  thanks to all who helped me finally find what i've been looking for!!  yay!!
202455	"i almost returned this slip as the photo shows an ankle length slip and a just below knee length slip arrived (i am 5'8"".  so i ordered the 38"" slip and now have both lengths.note to younger women who didn't grow up wearing slips:  a slip not only keeps a skirt from being see-through, it prevents it from going between the legs while walking, so it's good for walking in a long skirt, also more modest."
202468	it is so very hard to find flats that don't hurt, rub or cut and these come close to being almost perfect.
202537	good every day type jacket and i just generally like the look and feel of iti'm 6'3&#34; and even i found the large very long, its great for me but unless you are very tall you may not need the tall size option.
202622	i always heard of how wonderful tevas are and many of my friends swear by them. so, in anticipation of a long trip to hot and humid country, i ordered a bunch of sandals and none of them fit me right. if you are like me, read my other teva reviews. i orderd hurricane, terra fi lite and zirra . terra fi lite was the almost winner, but there are few cons:not much arch support, the ankle strap is kind of low in the back , the ridges on the foot bed were pinching my delicate skin, little bit too short in the toes. by walking in them around the house, it didn't seem like there is enough padding to sustain the whole day of walking on cobblestones and uneven sidewalks.too much exposed velcro that would attract fibers, and dirt
202647	the moment i received it on the mail and opened it i knew it was way too small. it is not true to size. looking forward to returning it as soon as possible. do not waste your money on this one plus the material looks and feel very cheap.ok quick update i wont be returning this bra at all even though i didnt like it but my mom did. i showed the bra to my mother and she tried it on and she like it. she love the feel of it and so i am passing the bra to her.
202673	the thing i didn't like about these was the thin cushioning.  i was disappointed.  it was not as comfortable as other reviewers said they would be.  i was looking for something i could wear all day long, but these would definitely not work.  however, i agree with the other reviewers that these are more for skinny feet and narrow toes - they fit me perfectly because i have skinny, narrow feet.
202776	this trench coat is very well constructed. it looks like classic coat from 70s movies without looking a parody on them. it has zippered warmer layer. so you can use the coat in warmer and colder days.the material is of high quality, so the production. it may make you look older since it is not a contemporary style, but certainly it will attract attention.when you put this on, you feel very cozy.if you pay an original price of $395 it may feel expensive. but for $145 on sale it's truly a find!
202779	"i have never thought about buying a trench coat, period! i wanted to go ""against the grain"" and have been checking around. i went into department stores and tried other coats, including ones from hsm. of course, the price was too high for me which was from $300-500. last night, i was looking at the amazon.com webpage and saw this coat. the look, and especially the price also drew me in!  my black coat just came in this afternoon and i tried. wow! the quality, look, materials, stitching, finishing, and liner is just fantastic. for about $145 the price of this coat is just a ""steal"". highly recommend !!!"
202835	fits well.  launders well.  i am buying several more in this color.the blue is out of stock or i would buy a few more of these.henley's can look messy.  these fit perfecta...
202847	i bought these shoes for a vacation where i'll try to get by with one pair for walking, hiking, biking and lounging.i am comfortable in them right out of the box.i've been walking in them to make sure of the fit and no problems,i'll try to add to this after our return.
202873	these leggings fit great they are so nice and long. however the color is much lighter than the picture. i thought i was ordering dark brown leggings when i received them they're really more of an orange rust terra-cotta color. it's a pretty color but it's not what i was looking for in leggings. these are not particularly expensive so i decided not to return them but i have so far only really worn them as pajamas because the color doesn't go with anything i own.
202921	comfortable with the perfect support! i don't like racerback style sports bras so i ordered this and after wearing it once, i ordered 2 more. stays in place, supports well and doesn't hurt my back!
202984	this bra did come a little smaller than i was expecting but it fits fine.  i like the small straps accompanied by the sports bra fit.  some sports type bras have big wide straps that poke out under some clothing but these do not do that.
203015	i did not buy this jacket to work out in, i bought it to wear to work where i'm a nurse. i choose this over a scrub jacket because i already have a black jacket similar to this that i really like to wear. it is very comfortable and does not wrinkle if i shove it into my work bag or leave it in a chair for a while. it fits me better than most scrub jackets and looks very professional (so i have been told) because it is white. i use the pockets for alcohol swab storage or if i need to return a medication so that it doesn't get lost in my scrub pockets. the size does run small, my previous jacket was a small but larger than this. still fits though and others may like this who choose to workout in it or like a snigger fit.
203029	they look small but they stretch nicely and fit perfectly.  guys, don't be afraid to jump in, you won't regret it!
203073	jeans were the fit i expected and they are very comfortable.  the boot leg is not too wide and the colour is as expected.
203081	i hate the way these pants look. not only were they way too big, the flares on the pants me back to the 60s. way too much there. then there was he decoration on the back pockets, no thanks. it was way too much embellishment for my taste. i would not purchase these pants (and in fact, i returned them)
203087	when you buy online you can not appreciate the quality of what you buy, this pant is an example, put that regular price is high, it's on sale and now i get the quality i think of a pant of 7 dollars. i do not like, i think is a scam.
203108	i'm in love with this dress... it will be a regular outfit during the summer. cute and breezy. the belt is cute too!
203151	producto muy bueno,buena tela, corresponde a la imagen, colores vivos y bonitos...! ajustable al cuerpo, excelente calidad, lo recomiendo 100%...!
203164	i actually love this dress. it fits a little big but with a belt, it looks great. the reason i had to take off a star is that it's a little baggy on the top and my boobs were definitely popping out
203215	i always get nervous ordering clothes online.  it's hard to tell what they'll look like through pictures.i was not disappointed at all with this shirt. the quality was very surprising! nice weight to the cloth and the plaid was very attractively done in a warm color.  my husband will love this shirt!
203355	i have ordered this shirt in x-tra large, but it runs a lot bigger.  i have washed it twice so far.  it is still a little big.  i recommendordering a size lower.
203360	you can't really tell from the picture, but this bra is definitely unlined. i ordered it in 32ddd, nude. the details are cute, but i did not like the same it gave me. perhaps the better word is lack of shape. it didn't seem sturdy enough to be worth keeping, so i sent it back.
203402	i love all or any skechers shoes there the only sport shoes i purchase for walking running work in retail trader joes on concrete floors and there good on your feet and back for those long days in retail at work!!!!
203435	these shorts are very lightweight, but the material is strong.  very comfortable and will work great for the summer heat.
203475	for the most part, this bra fits as expected around waist but, cup size ran 1 size too big for me 40d and my mom 44dd.may want to consider your typical size or instead,  your typical waist size with &#34;1 cup size down&#34;.i will be returning for refund or credit this time but, may consider ordering with smaller cup size in future.hope this review helps.sincerely,michelle cleveland, ohio
203487	as a top-heavy woman, i've always gone with underwire bras for support and shape. but the wires do tend to come poking out (even if they don't break the coating) and i was getting sick of the &#34;bra bites&#34; along my ribcage and underarms. i've heard nothing but good things about the playtex 18-hour variety for years and years, so i went ahead and tried one out.it's reasonably comfortable. i had no shoulder fatigue, and i was blissfully bite-free. the support from a wire-free bra was remarkable and unexpected. but i won't be wearing the bra all that often, or perhaps at all, anymore because the lace was so damned itchy. lace does make for a prettier product but the itching was incredible. another thing i disliked was the lack of light lining, which i'm used to in my other bras: i'm certainly not looking for padding, but not everyone needs to know when i'm cold.
203532	ladies these are easily a pair of my highest rotating boots simply because of the rich beautiful color and style.  i purchased them in copper leather(more like a deep burnt orange or rust) in my normal 9west size and they fit as good as they look. i happened to have a bag to match and when i pair the 2 up i get serious compliments. the boots are easy to walk in and comfty. i usually keep them on all day. i have enough room for socks if i like. i consider my calves to be on the larger side because they are muscular (abt 15 1/2 circumference) and these babies zip right up. there is enough room for me to wear leggings with them but not reg jeans.  i wish they had the wine color in my size without a doubt i would have snatched them up. the leather is a good quality it is thick and sturdy but not rough looking. just a beautiful pair of boots!
203558	i've been trying to stretch it for a month with a shoe stretcher. i took it to a shoe repair shopbut they couldn't stretch it.  i have compared it to my other shoes and it is narrow and it doesn't seem like its real leather upper.  i don't know what to do with a cute pair of shoes that i can look at but can't wear.
203568	i love this purse, it is perfect in every way except it has a strong smell and i have it in my garage airing out.  i will be able to use it soon i hope.
203620	i just received the shoes today and am satisfied with it. it's pretty stylish, but not loud. i like it. i chose the natural leather so that it will be easier to match with clothes (previously torn between cognac and natural color). happy with my choice. the heel is a bit high for me. but i bought this for dressy occasions and heels would be nice then. the leather is soft that's why it does not hurt. although the insoles are lightly padded, it's tolerable. the heels on the other hand, although wedge, is narrow on the rear part and thus requires some effort when standing and walking. the ankle support is light also, probably because of the opening (a bit wide). i ordered an 8.5 and it fits perfectly with regular socks. the width is a true medium. as to it's durability, i am yet to find out.
203661	this watch caught my eye because of its unique appeal. it was fairly cheap. figured as long as it wasn't my everyday watch, it should hold up well for 3-4 good years...just something fun to wear when i go out. there are lots of cheap watches out there. they at least work when you first buy them. on mine, part of the blue lighting doesn't even work. there were no instructions to explain the various setting that i seem to be running through. setting the clock was a guessing game. the only two buttons, the two toggle buttons stick when pressed in....i'm just waiting for the moment when i push them in and they don't come come out easily- they stick.update: 5/20/13:the seller took the effort to continue resolving my issue. i appreciated the unexpected attention to resolve my problems with setting this watch. i received new more clear instructions on how to set the watch. as far as the quality, the buttons still stick and i don't know how long it will operate. i would happily have paid a little more if this watch was of a higher quality. but, as far as the instructions, the seller did make a good faith effort to resolve my problem and for that, i am appreciative. i hope to be able to wear it soon.
203761	this does not pinch and it leaves no marks. it is very comfortable and i'm very pleased. i forget i have it on.
203781	this belt has a beautiful color, but is much thinner than i expected. a great fashion belt, but not very functional if you intend to wear with pants.
203852	the photo of these shoes are accurate with respect to colour, style and heel height, but they are definitely man made suede, not leather as described. i live in australia, and would return them if i didn't have to pay for returns.there is no traction on the sole, so would be slippery on very smooth stone/polished surfaces.i don't think these shoes are going to last very long, and i certainly would not have paid full price for them.true to size for an average width foot.
203856	i also bought this top thinking it had zippers at the bottom, but when i got it, it really didn't matter to me since i found they sell the skirt as well.. i got a large and it seems to run on the smaller side, but is still a beautiful shirt! it's very comfortable to wear. the quality of the shirt is good, but the pattern seems to crack if you get the wrong size. if you have a big chest like me, you should definitely get the next size up from what you are thinking of getting so this doesn't happen to you.
203859	the shirt is very appealing, but don't go by the zippers on the bottom, the model must have a mini-skirt with zippers on it, is not part of the shirt, it's just a regular shirt. good thing, is made in the us so it's good quality and true to size. however, i think is not worth $40 as a simple shirt...
203896	did not like it as it was too short. like a shirt but not a dress. anyways. i donated it
203908	i wore this 2 times. about 15 hours toltal. the watch still runs. the bands fell off. so can not be worn anymore. can not carry it in your pocket either. the metal is twisted together so when the band falls off yu have little wires sticking out. do not get this wach
203915	i like watches, and this one was so interesting-looking and so inexpensive, that i decided to risk it and buy one for the low price. that was a mistake. some comments:1. the blue led display hidden in the band is terrifically clever, and in normal light, the bright led's are easily visible.  unfortunately, one of the led's in my watch does not work, making the watch worthless.2. the band is huge.  it is about an inch wide, suitable for a large man with massive wrists. the band also is much too long. perhaps a watchmaker could remove some links, although that might cost more than the watch does! i cannot see how to do that at home. no pamphlet or other instructions come with the watch.3. the aqy lava samurai black bracelet watch has a shiny, gun-metal finish. it is nice-looking, but it appears to be lacquered. not sure what this watch will look like when the lacquer begins to wear off. probably plain aluminum will begin to show through.4. unusual, and maybe significant, that the watch back contains no writing or characters.5. i will send the watch back and buy a different type. i suspect that all of these that appear identical are made in the same inexpensive manner and are not reliable.6. oh, well. it was an intriguing-looking watch, but at my age, i should have learned that you get what you pay for!
203925	this is a nice scarf, good material (not the kind that snags on everything) looks good with a dress or pants. came quickly. i recommend it.
204037	i wanted a large stylish bag to take on the plane.  this bag exceeded my expectations for the price.  the color is a &#34;fresh&#34; pumpkin orange with a slight sheen to it.  this bag feel like soft leather but doesn't feel or  look like &#34;pleather&#34; or  faux leather. inside the tote is a small very roomy shoulder bag that is large enough to hold keys, water bottle, business letter size envelopes etc.  it has 2 open inside pockets i use one for my cell phone and nano.  the other open pocket for purell, lipstick, lip balm and lotion.  it also has a zipper pocket.  the shoulder bag is fully lined and the straps are adjustable.  this shoulder bag has replaced my grab and go to the mall bag.  i have got a few compliments on the bag already.  also. inside the shoulder bag there is another wallet size zippered pouch with a wrist band handle.  the tote itself is not lined but has a &#34;brushed leathered&#34; look.  there are no inside pockets and the strap are not adjustable.  there is one zippered outside pocket on the tote.  the only con i wish the tote had &#34;feet&#34; on the bottom to keep the tote from touching the ground.  i would recommend this bag because it is well made and functionable.
204056	so, i adore bags like every other woman, but when i opened this up it was way too bright of a red and all the bright gold metaling and detailing work was too cheap looking for me. i prefer a bronze or burnished silver look on handbags and the structure of the purse looked thrown together. no thank you.
204080	"""faux leather""? yeah, right. this is a cheap plastic purse that i wouldn't have used if someone paid me. i can't be seen with this thing. returning it."
204100	returning it. plastic not as good quality as their other bags. if a little higher quality plastic it would be nice. style very nice.
204117	the purse was delivered on time and packaged in a nice bag.  the color is so soft and matches with so many outfits.  it looks expensive.
204133	this bag is so nice, it looks much more expensive than what i paid for it and it is the perfect bright yellow (not mustard) color.  i had ordered another bag after reading the reviews that said it was bright yellow and when it arrived it was a dark mustard color, the bag itself was very well made but just the wrong color.  i saw this one and decided to take another chance since ordering online can be difficult where color is concerned and i'm so glad i did.  this one is perfect, it's the color of a bright yellow rain coat, the quilting makes it look very expensive and the detailing is done very nicely.  it's large to hold everything without being too big.  i highly recommend this bag!!  love it.
204141	i'm a size 8 in columbia pants with them being typically a little roomy. i ordered a size 8 in the aruba pants and they were a bit tight in the hips and butt but seemed like the material would stretch and give after some wear. i really wanted these pants too work for me they are cute! but, these are more of a wide/straight leg pant and somewhat baggy in the knees. i prefer more of a modern, slim pant. also, the waist hits just below the belly button and i like my pants to sit a bit lower. i think these pants would be perfect for someone tall and slim (like the model in the photo).
204170	the black enamel is much different than i've ever had and they not only look nice but are very comfortable.  i use them in my third hole in my earlobe and have many compliments on them.
204184	this pair of earrings looks great and elegant, the 316l stainless gold ip huggie hoop.  they are so beautiful and elegant.
204215	it still nice though. i wish i order in white color for this shirt since i have so many black pieces
204229	i usually love clarks, have about 10 pairs. always comfortable and never have to break them in. except these...they kill my feet. the heel is too high and hurts and does fit correctly, flops when walking. the toe area is too tight. a size change will not help. i will send these back because breaking them in will not make them fit or be comfortable.
204253	these leather flats are perfect for long workdays on my feet.  they're soft leather, fit perfectly, and are even comfortable for afternoon walks.  i wear them with slacks and jeans, and feel they were a great purchase.
204334	i love red shoes and these shoes are no exception.  true to size fit and are comfortable.  he only thing i would change about the style is that the strap is a true buckle so you have to buckle and unbuckle, which takes time during the morning rush. these shoes can be worn with dress suits or jeans.
204348	these shoes are really tight, narrow, though i wear normal width shoes. the strap is too small. it is practically impossible to wear these show, unless you have really small delicate feet. the length is all right. i wear 7.5 mb and the length was ok, but so narrow, so small..
204366	the sandal is very pretty, but not comfortable with the little &#34;tongue&#34; that sits at the front.  i found the &#34;tongue&#34; so stiff that it poked at my toes and i was not willing to break them in, didn't love them that much.  thus, i returned them.
204450	i received my package today and there is nothing i hate on the product. the color is beautiful, the texture is smooth, and the size is well fitted to my expectation. this is where i will be buying my uni color shirts. good products and great deals.and the delivery is fast.i like the product very well.
204480	this turtleneck is very body conscious and thin.  the teal colored one is beautiful.  if you have a great-looking tummy, wear it on its' own, (but wear a flesh-toned bra under it).  i, for one, will be wearing it under a cardigan. it is very comfortable and will fit in nicely with my wardrobe. the price is hard to beat too.
204492	i bought this bracelet thinking it'd be more adjustable than it really is. i have small wrists and this bracelet doesn't fit.
204547	for the price it doesn't get any better. the bottoms are too small, but that is normal. (i ordered a large and have 39 in hips.) the top of the lg is perfect for my 36dd boobs. the color is more light teal.
204588	this was exactly what i had been looking for. fits nice in my wallet, and all my cards fit perfectly in them. makes cards much easier to find!
204607	the picture of these glasses makes it look awesome! they look the exact same inperson, too. the only complaint i have is that the little clear things that sit on your nose make the glasses stick out from your face. it may just be the shape of my nose that causes this to happen, but it is noticable when they sick out. other than that, i love these glasses. i think they are very cute, and the price is great!
204634	listen to other reviewers: this shoe runs small. i normally wear an 11 in asics (and all other shoes for that matter). i had to order a size up and my toes are still almost at the end. also, if your foot runs on the wider side of normal, get a bigger size. they were a bit stiff after i first put them on, but after about 30mins of wearing them, they started to feel better. the shoe looks great on. it reminds me of superman ice cream :) also, it's primarily mesh, so if you have to work around fluids (chemicals, health care, etc.) or in the weather, i'd give these a miss.
204717	love the jacket, i usually purchase xl but after reading many reviews of rothco brand clothing, people seem to recommend getting a size down which i did and am very happy to say it is a perfect fit.  the jacket is nice and warm and comfortable and has a slightly worn look which i like.here is the problem i find with it though.  it's a lint collector, i swear if i went under a black light i'd be glowing with spots.  it attracts every dust/fiber/hair particles. can someone recommend a solution for this problem?  if you have pets, you will probably not want this jacket.it would have received 5 stars but the lint kills it for me.as far as holding pistols in the pocket, this jacket is not like my sigtac jacket which has actual band holsters, this has nothing like that, just large pockets that are held on the side with a small piece of velcro. i think they should have went all the way down with the velcro but there might be a purpose to not doing it that way. i prefer the seal with velcro all the way down because if you are wearing this jacket not unzipped, someone might see your pistol in your pocket.  the 4 mag pockets hold my compact mag well, but you will not be able to carry an extended mag in these pockets.no problems carrying an h&k; usp45c and you can use a full size pistol as well. no printing.overall, i like this jacket and is perfect. i like this jacket more than my sigtac (well maybe not more), but it works for me because my sig jacket is leather and my car has leather seats and you know what leather on leather can do.
204721	i really liked these jeans.  stretchy and comfortable. the color is great and looks nice with brown or black tall boots. i gave 4 stars because there are a lot of stitching inside, and itches my leg. one of them gave me a little rash ( a big blue square tag by the pockets inside). other then that, they are great. i am 112lb, 5'6&#34; and size 26 fits perfect.
204792	a small should have worked for me but this wasn't comfortable. i was hoping for something i could wear and feel like i wasn't wearing anything at all. i bought about five of these to replace the barely there bras i've been wearing for years. the barely there bras are more cami-style so maybe it's just the cut on the bralette that was the problem. unfortunately, i returned all the bralettes.
204797	this is probably the most comfortable bra i've ever worn. it's also very cute compared to most non-underwire bras. but when i opened the package i wondered if i had bought a bra meant for a child by mistake! it looked so tiny, but it stretches a lot. i'm about a 36b and the medium fits me well. it is super comfy, it feels kind of like you aren't even wearing a bra. $10 is a steal for a name-brand bra. now the issues: it is so thin. if i wore this bra with a thin shirt my nipples would poke through as soon as i get cold. really the only thing this bra does is look cute, little to no support. it's not meant to be a sports bra, although it looks like one. i would not recommend this for anyone above a b or c cup. however, i really like this bra overall. i may order a few more of them before the price goes back up. i will just have to wear it with thicker shirts or wear a camisole with it.edit: i ordered two more of these, and got one bra and one tank top! i'm keeping the tank top since it's nice (basically a longer version of the bra) and i don't feel like going through the hassle of returning it. i'm just rather annoyed.
204874	i am giving it two stars because the width is misleading.  i don't know why the gel contend runs so narrow and all the other asics run true but you need to double the widith with these, hubby takes a wide width e in nike, a 2e in all asics and a 4e in the gel contend.  hope this helps.  if you get the width right, the shoes are every bit as good as the rest of the line and last the same amount of time just cost less.  go figure.
204880	i love these earrings!  i got tired of polishing my silver ones that i wear every day so i decided to get stainless steel ones.  these are perfect, light and so pretty.  great quality and shiny.
204905	i cannot understand how something so nice only cost a penny.  i was so sure something would be terribly wrong with them. not a dent, scratch, or imperfection can be detected by the naked eye.  i'm not complaining.  i am simply rather surprised.  will i order again? absolutely.
204938	this pair of short sleeve is a little large for me. however, it has good quality and it makes me feel good when i have it on. next time i will buy a comparatively smaller size.
204972	new balance is always the best for my wide sized family. sometimes i will try to save money and buy a different brand, but new balance is always my trues shoe. it fits fantastic and it doesn't fall apart. even after i wear out the bottom of the shoe from tons of walking, the threads always are strong and good! i hate to even throw away my old ones because they are still in good shape other than wear on the support.
204990	normally wear 8.5 in asics but could have gone with an 8 on this one. but like the colors and style.
205023	this was also purchased as a gift and was a genuine surprise.i was going to keep it for myself,but i am ring rich as of now.lol...
205048	bought it for my husband as a casual wear item. he loves it!! wants to have his initials engraved on the ring. beautiful workmanship. has the comfortable band which is always a plus!! amazon...i love your service.
205136	these are just as they the picture shows. i love em. they are perfect weight for chilly days and i love that you can text and keep your hands warm. i'm going to get more colors
205184	you wont be disappointed in this product it may cost more than others but after you try these you will understand why
205212	runs a little small i recommend to buy larger 2 sizes large than you wear or 11 size larger at least
205247	i loved this bag, even though i had to return it. it didn't match the color of my dress (a very different white/gold color). i knew it was gamble but went for it. if i went more places, i'd keep it, but i just don't attend many formal or evening functions. the sparkle is beautiful and classy. the size is perfect - plenty of room for a smart phone, beauty essentials and possibly even the thin, fold up flats. go for this gold!!
205260	matched all of the dresses that i wore to the four weddings i had to go to in 2012, so i definitely got my money's worth from it.
205286	please see update at end of review.given some of the negative reviews i saw on this product, i was expecting something low quality.  these stainless rings look great, feel good on the finger, and roll against each other easily when you put the ring on.before buying the rings, i had decided that i would cut off the rose colored ring and just wear the gold and silver look rings.  it was very hard to cut the ring off.  i finally managed with a rose nipper, but it was a real struggle.  i love the way the two rings look.  if you do this, it will make the ring slightly larger.  i had ordered a size 4 for a pinky ring, just a guess since ring finger is a 6, and it was a little bit snug.  after removing the third ring, it fits perfectly.all in all, good quality for the price, great look, and i don't see the seams some people are talking about.  these are very nicely made.  order with confidence.three months later -- the gold color has come off the other rings, so now it looks like three white gold rings.  that's ok, but if you expect them to stay yellow and rose gold looking, you'll be disappointed.
205291	purchased this to wear with any/all of the metal colors in other jewelry and am very happy with the comfort and quality of this ring.for the price i found it to be a great bargain!
205293	liked this ring to fill in for my wedding ring while recovering from an injury to my wedding ring finger as the bands themselves being rounded did not cut into my finger when participating in my sports activities!
205351	there shipping was good. the finish on ring i wasn't to pleased with. it doesn't even shine. it looks like fake jewelry already turned. if you have seen that happen. by write ups, i thought this would be a shinny new looking ring. not in my case. so for me......not pleased at all.
205461	i love this hat!  it says it's for a man, but it's great for mowing, yard work etc. for a woman.  fits great and i love the chin strap.  it was a little pricey for what i am using it for, but i wanted to protect my neck.
205466	this belt is really nice. i ended up returning it because the buckle is pretty bold...it looked like the buckle was pregnant. that's my only complaint.
205575	these look stunning on ear! they are rather small but very showy & attractive!great deal @ very low cost!
205584	my order came fast!  i was pleased to have this within a few days of ordering it.these earrings are cute...not too large, not too small.  not as sparkly as i was hoping for, but they appear to be well made.  i bought them to go with the shamballa bracelet with a similar center stone (from this same company).  they go great together as a gift!
205626	"the description clearly states it's ""fitted"", so i knew it was going to be snug.  a size large is perfectly fitted to my 5-11"", 180 lbs., 34"" waist.  if you like something a little looser but like this style, an xl is for you."
205653	used this belt in guatemala and had no problems. the only time i think i wore it around my waist was at a busy market but it was comfortable and well hidden. much better than the kind that go around your neck. didn't have any problems with the zippers or velcro straps.
205657	i carried this everyday for 13 days and i fitted 4 credit cards$200 in $20s and 2 passports. it wasn't uncomfortable andi'm petite. only thing is i do sweat a lot and one hot day mypassports were getting a little wet by the end of the day.to be honest i didn't have any incidents with pickpocketersbut especially in france there were warnings in all major sites.i recommended it for piece of mind.now i'm back on the states and i'm using it to carry myphone when i go running. i love it.
205684	i bought it for the cross and it is very nice, and it looks an expensive item, but you need to replace the chain for another (leather one for example), since this chaim looks like a dog's one.
205741	i love the asics brand. it is the only brand that i can wear right out of the box. i have a wide foot and the 2e fits me perfect. it has support in all the right places. love the shoe!!
205757	i measured my little guys foot with a ruler and his larger foot was exactly 6 1/2 inches, so i ordered a 7. it was about a size too large. if your child's foot measures 7 1/2 to 8 inches long on a ruler the size 7 should work for you.i also ordered the teva psyclone 3 (different color) in a 6 for my little guy and it fits perfect. (note: i would have ordered the psyclone 3 orange in a 6 as well per all the comments about them running large, but they were sold out, so i chanced the 7 hoping he'd grow into them by end of summer. he won't. the 7 is way too big and might be too small for next summer so i'm returning them. i'd exchange them for a 6 if they were in stock, but they aren't.
205775	i love these burp cloths!! so much so that i'm going to buy more, they're already in my cart. they are the perfect size to.
205830	this was so attractive that i am now going to order the other colors. i did not know what the metal would look like and i was uncertain about the stone quality. don't be afraid to order any of this type jewelry. necklace says it follows the legal guidelines of lead content.vintages golden veined frame oval red acrylic beads pendant necklace
205926	this is a beautiful ring! the rose gold setting really sets off the center stone! it is a lovely addition to my jewelry collection!
205927	is much lighter than my other gold jewelry, but then it is gold over silver.  the stones are not as i expected.  it is ok for occasional use, but i am not impressed by it.
205937	this ring was gorgeous when it arrived! the rose gold sets off the morganite beautifully, and the small diamonds were a beautiful accent. however, within a month of daily wearing, the rose gold has rubbed off and the stone has become cloudy and dingy. spend a little more money and get the actual rose gold, not sterling silver plated with rose gold. i'm very disappointed at how little actual wear i have been able to get from this ring.
205938	i love love love this ring... i was not going to order it bases on someone else's review that it would be good for a preteen.. i was thinking oh it must be really small or something.  i ordered it anyways (i don't mind small rings) and was surprised at how beautiful it is!  it's not small at all!  and i actually think it would look a little strange on a preteen (preteen being something like 10-12 years old)  it's a very grown up looking ring that is just amazing.  love it.
205962	i can say i've gone upwards of 30 years and never once did i encounter a new shoe &#34;technology&#34; that seemed new enough to write about. times changed after i, on a whim, ordered a set of sketichers go walk shoes. they were so comfortable to wear in the house and out, because they conform to the shape of your foot bottom, that you rock and your proper cadence and step without being forced into a gait by the stiffness of the sole. that bottom texture lets you feel the ground without it hurting your foot. your feet suddenly start to waken up and feel the ground like your hands feel objects. you can use your toes better to manage your grip as you go up and down stairs, to realize when you're losing traction sooner, and to feel more like your feet are your friend instead of a pain point.these shoes have all of the &#34;good&#34; that i got from the go walk line, in a modern but more traditional looking sneaker.my first pair of sketchers many years ago disappointed me totally because they made my feet hurt, felt flat and felt like cheap style shoes with no substance. i couldn't feel any more opposite than that about sketchers after my experience with the go lines of shoes. you won't be disappointed.
206032	i needed a good running/walking shoe. i am an asic's fan as far as comfort. my old shoes needed to be replaced and i wanted a newer design. i prefer bright colors for my workout shoes. these are so comfortable. i used them all over spain and italy and no feet pain. these are also my only brand for workout shoes!
206046	love the hat...perfect for beach! its a bit big for my head so need to find a way to keep it on my head!
206082	sadly, i don't possess that kind of body.  the shirt ran small, and the fabric is very thin, so the slightest bulge in skin (eg, around a bra strap or something) is revealed in all its glory.  it shrinks a little when washed, but then stretches back out to its original size after wearing a few hours.  note that it is &#34;cardigan&#34; in its design, but it is, in fact, a t-shirt.  a t-shirt with a cardigan neckline.  i mean, an actual cardigan neckline.  the model does not have the top buttons unbuttoned.  so, if you can get away with that kind of shirt, go for it and congratulations!  if you prefer not to have a neckline that plunging, don't get it.  it looks silly if worn over a tank top or camisole, and it looks silly if worn as an &#34;open cardigan&#34; over another shirt.  mind you, these things don't stop me from wearing it, it's very comfortable, but impractical for a lot of situations.
206092	it's a cute top, worn open because it runs small and i guess that's what makes it &#34;sexy&#34;, because it's tight and short.  i recommend getting a bigger size than what you normally would so that it's a little more comfortable.
206140	well the shoe is fairly ok. the quality of the straps could have been better (stability wise). i find it's a bit loose. neverthless the shipping was on time. good customer service
206160	i love wearing crocs around the house. i walk around the house a lot when cleaning, and with tile floors and they help ease my step. i ordered 2 pairs. i didn't have to shop around looking for my size because i always find what i want on amazon.
206165	i have other crocs that i like better. the plastic strap top does not stretch to fit the foot  making it uncomfortable.
206187	these are inexpensive, midcalf boots. i bought them for the color, because i have a lot of camo and olive green skinny pants and jeans.. i know it's hard to get the colors right online... but the color looks a lot more olive green than it really is. i will keep them because they are cute boots, but  i wish they were more olive green than brown.
206271	i wear a 7-1/2 but always purchase an 8 in gymshoes to have room for socks and possible padded insoles as well as desiring a lose fit. i have done this for over 15 years. this is the 1st pair that fit so snug that there was no room for a thick pair of socks. the  back of the outside shoe has a plastic design that rubbed my achiles. i had to wear a band aide to soften the pain. i purchased this pair for running outdoors however never was able. the glove fit is desireable for some and very comfortable if movement is absent. i also did not feel the shock absorbancy would prevent injury because the ground felt hard as it is, not cushioned with each step as with other running shoes of high quality.
206344	this bag is the perfect size, but it's not waterproof or airtight, and it gets dirty really fast. after using it for one trip, the inside is extremely dirty and it doesn't clean with water and a cloth. during my second trip, a bottle of mouthwash somehow opened up and leaked everywhere outside the bag right around the zipper. finally, it's difficult to get bottles in because the inside is somewhat unintentionally grippy. it's a lot easier just buying a box of quart-size plastic zip bags. double bag items and pack a few extra bags, and don't worry about cleaning.
206347	this was exactly the product i was looking for. it fits all of my toiletries and is a good enough quality
206356	i've used brooks for years --mostly beasts with great success. unfortunately recent restyling has cause the 15 d to go shorter and the toe box narrower. this caused me to try:glycerin 11  --these were the most spongy/squishy soled shoe. very soft sole makes for a pleasant walk. they won't be liked by those who want to feel the road --more like a lexus smooth.beast 12  --these share a lot in common with the glycerin. from what i could see the difference was denser rubber is placed on the inside of the stride and some on outside of forefoot to give them more stabilty. you definitely feel more road and they are stiffer than the glycerin (less flex) which is achieved by a rigid piece of nylon (which will eventually breakdown and provide more play in the sole).ravena -- these have a denser sole, less padding foam in sole, to me a fairly standard running shoe. brooks put a gel pad in the heel to absorb heel to toe hits and its fairly effective. i would say these are more of a runners shoe but far less technical than say a mizuno wave. in all likely probably will appeal to a broader audience. the mesh weave is open enough that if you press your toe to the top you can see your toe. these are very breathable and not winter time shoes with a serious thermal sock.ghost == very light running shoe serious running shoe. for running i would put the ghost slightly ahead of the ravena. definitely worth a try. if your a heavier bigger runner try the beast first.alas for me brooks no longer work. 15d to small, 16 d to big. ended up in asics. good luck, always look for free returns. you have to try them to see if they work with your foot.
206383	it really looks gothic--but it is very stylish--i like different things boots - bags - shoes - so this is the total  package- love love love this one also..thanks again..
206399	love the color of the bracelet.  received the earrings to match. shines bright and looks so nice on. enjoy wearing it. would recommend.
206403	i love this bag its nice its not big and its really not an exspensive bag its my everyday bag and i love it its casual and elegant at the same time, i love the colors i think its neutral and can be an asset to any style.
206404	i can't decide if i like this bag or not.  i don't love it, but i also don't hate it.  it doesn't look at all like leather, but then i don't think it is trying to look like leather.  there is nothing worse than a fake leather purse that looks fake and cheap.  but, i know that right now bags made of synthetic materials are stylish.  leather is, and will probably always be, in vogue.  but, a lot of designers are using a variety of materials to make bags/purses.  so, although i was disappointed that this bag doesn't look like leather, i'm giving it 5 stars because i don't think it is supposed to look like leather.  also, the description states that it is made of synthetic material.  but then, so are faux leather bags.i do like the vibrant colors.  i got the orange one.  i like the hardware...the chain and the way the the handle is attached.  i like that it fits easily over my shoulder and comes with a longer strap that can be attached if, for example, i'm traveling and want to wear it across my body.  i like the design.  each panel is a different color and a different pattern.  i like that it is versatile.  the black and orange make it nice for the fall, but the lighter tan and orange make it spring/summer appropriate. i think this is a 4-season bag.  it is also a good size, and my tablet easily fits inside.  i have gotten compliments.  and for this price, plus free shipping for amazon prime memberis, it's hard to complain.a note about the &#34;flower&#34; shown in the photo.  the purse came with a thin, cheap, animal print square scarf-type-thing, which i promptly put in the &#34;donate box.&#34;  but, it could be tied in the manner shown, or any way you'd like, around the handle.  i'm actually glad this was the case because when i purchased this, i was hoping that the flower would not be too difficult to remove.  turns out it's not really part of the purse.  this is actually stated in the item description.bottom line:  if you want a purse that looks like leather, do 't buy this.
206668	this was a christmas present for my wife and daughter-in-law. they were both thrilled to receive such a high quality shoulder bag .
206756	i can't see anywhere in the description that this shirt is fitted. i made the mistake of thinking it was semi-fitted because i thought it was the same shirt as a semi-fitted ua i have.the color is great, though the material is a bit thin. i'm not returning, because it fits okay, but i wish the description was more clear.
206768	lee pants usually fit me very well. this pair is a bit too tight in the waist, but is otherwise just fine. the material is soft and a nice balance between too heavy or too light. i usually wear a size 10. if you want these, buy a size larger than normal and be prepared for them to be a bit too large.
206781	i got these because i had a c-section and i could not bear using a button and zipper even after 3 months. they are a little hard to get over the hips because there is no zipper but once they are on they are very comfortable and stretchy. i went back to get other colors but they were out of stock. love them.
206797	just got these today. tried them on and they fit really well. true to size, a little room to move around in. i can't wait to wear them!
206828	pregnancy plus: these are the only shoes out of a collection of 67 pair that i can wear all day long without foot pain. plus the fact that there isn't a separate tongue means i can get into them easily, without having to bend over my enormous baby belly.  i really like that.normal fit:  for reference, my feet are wedge shaped, narrow at the heel but slightly wider at the toes, and a wee bit shorter than the average 8, but not enough to get a good fit with 7.5w. i just hope for slightly short size 8 shoes. i have a normal arch. i'm experiencing only slight swelling from the pregnancy so it won't affect my review.with this particular voltaic shoe i tried on the 7.5 and the 8 while shopping at tj maxx.the 7.5 pinched my toes and made my pinky toe feel a bit crushed. definitely too small so i bought the 8. i think folks with longer than average feet might consider trying on a half size up to be safe. the eight was a perfect fit in width but almost wanted to pop off my heel in thin socks.  in medium thickness socks, like most athletic socks, they're perfect.  in fluffy socks they're too snug (kind of a no-brainer there).the shoe itself feels nice and snug without pinching in any one area. there is no pinching on the pinky toe, no pressing on the big toe, and the heel doesn't rub in the right socks. the mesh makes my feet feel less sweaty than leather shoes which is really nice.  i like that they're so light weight, too. the arch support seems quite balanced and i've not had any problems with my plantar fasciitis.  in general i think these shoes give my feet and ankles really good support and i feel very solid in them. they are not comfortable on rougher terrain. while walking the dog i veered off into a rocky trail for a short while and rocks pressed painfully into the mesh and even seemed to press into the sole a bit, so i'd not recommend them for rougher surfaces (only mentioning it since the shoes claim to be cross trainers). on concrete and asphalt though they're a dream. no pain.durability:  as of this review, i've had these shoes about six months. so far the shoes have held up well, especially given that i wear them every day. the sole and arch haven't broken down at all.  now, i'm not running in them, just doing my daily walking and going about my day-to-day pregnant life.  given the extra weight i'm carrying i think they're holding up just fine.  i usually replace my cross trainers once a year because they break down.i'm going to buy two more pair of this design while they still make them, i like them that much.  that isn't to say they're for everyone, but they just happen to fit my foot mold in medium thick socks perfectly.i hope this has been helpful and not too wordy.
206862	love the compression, they make my waist look small, but small and thighs separate. they aren't as short as they looked, which is great. however, my stupid fiance thinks they're too short (lol), so i generally wear them underneath loose shorts...which happen to be shorter than these...hmmmmm
206876	great pants that fits perfectly. i thought they would be too small but they fit just right. stretchy material, does not move around when you are jumping etc. in class. fits at waist a little below the waist.
206904	i'm a very small person, and ordered a small, but it did not fit like in the photo at all. first, it did not come with the chain connector as in the photo, it has not button holes so there is no way to close the jacket and it is a very short jacket, it does not fit long as in the photo. although the sleeves are long. other than that, it is a good jack, very cute, good material.
206948	this is a very pretty shirt it was a little big for me but it still looks good. it will match with a lot of things too.
206971	what can i say?  these are amazing under a cute skirt with sweater and boots.  i received so many compliments so i always take tat as a good sign.  shipping wasn't that bad either.update:  it's now october 2013 and these are still a favorite of mine!  i tried another legging brand and no.  i will be looking for more of this brand.  definitely recommend!
206973	i wanted to achieve the loose fit like the picture so i bought the top a size bigger than normal and its perfect.  the top, green part, is a type of mesh so you can see bra straps thru it.....i wear a strapless bra with mine.  super cute, nice fabric, and natches the colors pictured perfectly.
207000	fit just right, looks really cute and unique. can honestly say i have not seen any shirt in stores that look like this one! i bought a large and i normally wear a large, so i'd say pretty true to size. however, if you are a rounded shape (in the stomach) it might not fit you as well! shipping took a month, but from where its shipping, that's to be expected. i really love this shirt and the collar is my favorite part.
207084	i wear shorts continually in the summer. these will serve me well, i hope. until i give them the wear test, i won't know their sturdiness.
207092	i bought these with a white linen shirt, perfect for casual sunday brunch or whatever! i had to return the original because i bought it a size smaller than i should have but that was my boneheaded mistake.
207100	the cross-body length chain-link strap alone makes this bag worth the price.  add to that the diamond quilt pattern and the fold-over flap and you've got yourself a very attractive bag and a great buy.  the interior is quite small, so this bag is only for those occasions when you need to carry just the basics - phone, keys, small wallet; maybe a thin compact and a lipstick.  i've already gotten my moneys worth from it along with several compliments :-)  thinking of ordering another in a different color.
207116	i purchased these pants hoping they would be a good alternative to tighter fitting capri pants for working out/walking. they are much thinner than i expected, but i still felt that the lightness of them would keep me from getting so overheated.they do, however, what i have noticed in the couple of weeks that i have had them, is that they are already piling up the middle. i also found yesterday, that after a long walking session, i had rub marks on the inside of my thigh from the fabric. this frustrated me a bit, as that is obviously quite uncomfortable and painful.they are, however, true to fit, though as stated by previous reviewers, they do sit a little low on the hips. i will be keeping these for lounge pants, since despite the piling/rubbing issues during more intense/lengthier workouts, they are still very comfortable. i just hope that they don't start tearing up the middle, as so many of my previous pants have done.
207168	"i bought this for some fun with my husband.  it fits like a shirt.  i am 150 lbs and 5'9"".  so i am not fat.  the model depicted in the photo must be like 5'3"" or shorter.  there is no way that this is coming past the top of my hips."
207196	the garter part is kind of strange to hook. i had a little bit of difficulty with it but it isn't much of a problem. it fits and my boyfriend loves it. the chain looks terribly cheap and is pointless but everything else looks good. i'm 32c and 104lb. 4'11&#34;.
207197	best thing i've ever purchased off amazon! bought this for my fiances birthday. i wear a size large and am a 38dd and this fit very well to be one size. the top actually has a nice bra hook and the bottoms are a very thick nice elastic stretch band. it looks as pictured, except the guarders i received were all red (not red and black as shown). plan to purchase more from this seller. :)
207256	looks so fancy on...you will fill like a model when you wear this..good for dress up and with jeans for casual wear...quality made just all the other patty women clothes i have bought and it comes so nicely wrapped when shipped.
207262	i love the way this sweater looked on the model but i was disappointed with it on me.  there was just an abundance of material and bouncy ruffles and it just looked silly.  i'm a big pattyboutik fan and i have many other shirts from her but this one didn't impress. :(
207334	i live in austin, tx and work at ut, so, my job is not very formal but it's also not very relaxed.  these boots look great with anything, from skinny jeans to regular pants, depending on how you wear them.  i like to wear them over my pants and the 7.5 fit me a bit big (i run anywhere from 7 to 7.5 in boots, and 6.5 in sandals.) if you have thicker calves like me, these are the boots for you, they're stylish and funky without being over the top and have enough room in them (calve area) to fit most women.  if you run really skinny in the calves you might find these having too much of a gap but i love them! such an amazing price, water resistant and fairly warm and very comfortable.
207361	i love these! finally, a pair of cute tall socks that don't cut into my legs! i bought these after reading another reviewer that said the ruffly part at the top will cover any thigh 'muffin top', and that's exactly right! they are comfortable to wear, great looking on, and don't fall down! perfection! i just wish they came in more fun colors and prints, i could have a whole collection of these!
207363	i usually always read the product review on what i buy from amazon. however, i didn't think it was necessary for socks! although the designs are cute i was disappointed to find that i only recieved 4 socks and not 4 pairs. after i recieved them i read the other reviews and realized that all this info was right there. had i known this i would not have paid $14 on 4 socks! granted, i could have read the reviews but i believe that this is an oversite on the description of the item. i shouldn't need to rely on the reviews to get an accurate description of the product.
207364	i didn't read the description well, so didn't realize i was receiving 2 pr of mismatched socks.  thought i was getting 4 pr of colorful socks.  doesn't matter.  i'm having fun wearing them.
207431	they look good and feel good. i think the grey blue colour is off the hook. overall, i would say the pants are good value for money.
207492	i love these hiking shoes, because the soles bend easily and are more plyable than most hiking shoes are, which helps you feel every stone you're stepping on.  really great in particular for hiking in the loose dirt in california in areas that are rain deprived.
207511	good shoes, very light weight.  fine fit.  bought at a discount so the price was appropriate.  i wouldn't pay more for them.
207523	i like this shoe very much, very comfortable, wide enough toe box and love the color.  i do prefer the version 1 of the wr/wt20 just a bit more, but it's getting hard to find and this one is almost as good.
207524	there was also a plastic strip across the widest part of my foot that pinched. this is not a comfortable shoe for my feet. i'll get mine at a retail store in the future/ it also appeared cheaply made--my opinion.
207529	buyer's remorse because i thought i could wear &#34;minimus&#34; on feet that crave maximus.  these shoes don't give my feet any arch support.  the &#34;tongues&#34; slip, slide and hurt the top of my feet if i tie them any tighter.  there's just not much to these shoes.  they look cheap to me.  they remind me of keds i wore as a child.  thank god i didn't pay more than i did for these.  for my feet, it's back to merrills.
207574	i have ordered and sent back more pairs of this type of shoe in the last 3 months than i ever have in my life. not only do these shoes fit comfortable from the get go, they are very lightweight which is one thing that i have been looking for in a shoe. i have other brands but the arch is just not right in them for my feet. new balance always seems to come through for me as i have a wide foot and need the width and the correct arch that they always seem to have available.despite the other reviews, the shoe does have enough support which is one thing i am picky about. this shoe is a keeper.i wore this shoe on 10/15/2013 on a 2 mile power walk with my dog yesterday. that evening, i found a huge blister on the heel of my right foot. this is not good as i can't even walk on it this morning and do not know how i am going to work today! i am an operating room rn so i have a lot of standing on my feet and walking a lot to do. i obviously cannot send it back at this point as i have worn them outside. this is not good news! wish i could return.
207581	these were just ok.  looked cheap to me.  i hated the neon laces.  i do not want my feet to stand out like that.  i should have known that from the picture, i guess i was thinking i'd like them more in person.  at least there were free returns!
207623	i ordered a wide in this shoe. i have small, wide feet. this was still a bit snug even with ordering the wide. i shouldn't have an issue breaking them in but next time i will order a dd. usually new balance runs true to size so i was a bit surprised.
207629	nice job.. this was a perfect gift for my girl. i am very happy with you with a excellent service. keep it that way!
207645	muy bonito el collar,  puesto se ve muy bonito y distinto, lo recomiendo porque vale la pena el precio. el env&iacute;o bastante r&aacute;pido y la empresa da la opci&oacute;n de ser tu paquete, eso es bueno.
207706	it arrived to my house a month before it was expected to ship, and it looks great, definitely got people curious and wanting a closer look at it, they said it was awesome. where else could you get product quality and service for so little coin? not a single thing wrong with this necklace.
207707	"i have to say that since the shipping is international that it is slow, so order early for gifts etc. but i have found their jewelry to be well made, and unique!  it's fun looking thru for that memorable piece you can't find just anywhere! so i would be surprised to see anyone else with the same piece.  the men's jewelry is cool and my spouse and i both wear them!!  i am 50 now, but young at heart!  some is classified as ""biker"" stuff.  but i disagree with that. while that group would find it pretty cool, so would anyone into animals or dragons, birds etc.  love their stuff and its reasonably priced!"
207756	nice product, quick and fast shipping, color is nice for the price and product is nice for the price my daughter loves the bracelet
207771	this ring is very pretty. i recieved it in a reasonable time. when i got it, it did not look cheap looking. it is light weight and very pretty. i have had it only about 2 week and i dont wear it often but when i do it is very stylish. the clasp to lock the bracelet works perfectly fine. very easy to get on and off. the only con i would have to say about this bracelet is that when you wear it the cross does not stay on the top of my wrist it falls to the bottom, but other than that i love the bracelet.update: i still dont wear this braclet very much, but when i took it out of my jewlrey box i noticed that it was already turning. i know it was cheap but i didnt expect it to turn so fast. theres only a little spot where it is turning but i know there will be more to come. very disappointed.
207775	i really like the different colors and the appearanceof the watches. a good buy,and a color for every outfit.
207791	this turtleneck was a good fit, very soft material, and a pretty color.  it came quickly and happy with it.
207792	as the name implies this sweater is a european fit, which seems to mean that it will run at least a size smaller than us sizes, and the fabric seems to also be thinner, but still a good quality. i will likely end up reselling it. the packaging for this was a little strange in that it arrived crumpled up in a plastic bag. if you are short and slender this style might be for you.updated 1/31/14- this is becoming my favorite cold weather sweater. the snug fit actually makes the sweater warmer, and the fabric is so soft- not itchy at all. perfect for layering.
207821	these slippers are built like a good quality italian shoe meets american work boots meets training shoes meets comfy pillows.the sole is a solid block of supple rubber. the leather upper has velcro straps on both sides to allow your feet comfort even when swollen. hard to find slippers for wide feet. but with orthofeet my 8 1/2 2e are the only slippers i can say i've ever enjoyed.
207833	i have big feet and heart problems, so occasionally finding a decent adjustable shoe or slipper is very, very difficult. these puppies are wonderfully comfortable, adjust easily, and are even suitable for tromping through the backyard with my dogs. true, they're not particularly feminine and high fashion, but if you're seeking comfort and durability, these are it! true also...i've never spent this much on my own slippers.worth every penny. i've been wearing them every day all day, except at church. might even wear them there.
207865	i love these shoes. they are cute, the perfect heel height, and good for dressy or casual occasions. i recommend them.
207899	cannot tell by photo, but this shoe is very narrow.i love the shoe and wish it fit.excellent quality, style.just too narrow for me
207915	they are pretty and comfortable. get them if you're into platform slipper thongs. i'll be getting another pair for my niece
207941	it is the perfect size for what i need to take for a brief stop at the gym (towel, mp3, earphones). it is nice and small yet has a lot of space. the main area is spacious and there are pockets.
207949	i use it as my first aid kit for camping, perfect. the pic shows a strap but i didn't it get but i am good.
207959	i am soon to have a night or two in a hospital and this is the ideal size for personal items.  it has it all...side pocket, lots of open room inside...shoulder strap and handle on the hand straps.  i did add a name tag but that was minor.  and the price was really right.  this is not a flimsy bag...good, tough material that could take a beating if need be.  i plan to get much more use out of it...all of it more fun than the hospital stay.
207971	this gym bag is perfect. its not too big like most are but has room and compartments for everything you need. it is good quality. i would buy again.
207974	my wife and i go swimming at a local ymca and these bags helps us carry what we need for our sessions
208033	i feel so freaking cute when i wear this hat. it's warm, totally cool, and soft and furry. i get compliments galore and it really livens up any outfit i'm wearing. bonus...when the gray hairs start to pop in, i just cover them up with this until i can hit the salon!!
208101	*very pleased to see that they have updated the pictures with very accurate ones. though i was not that happy with my purchase at first, it makes for a great around the house dress*it will not flatter you like in the picture unless you are quite small. mostly for people with very short torsos and smallish frame, almost like a child.something i want to point out, first, is that the sewing on this dress is very poor. nothing is finished off. they just pulled the needle up and cut the thread. so many things are coming undone, such as under the arm and ruffles are falling off the fabric its sewn to. luckily for me, i have a sewing machine and can easily fix this up. however, i know not everyone one has this ability.the top is tight, like the other reviews mentioned. i wear xs in most tops so i ordered xs. the top is fine as long as i wear nothing underneath, such as no under tank top or slip. this is unfortunate because the dress is a bit see through, therefore, i cannot wear a bra or else you will be able to see it slightly.the shape of the bottom of the top layer rounds, which would outline your butt nicely. however, even on me with a short torso, it comes up to short. so it does not flatter towards the bottom.looking at it on the hanger, it literally looks like it is for a child about 8-9 yrs old, which is expected for asian wear. however, i find this to be too small even for a teen/young adult asian. not in tightness, but in lenthening. i could almost say in design.also, if you are like me, with a short torso and long legs, you will not want to wear this as a dress as it barely makes it to my finger tips and we have to wear dresses that go past our fingertips.however, i am still happy with it as i wear it as a nightgown and around the house. the bow is absolutely adorable. i feel so comfortable in the dress. the fabric is very light and cool, which feels amazing when it is hot. really helps you keep cool. plus, my bf thinks i look adorable in it.so you may or may not want to wear it in public when you get it (prolly the latter), but if you want to feel cute, look cute, and feel comfortable around the house, i highly suggest this dress.(if my research serves me right, i believe the original dress is from the sammydress website. this seller prolly ordered in bulk because you can customize the measurements if you do so. so they prolly messed up the measurements when ordering these dresses. if not from sammydress, then most likely from a similar website.)
208102	the dress looks adorable in the picture, but the top is super tight and then it curtains out, like...in a supersized way.  i tried putting a belt on it but it just wasn't flattering.  i'm 5'2 and am 117 lbs and i got an xs...i can't imagine getting anything bigger than that.
208124	a well-fitting dress, but be sure to order a size or two up.  see the sizing chart.  can be worn as a plain day dress (use a camisole to cover deep neckline) or a festive evening garment, depending on accessories.  fabric is a little clingy, so you might want to use an anti-static spray on it.  color a nice, true navy.  runs short (is slightly above my knees, but i am 4'11&#34;) and would be fairly impossible to lengthen.  i'm happy with it.
208127	well, i can't say i didn't have my doubts about this dress when i ordered it. there are a bunch of mixed reviews for a lot of the allegra k products. i have bought from them before and not had any problems, but this one was probably the riskiest buy from them, in terms of amount of negative reviews.thankfully, my dress arrived within the time constraints and is super awesome. i had read on a lot of the reviews that it came in two pieces (a chest wrap and the dress itself), but mine came in one piece. it's not as revealing as i had though, but that's actually a plus, haha. it's perfect for work and i'm currently wearing it with a pair of warm leggings (since it's freezing here).love it and will probably be buying more!
208159	it was not as pictured as the material is very thin.  you would need to wear something underneath.  the belt is a waste and will be thrown away.  again there are issues with the size, but it fit my sister so i just going to pass it on.
208173	do not do not do not.. very very cheaply made like what you'd buy at a flea market for 3 dollars.
208244	i purchased these pants to have for my half marathons and my marathon training; i was tired of the other pants i was using.  i'm not going to lie, when i opened the package and saw them, i was shocked.  they were tiny! i thought i ordered the wrong size! oh well, i said and i put them on.  they fit like a glove.  just the way you'd expect them to fit.  i wouldn't trade them for anything.  i dont have to worry about them falling when i'm running, i don't feel the large amount of sweat that i felt with my other pants and they kept my muscles warm enough to run while i was running in 50 degree weather.
208277	these fit like a glove and stayed put. i didn't have to tug them up once which allowed me to focus on my workout instead. they stayed put during sumo squats even! i will be adding more of this style to my collection.
208278	these pants fit great, they're comfortable, and i love the zipper pocket on the back so that i can put my car or house key in there while running. they don't move at all on my run and they fit perfectly.
208299	i really think xoxo company for there good treatment with there costumers ... the watch was damaged but thy fixed the problem for me
208303	i have had many compliments on this watch and only paid $18.00.  you should try it.  loose on a 6 1/2&#34; wrist but can take out links.
208313	i'm about 5'6&#34; or 5'7&#34;, i wear a size 17 in the (inexpensive) angels jeans, i'm a 40 ddd, and i ordered this dress in a 2x. it fits great everywhere, comes down to my knees (if i sit, you can see them). it's very staticky, but i'll put it in the dryer with a laundry sheet and see what happens. the arms come down to my elbows, but they are split down the middle so it's like a sleeveless (except obviously not). the back is open about halfway down and then buttoned at the top, so you can see a regular bra strap going across. the belt only has two holes, but it ended up fitting me just fine (if i measure the smallest part of my waist, it's about 36 inches around). the dress is cinched there, too, with elastic. the belt can come off if you have one you like better.the pockets stick out a bit, but i think once i get rid of the static, they won't be so pronounced. love the layers. definitely get a great necklace to go with this.
208318	i love this it fits right around my other ring that i bought it for does its job . super cute
208369	it is muck more dull and darker in person. just okay. would look around for another before purchasing. just looks cheap
208374	hubby doesn't care much for lingerie, but he loves lacing me up in this corset for a romantic evening, cuddled up, watching movies and tracing the lacy trim.
208380	i ordered a 3xl due to the reviews i read and prior knowledge i have towards corsets and i'm glad i ordered this size because corsets come very snugged and like 3 sizes smaller than your actual size. i'm 5'9&#34; 38c very curvy and thick,  i weigh 215 even though i might look like 180 since i'm tall thick and athletic,  i wear size large or xlarge in tshirts and i'm a size 13-14 in jeans and this 3xl corset fit me perfectly!!! i recommend a 3xl if you have the same characteristics as me.
208431	the purse has enough space for my things + a cosmetic bag that gives me even more space!!now i have a bag to take out when i would like to be excused to the restroom :) rather than take my whole purse.i get compliments all the time, the ostrich skin is gorgeous.
208432	i am really impressed with this bag.  i thought it was going to be too big to carry every day since it was called a weekender getaway, but it is a great size.  the bag is really soft and the snaps make it easy to access the contents.okay, i am seriously in love with this bag.  the material is very soft, but has the look and feel of ostrich.  i got a compliment on the first day that i carried it.  this bag is very versitile.  i carry it like a tote, but if you want something more secure, you are able to use the snaps at the ends and have a smaller opening.  you can also use the hook and eye to secure the top as well.  i have not used the shoulder bag but it will be perfect for my upcoming trip or you could use as a make up bag.  this combo is absolutely worth the money.it has been 6 months and i still carry this bag daily.  i used it for a trip and was able to put my netbook in it as well.  thank goodness because i was stranded in detroit without any luggage.  this bag has held up amazing, there are no scratches, wear or tears.  i am so happy with this bag, i havent even looked for another one.
208451	i have very average-size hands.  i couldn't adjust it small enough to make it look anything like the picture.  it broke the very first time i wore it and unfortunately i didn't have the pieces to return. it was quite lovely.
208520	the watch was under $5us i haven't seen anyone else wearing one. can pick back round color from red, green, blue, yellow or it flashes all the colors in sequence when you hit the backlight button. i like it, i'm gonna get the white one too.... no instructions but had it set after about 2 minutes of playing with buttons.... maybe 5 minutes... lol
208566	ordered this scarf in the green.  the colors are lighter and brighter in person, pretty, but not exactly what i was looking for.  (fyi the lightest portion of the green scarf is an off-white/eggshell color.) the scarf did end up working for a different outfit than intended, so i kept it.  be aware that this scarf is very fragile.  after one day of wear it was shedding many threads from the fringe and was pulling apart at the some of the more openly weaved areas.  i have purchased other scarves from amazon at a lower cost that are higher quality.  would not purchase again.
208601	i bought these trunks as my oartner and i are off to south ametica at the end of the year and i wanted to look hot hot hot @ rio!they fit right and enhance my package!  i also love the colour.i recommend them
208605	too small... very bad construction. needs to be more flexible/stretchy. i have to reconstruct it with some velcro/hook and eye.
208634	perfect fit, perfect color, very comfortable, love these jeans. yes i would recommend this product.great customer service, product  came before time.
208642	i had to wear it as soon as i got it. it has my birthstone in it and it fits nice. its a little tiny but the design is good
208777	the gown is pretty on it own, but i added some rhinestones to the center of the flowers and a really pretty rhinestone brooch long ways on the top.  i have gotten several compliments on the dress.
208841	it was a bargain and i went for it.  it does look cheap and thus, you get what you pay for.  i may give this to my granddaughter for her to use as i am not likely to.
208857	i really wanted to love these shoes! the sole of the shoe is comfortable but that elastic back is tough on the back of the ankle. it's a very nice looking shoe and is comfortable to a little while with socks but i want a shoe i can wear longer. if it didn't have an elastic back, i would have given this shoe 5 stars.
208895	the color is exactly as it is shown.  the shoe was true to the 8.5 size i ordered.  i would buy from them again.
209132	this is such a beautiful dress. the only reason why i am giving it a 4 star is because the arms are so disproportional to the rest of the dress. i measured myself like i usually do when i order from allegra and for the most part i love most of their clothes but sometimes they are either too big or too small. the dress looks gorgeous on but i would have loved a little more room on the arms. i chose to keep it so that should tell you how much i like it snug arms and all :)
209159	these shoes look very nice, very light, provide arch support.but the cushion is very poor, and the outsole is too thin for a training shoe (imo).i was expecting to use these shoes at the gym, but they don't fit my expectation for this purpose.
209194	i am 5'7&#34;, 145 lbs, and i ordered the grey/yellow in medium (us size 8.)  shirt is relatively comfortable and this is the first from allegra k that i have purchased that isn't a size larger than what i would normally wear in a t-shirt.  my torso is not particularly long, but this shirt comes down to about the top of my thighs.  if you live in an area with a sexist school dress code, do not depend on this soft shirt to cover your bottom.  the yellow 'halter top'  only exists as the extended bottom of the shirt and the small v of your chest, including the strings to tie it back.  let me repeat; the strings are to tie, so do not freak out when you get it in the mail (small grey package) and the strings are flopping about, unattached to anything!  this is normal, i promise, though it is very hard to attempt to tie it in a favourable knot on your neck alone.  i suggest investing in a friend to do it for you.
209237	i recommend that some care is taken when using these on slick floors. i needed a little less stick-um when i zumba and oh-boy did these do the trick. be careful for sure
209242	after a couple short hikes:fits well, a little tight in the toes but i have a feeling after i put some more miles on them & get them good & wet, they'll fit a little better.  my last hi-techs (4yrs old) have several hundred miles of muddy hiking on them & just did the kalalau just fine, still waterproof.  i do wish the flagstaff came a little more narrow for the size 15.  i also bought it because i love flagstaff ;-)
209259	don't go by the size of these leggings, they run really small.  i bought the 3xl, because i am a size 22, and i don't think a person that wears a size 12 would even fit into these.
209271	my birth stones really looks amazing on me. these fit great and look great on me =-)one of the stones is loose already though =-( i had to put clear nail polish on it to keep it in place. not to happy i had to do that. we will see if it holds
209328	i wear rockport world tour classic's and have for years.best fitting shoe i have ever worn.i though i'd give another style a trythe drivesport is the skinniest medium i have ever purchased.i had to keep checking the inside to read the size, 11 m's and then look at the shoe scratching my head.i can't get my foot in the shoe.other than that its a well made shoe with top grain leather.but alas it must go back
209399	this is a great scarf. it is soft and large. the color is a little lighter than pictured, but it is still an excellent buy. it is very nice quality for the price.
209406	the purse arrived ahead of due date.  this satchel bag exceeded my expectations!  it is very cute and nice quality/price purse.  i love my hello kitty big purse.  i'm glad that i made this purchase and recommend to others.
209421	these are sized for tiny koreans, so follow the sizing instructions the vendor has placed on the product page.  if in doubt, go one size up.  this is true of all &#34;thelees&#34; products that i have purchased.  if you follow the guide and other reviews you should be okay size wise.  as for the material and construction, i've only wore them once for a wedding, but i found they were well made and comfortable.  i received a lot of compliments on my outfit from friends at the wedding as well.
209428	a little on the small size (large) but nice pair and we all love a nice pair to keep our hands toasty don't we?
209429	fit and color were perfect (small and red respectively), the leather had a few scratches when it arrived that my wife wasn't very happy about. the scratches/imperfections were very small though. it serves the purpose as a touch screen compatible elegant glove.
209516	i've wanted an initial necklace for a while, but i don't really like the look of the typical block letter necklaces, so i was very exicted when i saw these cursive initial necklaces. the script letters just look so much more delicate and feminine. the chain is beautiful, and less bulky in person than it appeared to me in the pictures online. my only complaint is i wish the charm were just a little bit heavier so that it would stay centered a little better. overall though i love this necklace. i've worn it almost every day since i got it!
209545	i wear a size 6/8 & ordered the medium, they fit great and are soooo super cozy.  the only complaint i have is that the drawstring does not have the means to stay outside the little holes on the waistband, so despite tying knots on the ends, the string has been sucked inside the waistband area a number of times & i've just given up on it.  after a wash, the fabric is holding up pretty well & the microfleece did not get fuzzy or rough.  i may be going back in for a 2nd pair of these for winter!
209554	these are very soft and fit very well.  my daughters really liked them. i would order this brand again in the future.
209577	i like the slippers. they are warm and cozy. they are slightly too small. i am a size 9 shoe and i am worried that i will wear them out easily with a hole in the toe. having said that, i still chose to keep them and not return them :)
209610	this was true to size.  a very comfortable sandals.  colour was exactly what was seen.  will buy more in this brand.
209624	i started searching for the perfect jeans again in 2010 after years of no jeans in my closet. i had experienced too many uncomfortable days with tight fitting, non-flexible jeans and told my friends i would never wear them again.  well,&#34;never say never&#34;! it is now 2013; i'm 66 and have found the best fitting jean for my shape and height ever! nydj sheri is my bff of jeans!  hooray!  for me, it was well worth the 3 year search and hundreds of dollars to find the perfect pair.
209662	these shoes were purchased for a 7yo boy, who has gone through several pairs of shoes so far this year.  he is rough on shoes.  i finally broke down and got keens as in the past those are the brand that last from toddler through adult that we have tried (we have 4 kids in our family so have tried lots of brands over the years).  the stitching stays tight, and they look good even after needing washing repeatedly.  this style is great for jeans, shorts and up to probably docker style pants for boys, very versatile.  the only comment i have is that the youth sizes do not have the velcro tab that is shown in the product photo; they are regular ties all the way to the top.  the younger toddler styles have the velcro tab and elastic bands that look like laces in the lower eyelets.  just an fyi if you are new to this keen style.keens in adult womens shoes run on the wide side.  the toddler and youth styles are average to slightly wide imho compared to other brands.  they are good for pudgy little toddler feet and youth before they narrow out significantly, or feet naturally wide.
209699	i have bought this shoe in sizes 6 - 12.  they are very durable and have lasted through both our kids.  in addition to this they are easy for your little one to take off and on.  plus, since they do not come in half sizes, they last much longer and i don't feel like i am always buying another pair of shoes.
209791	i ordered my size but on cold, rainy days i wish i ordered a size up to give my room for a jacket underneath.
209942	i tried mizuno shoes for the first time last year and the wave rider 15 quickly became my favorite running shoe.  occasionally i would feel some aches along the bottom or tops of my feet with other shoes on my long runs, but no issues with the mizuno shoes.  so it was a no-brainer to try the 16's.  i used them for a 7 mile run the first time out.  they are lightweight with moderate cushioning.  my feet are on the narrow side (high arch, neutral pronation) and the shoes fit me well.  i am normally an 8 in athletic shoes and wear a 9 in the wave riders.  the 16's seem to run slightly larger than the 15's, but it could be my imagination.  :-)
209998	i didnt realize the colors were neon they are still pretty tho very comfy as well i gave a 3 stars because the 1st time i wore them i got a scuff and it wont come out!!!!
210031	several years ago i decided to start running. friends and coworkers stressed the importance of good shoes, so i went to a fancy shoe store and did the whole fitting thing. they said i was an over-pronator and, based on my budget and foot shape, recommended mizuno wave inspire 6. they were awesome and i successfully became a runner! ever since, when my shoes wear out, i just order whatever wave inspire model is available on amazon. i have loved them all. i don't love this particular color, but what can you do.
210095	the overall idea is good, but for me it was too tight on the thighs so it didn't come up as far as it is supposed to and it wasn't tight enough on the belly to really hold everything in. so i ended up returning it.
210101	this is a very good coat. i bought it for my son who has now graduated to adult sizes. he is actually using the different layers independently during the fall season and finds the underlayer comfortable and easy to wear. the outer shell seems sturdy and waterpoof and should hold up well for the winter season. the entire product feels well-built and is nicely finished.
210111	i took these with me to europe in the summer and wore them almost every day. all way stretch, not too tight, and with a slight flare at the bottom. they stretch out a bit after a few hours of wear. they are lightweight, comfortable and stylish. easy to wash and hang dry, no wrinkles. they tend to pick up lint though, so pack a lint roller. love them!
210172	i bought the pink and the yellow.  i washed them first to shrink them. they are very nice for a long feminine tee shirt. could go over a bathing suit.  could wear to bed. buy two if you like the colors.  they are fun for summer.
210199	after looking at the picture, i expected the sleep shirt to be long.  however, i didn't expect it to feel a bit tight around the hips.  additionally, when wearing the shirt, the neck line feels fine when you're sitting up.  however, it doesn't have any give at all, so when you sleep, it has a tendency to become a bit constricting, and it feels like it's too small, even though there is plenty of room (over 2&#34;, in my case) in the neck while sitting up.  i like sleepwear that isn't as tight.  it's not bad enough that i'm sending it back, but it's not a favorite of mine, either.
210211	i like the length the best.  i am in a wheel chair for a couple of months (broken ankle) so have to wear night clothes during the day (i'm not suppose to get out of bed but i have no choice).  this covers me well enough to go to the door but is not so long as to interfer with getting on the toilet with one leg.  i'd like the material to be softer (like they used to make t-shirts before moving the industry to china) & it really needs a small pocket like they used to put on men's t-shirts so i can carry my cell phone with me easily.  but it is large enough (i'm a size 14) to be unrestricting (yes, i've washed it)  but not so large as to look like a tent.  (the model could have used a more flattering pose.  it doesn't look that bad.)
210248	i have other patty dresses, and i can't tell you enough great color, fabric, fit and wash-up!  this dress in black- so soft and so gorgeous with a pair of tall black boots! dressy or casual - you can't go wrong! 5'7 at 110 lbs, i got the medium.  love it! thanks patty- fast and beautifully packed - what a shipper!!! ***** five stars
210290	i was hesitant about the quality & look, but that changed as soon as i tried it on. the lace accents add a stylish look to the basic cotton black shirt. can be dressed up or down. sizing is true to size. quality is very good
210391	nice price, love the colors that you can get. large enough i do not have to have another little purse or tote to put some papers pictures ext that should go in a wallet .................................looks good,feels good. holds all i need
210470	i don't know how i lived without these?  they are comfortable and completely inconspicuous!  i own several styles of flats and these make them much more comfortable to wear.  my shoes don't rub my feet wrong and my toes stay warmer in the cold months.  these socks also work great with heels.
210536	i have some ryka's that are an 8.5 and some that are 9. it was a toss up on which ones to choose. i took the 8.5 and they are too small.
210537	again-more cheap shoes from china..but tehre is so little out there for aerobics/dance/zumba that is sturdy and light. not a fan of these-you can feel the floor so put in inserts.
210549	i ordered this belt to wear on the outside of my dress/sweater. it looks good from a distance but once you get up close, you can tell the buckle is made of plastic. but all in all, for what i gave for it, i'm very pleased.
210561	i really like this belt and am going to buy many more from this brand/seller. i would like to point out, though, that the band is white and not off white like the bow, but that does not bother me. also, the snaps show, you'd have to adjust the bow repeatedly while wearing to hide the snaps. i might end up painting my snaps white so they blend a little better. but i still am really pleased with this belt and still gave it 5 stars. one other thing, my waist is currently 27 inches and i didn't have a problem with the fit and it feels like it would fit a waist even a few inches bigger.
210591	everyone comments on how this dress is backless. so, i was expecting it to be a halter.in reality, there is a strip of black stretchy fabric that runs across the back of the dress, so it looks like you're wearing a gun holster from behind. and i love it. a really unique design that i've never seen before. i will post a picture to illustrate my point.
210635	the purse color is a little darker than in the picture but it's still very cute. i don't use the strap because i don't like straps on my purses and also because it is fitted very awkward. if you are wanting the purse without the strap i would say buy it because it's a very good purse and i love it. it has lots of room and areas to put your stuff in to keep your purse organized. i'm buying my best friend one in pink for her birthday because she loves mine so much :)
210658	my wife loves to were this gem around the house and im happy she dose !!!!!!!i will order more !!!
210666	it took much time to deliver but the product is what i thought. a little expensive comparing to the quality.
210689	these earrings are pretty-----the colors will go well with many things. the backs of them are black, but won't show when on.c.thomas
210717	i bought this for my wife but should've gotten me one also. it's is awesome. my wife loves unusual jewelry. and loves this bracelet. it appears to be well made and for the price you can't beat it.
210750	i am assuming that this shirt was meant for smaller chested women. i wear a large in regular women sizes and the buttons were bulging in the bust with this shirt and i ordered an extra large.
210834	i was looking at two different &#34;crown&#34; rings... this one and one that only had the crown design on the front.  i thought the &#34;all around&#34; design was a plus but it actually makes the ring a little bit uncomfortable.  that hasn't kept me from wearing it on weekends but it definitely is not a fulltime wearable product.
210880	i bike most days to work--only 7 or so miles each way, but enough to sweat [even in sub-zero temperatures].  i like the way the material wicks.  i also like that the waist is long to cover the rear when i ride.  the stitching is also quite impressive--excellent quality.
210883	thought this would help keep me warm. guess i misunderstood. under armour coldgear keeps you warm, heatgear wicks moisture away. these fit really well, im 6 foot and wear 7 - 9 jeans 34i bra so it streches enough for my chest but fits snug to my waist. will probably love them this spring and summer
210903	i love these sneakers&#8230;they were a little more on the orange side but i still like them  very comfortable and sized right
210912	i love this bra! the very first thing that stood out for me are the straps, they are extremely comfortable! if feels like your not even wearing straps. they stretch and the fabric is soft and durable. the fit around my breast is perfect. the only one thing i have negative to say is that sometimes the sides of the bra poked my underarms but all i need to do was adjust the bra. the bra also has great coverage of  the side fat under your arms, but its still very sexy. i love this product and recommend it to anyone.
210913	love love this bra. the style lets me wear a little lower cut but still have a sexy shape because of the lift.
210927	i bought these because i was in search of a lightweight minimal type shoe for hiking.  i have owned multiple pairs of the original minimus trail shoes and liked their fit so figured these would be similar.  my main issue with the minimus 80 is that while most of the shoe is very breathable the area behind the n symbol on the side of the shoe is hard and hurt my foot.  it is like a hard rubber material and your foot cannot move properly because of it.  the sole of the shoe is also very inflexible and i ended up returning them after a few minutes of wearing.
210933	i liked the shoe and the fit was as expected and true to size.  however, this is not a coral looking color as pictured.  it is more of a neon orange and bright purple shoe.  i expected it to be bright and bold, but not so neon.
210962	i really liked these sneakers but the cuff pushed against the outside of my ankle when i walked so i had to return them. loved the color, loved how they looked but i just couldn't see them being comfortable for working out. not for me.
210978	just a tight shoe that felt great first few minutes then began to hurt.  over all tightness, from toe down mid foot to heel.
211018	i bought this to surprise my hubby on our anniversary and it worked like a charm.it fits so well and i'm a 5'2our marriage was renewed because of this outfit.highly recommended
211019	"i bought this since the weather is cool out here in sunny california, low 40's at night, yikes!  like the other reviewers wrote, it is soft, doesn't feel cheap and stretches well.  i am 5'9"", 174 pounds, 40d chest and it feels like a dream when on, standing, sitting or laying. i bought the plus size since i am tall and nicely, it isn't baggy or anything, just stretches to fit.  i love it! it's a super good deal here on amazon too."
211051	i love these pants!! they fit me like a beautiful glove. they are great quality and shipped quicker then expected. their pretty shiny but not blinding; great for everyday occasions or for a night on the town. very breathable and comfortable. i'm going to order a back up pair. i just love them!
211052	i have been looking for months for leggings like this they are bunch up at the knees, to long, or way to expensive. these fit perfect and look amazing on. they hold there shape all night. the only thing because of the material you have these on while out dancing be prepared to sweat :) i am 5'1 115 pounds and the s it perfect
211059	read all the reviews and ordered a small, based on one reviewer whose measurements matched mine.  i can barely get the leggings over my ankle, so either these run small or the sizing isn't consistent. i'm 5'5-1/2 and 118 and a size 6.  will ask about trying a medium, but not sure about the exchange/return policy. sometimes it's not clear on amazon.  these were shipped from hong kong and took a longtime to arrive, plus i had to make an extra trip to the pst office to sign for the delivery.  not sure all that is worth it, given that similar leggings are sold in stores.
211109	these leggings are nice, they are true to size and i ordered a large thinking they would run small, butthey actually run a bit big. i should have ordered a medium. i am 5'8 and about 165 pounds and they area bit big. i do like the high waist and it does not slip down as you might expect. they are comfortable andlook great with my black leather boots and a longer top. i gave it 3 stars because they run big and i mayorder a medium at some point.
211247	love this hat!  i am a woman by the way.  don't feel like it looks like a man's hat at all.  fits great.  not so tight that it will totally flatten out my hair and i have a large head.  feels like it will be very warm also.  i also received it the day after i ordered!  can't beat that.
211251	the bill of this hat makes it kind of dorky. i thought i could wear it backward, but didn't really like the appearance. it is very comfortable, soft material.
211265	very good quality as expected and my husband says it is nice and warm.  if you are looking for a nice hat, this is it.
211285	i really like these scrubs.  look nice and professional.  fits very nice and love the material, it kinda shines.  don't know if they wash well, haven't washed them yet!
211296	i enjoy haveing a pair of these around for days when i walk and its to chilly for shorts... thanks,
211309	very soft and grandson loves the comfort of the waistband.  he is a hefty boy and these fit him very well.  we will likely order more.
211313	these boy's briefs are everything they were touted to be!after going through all the major national and store brands, i wondered how little boys could put up with such rough fabric that pills and rides-up.  so glad i tried these.  a little pricey, but i can dress him and send him off to play a happy mom.city threads are awesome - buy them.(they run a tiny bit big in my opinion, but maybe that's because all the other ones shrink.)
211339	"i get that individual tastes and experiences influence the review a product receives, but i have trouble understanding the positive reviews of this product.  this is the third amazon curated collection piece that i have experienced, and it is the third disappointment. the jewelry pieces come off as throw away pieces because attention has not been paid to design and the weight and selection of materials leaves much to be desired. for this particular product, i found a piece that was nearly identical to it at big lots for five bucks; it was also made in china.  i didn't buy it because, like this piece, it was simply not well made and not attractive.i took this piece to a recent family gathering to solicit opinions, because i thought i was being harsh in thinking it only deserved two stars.  here were some of the blurbs:-""the color makes it look cheap.""-""a pewter or rose pink would have been better for the outside of the pendant""-""the gold color looks like spray paint.""-""gaudy.  really gaudy.""-""the 80s.""-""the chain is really thin for the pendant (considering its weight).""-""why are there scratches on the pearl?""the necklace is packed in a cheap blue box.  there are stickers on each side. if you are giving this as a gift, be aware that when the stickers are removed, some of the coloring from the box is removed as well. so, if you want to check out the gift before giving it, the stickers will betray your curiosity/diligence.  inside the box is a little velvet pouch. it looks cheap but a little nicer than the box.like another amazon curated piece, i will be harvesting the chain from the necklace. it is a shorter chain and will look good with other pendants i own.i would skip this.  it isn't nice and your recipient might cry inside when she opens it to find a necklace with a pearl that has scratches on it with a gold paint job that looks a bit like a diy jewelry piece out of country living magazine.made in china."
211419	these gloves are soft and luxurious. they have pliable leather that will grow with you. lightweight and flexible, they can be balled up and stuffed in a pocket without drama. it seems the more you wear them, the softer they get, and they begin to get broken in to your hand.  that is, if you have smaller hands.  i ordered the xl (extra large) and find that these too have the same issue as many other gloves: they are not intended for people with big hands (particularly long fingers). they webbing (area where the digits/fingers of your hand meet the palm) is not long enough, so it's impossible to extend your fingers as wide as they would otherwise go (unless you risk ripping the gloves). those with big hands will know what i mean.fortunately, the fingertip seams work well and don't significantly obstruct function. i don't know that'd be able to pick up coins from a table -- they are not that precise -- but you will have better feeling in them than the vast majority of gloves on the market.these gloves are attractive and warm enough. the fur inside is a very soft chocolate brown synthetic short hair.  i wouldn't purchase these as &#34;winter gloves&#34; for doing outside chores or skiing. they are not made for warmth, they are made for style. they are a nice complement to a suit or even motorcycle jacket. there is one snap button at the wrist that closes them off from the elements for a better fit.so, the warmers are great, especially for the price, if you have average sized hands. if you have large hands (long fingers) you will be able to use them primarily for basic functions such as driving.pros:- inexpensive- soft, smooth, luxurious leather (chocolate brown leather fur lining)- dexterous and form fitting (good stitching and single snap button at wrist)- lightweight and best with business attirecons:- made for smallish hands (6'3&#34;, 200lbs guys with proportionate hands will want a little more length)- not designed for significant warmth
211475	clarks are very comfortable shoes and i have many styles. however this particular style sandal is lovely, if you plan on sitting all day. the sandal itself is very nice, a comfortable fit and well made as all clark products, but the cutout near the bunion is the issue. when you walk and your foot pushes forward the cutout hits the bone of the foot and creates a welt. perhaps if you have very slender feet it wouldn't be a problem but for me within 10 minutes of trying them on i had a red mark/welt that took a day to go away..............unfortunately i am sending them back........
211488	i usually have trouble with any shoe that is a slide because of the leather not being pliable enough to keep from rubbing my toes. this shoe is particularly good for anyone with a high arch who needs &#34;extra room&#34; in the height of the shoe.  this style is also quite attractive and makes a good choice for casual wear or work wear.
211528	as usual clarks are always comfortable and good for walking.  i always enjoy my sandals.  i would recommend it to anyone.
211531	own dozens of clarks--this is too narrow and material stiff/ not comfy.  i'm on my feet all day at work, and have invested a lot in the clark line $$$$.  love them, usually. maybe it's the color that made the leather too stiff and not comfy. or this style that isn't as wide as others.  but normally love clarks--these are not as comfy, the straps dig and don't give at all. not for someone on feet a lot. too bad. very nice looking, and other &#34;bendables&#34; worked just fine.
211543	very cute and fashionable.figure flattering, fitted at hip length, loose in bust and tummy area.recommend wearing with leggings as it is short.
211550	had high hopes that this underwear would do the trick - but still pantylines here - just in a slightly different place - actually a little less flattering than regular bikini panty lines, i think. so, sadly, these will not do the job.
211644	these shoes are as expected, quality is always good with clarks.  i am having a tiny bit of trouble with the sides feeling a bit snug, but i am expecting them to loosen up with wear.
211648	i love clarks!!! initially, i have always loved my clarks.  the only problem ever encountered was when the sole of the shoe separaed from the top.  at that time clarks usa replaced each pair with the shoe of my choice.  clarks usa coud not have been more fair or supportive of a faithful customer.
211650	got these at a nice discountfeel great and  this shoes has great support with minor liftwould buy again ..
211659	i wear a 10 and, by the reviews, i ordered a 10m. i would need a 11n for this shoe. i am returning sadly.
211666	for the last few years i have been incredibly unlucky finding a pair of sandals that i could wear all day; that is until i found these sandals.  they fit amazingly and best of all they have this padding that make it feel as though you are walking on a cloud.  i wish my shoes had this type of padding lol.
211695	my son loves these shoes and says they're super comfortable.  i was concerned about the color looking too pink in the photo (we ordered the black/red/charcoal), but the color is great - more of a fluorescent red.
211720	these ran very narrow.  i also didn't like the patent heel ~ doesn't look like it belongs on these shoes.
211795	i just received this shirt and it is a little too big for me. i know it has a loose fit but it hangs off of me. luckily for me, i like that style. other than that, i really enjoy this shirt. it is a good fabric and has not shrunk at all yet. i'm 5'10 and 135 pounds and ordered a medium. it is really adorable and good quality. i highly recommend it!
211870	"i am a size 8-10 l in pants. got a medium in these. super baggy and i have never worn a small in my life, at 5'9"". so i am returning and giving up. also, fabric is too old fashioned, slinky not fleecy or knit."
211874	love the design, i own several of the kinds of bracelets w the cross sideways, but this made my arm green just by washing my hands, so i only got to wear it once
211944	i love this flip flops. i payed $13.00 for them.right after i got them my zebra reef ones broke i used hard for over 4 years. this are so thick.i love them and so will you.
211968	i have been wearing this bra for almost every day since i got it. i like that the straps are set a bit wide. they don't slip off and don't hit my shoulders where almost all other bras do so that area is getting a break. the construction and under wire give great lift and support. nothing is poking or rubbing. five stars for comfort. the one negative is that the look under t-shirts isn't smooth. there are seems that show. if it had a smooth look under shirts it would be perfect.
211995	not my style
211996	i finally took the time to refit myself and found that i've gone up a cup size (ugh). at the recommendation of several people who said that curvy kate bras are a good fit for my shape, i figured i'd tray this one. i really really like it! i think it runs a teensy bit loose in the band, but not enough so that i'd want to go down to a 32. the cups fit perfectly. the lace and seams are visible under a tighter top, but i'm currently wearing a looser tshirt and the bra works quite nicely.i especially appreciate that the gore on this bra is quite narrow, as many bras are too wide between the cups to even lay flat against my sternum as they're supposed to.definitely worth keeping - i may even buy in other colors.
212045	my husband is a big guy. he wears his shorts under his gut and most all other shorts fall down due to a flat rear end.so these lee wyoming cargo shorts are perfect, they come with an adjustable belt that keeps them up.they fit just below his knee since he wears them under his gut. the triple stitching is awesome! i ended up buyingthree pairs, which we could not have done in the big guy store. thanks amazon!
212083	these shoes fit perfectly, thanks to velcro closings at the ankle and the large strap across the widest part of the foot.  the soft footbed is slightly contoured, too.  i ordered this style in pink, which as another eviewer described, is a taupe pink, the muted color of desert canyons, a shade that would flatter most skin tones.
212120	i wear this shirt to work. not really a going out shirt. the front is kind of weird because it's almost like a pocket made out of the shirt material. hard to explain
212122	it fit well, it's a pretty blouse, you can use it for every occasion . i recommend it, i like it.
212152	i'm always a little skeptical of one-size-fits-all things.  but i love this belt!  i bought this belt to dress up a shift dress and its great!  the belt is elastic around and clips with two snaps at the center bow.  the bow looks great, i've worn this belt twice now and it's held up great.  the bow is made out of mesh material and is very delicate and pretty.sizing:  i have a 25&#34; waist and the belt fits great.  i can see how if you were on the upper end of the size chart, this belt may not be very comfortable because the elastic is stiff and doesn't seem super stretchy.
212163	i am a 36c, 130 lbs, and this is wearable, but somewhat tight. it's hard to get on and off, and if i was any bigger, i wouldn't be able to. any woman with a fuller bust can tell you bandeau bras usually just suck. they squish your boobs into one big uniboob and then start sliding down and it's just no good. that being said, these aren't the worst, but i wouldn't get too excited. i needed something to desperately cover up the sheerness of a dress i need to wear, i'll make do for that. the ruching in the middle keeps the uniboob somewhat separate, but it still squishes them in an unflattering shape. the padding is just a very thin pad(anti-nip-on pad,) which is good, but they're not sewn into the bra, so they're just floating around. good and bad though- not everybody's are in the same place right?. once they're put in place, i haven't noticed them shifting around to much. so overall, i'm sure if you are an a or b cup, these would be fine, the quality isn't too bad, and i'd bet they'd be much more attractive looking.
212173	i bought this because it looked great on the computer screen.  reality was a bit different.  this is a matter of taste and this was not my taste.  i gave this away within two weeks of receiving it.  i found it unhandy to use and uncomfortable to carry.
212197	i bought this on a whim for my wife for christmas.  i was looking for a long black trench coat and this popped up.  i thought it looked nice and the reviews seemed mostly positive.  when my wife opened it for christmas it quickly became her favorite casual winter jacket.  it does run small and the lining does have some bulk so you can't wear anything really heavy under it if you have anything like shoulders, but it is really warm and my wife loves it.  living in the south, we don't get really cold weather so the negatives are not really negative for us.  the only other thing to add is that it does run short for a trench coat.  i don't think my wife is particularly tall and this doesn't really even hit her mid-thigh.  even with that, she loves it and i am glad that i went out on a limb and purchased it.
212200	the fit is very comfortable, so you forget you are wearing such a unique piece.  my only issue is that a button fell off after one wear and it does not look as cool without the two top buttons, but they sent me replacement buttons and a discount to fix the issue.  i love the customer service here and the free shipping and prices for the items can't be beat.
212217	fit perfect , come on time , is true the sizeexcelent price , great color , for sure come backfor more in the future
212306	gave this as a gift. worth the price tag. be prepared to wait at least 3-4 weeks for arrival. comes from china.
212521	i wear 10 1/2 size shoe, i had to go down to this size to go barefoot. weird how that happens
212550	unlike other headbands i'm purchsed, these stay completely intact.  the headbands are soft, stretchy and don't leave deep indentations on my baby's head.  the bow on the headband is not too big even for a newborn (about a three-finger width).
212581	these shoes are so comfortable that they have forever skewed my standards for how shoes are supposed to feel. i think i am permanently kissing heels goodbye. they are also really really cute - i have worn them very regularly for months, and they are still in good shape. great shoes. good quality. &#60;3 merrell.
212652	i ordered this shoe in blue and i loved the color and the way the shoe looked out of the box; however, when i put it on i thought it looked frumpy and made my feet look wide.  my feet are narrow and i can honestly say i've never put on a shoe that has made them look wide before!  so the style was not for me. the length of the shoe was true to size, however, i ordered a size n and over the toe it fit fine, but it was a bit wide over the mid-foot.  (size n or aa in most brands fit my foot well.  )
212701	this shoe was very comfortable from what i could tell but it was very big. i normally wear a 9 in merrell's so that's what i ordered. it was at least half a size too big maybe more. i might try to order this shoe again. i haven't decided.
212804	these sand les are like wearing sneakers.  very comfortable a good for long periods of walking but not hiking. love them
212811	i have at least 10-12 pairs of keen's including the mary jane's, slip on slides and sandals in various colors. i especially like the purple color of this shoe. i love the support, wide toe and foot bed of keen's.
212823	the sandal fits well, but the material for the upper part of the sandal appears to be inexpensive.  i was willing to pay what i consider a fairly high price for these sandals, but am not satisfied with the uppers, so am returning them!
212868	"the skirt is nicely made and attractive, but it's huge!  i'm 5""5 size 6-8 and there is a lot of room in this skirt, so much so that the extra material bunches around the waist and butt in away that isn't particularly flattering.  i'm trying to find a top that will flatter this skirt, but i'm considering returning it.  might be more flattering on larger sized women."
212896	so, this sneaker is not really goot for hiking. in fact, i think if you did anymore than a day hike in perfect weather, you might destroy it. it's not waterproof. admittedly, i should have read the description more thoroughly, it doesn't claim to be waterproof. but when i see &#34;keen&#34; and &#34;hiking&#34; together in a description, assumptions are made. i bought this for a week long camping trip but i won't be using it for that. no way it will hold up. it's a very nice sneaker, don't get me wrong. it's got great stability. very comfortable. not blingy. i'm keeping it to use for other activities that involve walking, which is why i'm giving it four stars. my first inclination was to send it back. but i tried it on and changed my mind.the outside is a nice soft leather and some mesh material, neither of which would really hold up to the elements. this shoe will be instantly dirty, and forget about what mud or water would do to it not to mention the fact it won't keep your foot dry. the mesh would catch on twigs etc and snag. so really all in all, not a goot outdoors hiking shoe, but a decent walking shoe/sneaker. they should call it a walking shoe.
212932	merrells are my go to brand of sandals and walking shoes. i have probably twenty pairs of merrell shoes and i have not been disappointed in them. i need a supportive sandal because of weak knees due to prior knee surgery. so i love that these sandals are very comfortable. the back straps adjust with velcro for a perfect fit. the front straps do not adjust but i find that they lay comfortably on my foot. i live in manhattan and walk miles everyday. other sandals often rub when my foot begins to sweat in hot summer weather, causing me blisters. however, these sandals are comfortable for hours of walking in hot weather and do not result in uncomfortable blisters or chafing. it is nice to wear sandals without covering my feet in bandaids from blistering!the sole of these sandals is molded to provide nice arch support and my foot fits snugly to the sole. i would go as far as saying that the sole hugs my foot. in addition, i find the design to be sporty enough to wear with workout clothes but also nice for your average casual summertime outfit. with most shoes i usually have one minor complaint about them but i really don't have anything negative to say about the merrell jacardia sandals. they hold up well even after being exposed to water, sweat, dirt etc and they are so comfortable to wear for hours of walking. i recommend them highly!
212978	you have to either be used to wearing the barefoot style shoe or take your time adjusting to them. i have always been a person to go barefoot or without shoes, so there was literally no break in period for me wearing these shoes. they feel great, like you have nothing on your feet. i can walk all day in them and not even know i have them on. yes, they are a bit pricey. but the other shoes from merrell that i own have lasted years and years. worth every dollar spent.
213019	i was very pleased with this dress upon arrival.  i ordered gold and the color was accurate to the picture.  the amount of heavy material and quality to this dress is amazing.  i expected less for the price, but this dress is every bit the quality you would receive in a high end rental.  my daughter recently moved into a 9/10 and usually fits a 9 slim best, so the top was a little loose, but with the wide shoulders and high neckline of the dress it didn't seem to matter as much.  i did not have time to get it altered and it fits suitably without looking bad, so i'd say it's very true to size or very slightly bigger.  upon reading other reviews, i saw that a petticoat was suggested which helped me out being a father who doesn't know these things.  i ordered that also and it certainly improved the look.  the picture doesn't show it well, but there is a very wide bow around the waistline (where the front flower is attached) which ties in the back.  this helped tighten the midsection down on someone more slender.  overall this was an amazing dress well worth every penny.
213090	shoes with good stitching, bright colors and fresh inside. very comfortable and lightweight. i have previously used this brand, are durable.
213092	comfortable, light with good support. i just hope they prove to be durable and longlasting. the reebok name have proven to be dependable, in the past i have never hada problem with reebok.
213099	these seemed a little strange when i first started using them, bu i have to admit the design amkes them the most compfortable shoes i own.
213143	if yo have wide feet go up a size or get the wide. got this for gift for grand, and she love them, she said they felts so good she wanted to wear them to gym, she has no arches, her mom does and tried them on she said not for her.
213240	i was confused by this shoe's description being focused on biking. apparently there are urban professional gals cycling to work in pencil skirts and heels? well, these shoes would be comfortable enough for biking-- they even feature a tiny reflector strip on the heel, along with a textured sole for pedal grip-tion. however, i bought these to wear for a professional convention in vegas (lots of walking). the footbed is supportive and comfortable. the heel gives just enough height to wear with dresses, skirts, or leggings and tunics. i like that they are not super bare-- this is a substantial and flattering shoe. the heel counter is soft (no blisters). no break-in required. fit is true to size. i mostly wear 7-- sometimes 7.5 in close-toe dress heels and boots. the 7.5, which i purchased first, seemed ok in length but the top piecing/straps were too loose. the 7 was a much better fit for me.  if you're looking for a hot peep-toe that you can walk and dance in, these are great. my husband said they are sexy, too.
213313	i am so happy with this trail running shoe!  i wear a 7.5 and ordered the 7.5 - it fits perfectly with some room in the toe area which i need.  they are so comfortable and at the same time give me the support in the arch area.  i was able to use them the same day i received them and had no problem after wearing them for 3 hours.  the shoe is light weight, flexible, and i love the colors!  i highly recommend these trail running shoes!
213344	i purchased this shoe because i wanted a causual but cute sneaker, and this was it.  i will be returning the shoe though, only because it think it looks too juvenile.  the shoe would be fun for a high school or college student.  very comfortable, easy to walk in and has lots of sparkle as the name indicates.  cute, but i am a little too mature for this style.
213364	these watches get way more compliments then i ever imagined. they are big and cute, and they hold up to a long night at work. i also love the rubber band, because it stays in place on my arm.
213403	i bought this handbag for the color.  it's very stylish and compliments my outfit.  it's very roomy inside -- holds everything you need
213405	beautiful and unique plus affordable on any budget :-)  you can have the look of the stars with out paying through the stars :-)
213460	"an absolute wonderful piece. i have been receiving soooo many compliments on this ring. everyone asking where i bought it from. amazon is the place to buy. 1000jewels has the best cz's i have ever seen. russian ice on fire ""wow"" perfection !!!!"
213472	these shoes are comfortable and it goes with everything! it also brings in some compliments. i think i'd like to get the style in other colors also.
213476	i got lots of compliments on these beautiful shoes. they are really unusual. they run narrow, however, and so after a day of office work, i was ready to go back to wearing my flip flops.
213485	i am wearing this necklace for the first time today, and am getting compliments like crazy. will definately get alot of use out of it!
213495	and comfortable shoes that fit well to walk due to their flexibility.i love them.fit very well to every movement while walking. i feel discomfort in the feet.
213501	love my dr scholl's they are so comfortable...i can wear them with just about anything...have them in brown and black..considering ordering another pair..i get many inquiries!!
213547	so i was reading the reviews before i ordered this and people kept saying to order a size bigger but i'm wearing the small and it's not small enough. i this either people have a distorted body image or i'm just extra small. my hands are very small despite me being a woman. so be realistic with yourself and if you have small hands order the small because the size runs  correctly. small is the smallest size and although the gloves don't fit as snugly as i'd like them to, they aren't sliding off my hands, but i suppose i could just try to gain weight. that said, i certainly don't regret this purchase.the gloves shipped out rather late and i had to send an email asking why it was taking so long. when i did however, i immediately received an email saying they had been shipped out so it only gets 4 stars because of the time it took to ship out which was the longest it's ever been considering how many things i've ordered off amazon.
213569	these gloves are super soft and stylish, but they're also completely functional. they even make great winter driving gloves! (my normal knit gloves slid on the steering wheel too much.) i took the advice of others and, despite being an average-sized female, bought the extra large size. they fit perfectly.
213623	i have many pairs of clarks. i keep the clarks shoes that fit. i wear a size 7 narrow.these sandals are large enough to be dangerous to walk in! i could wear heavy socks to make them fit, but these are warm weather sandals, and i never wear heavy socks in any of my clarks shoes.these sandals are being returned.
213705	it is poorly finished.  my pair required a lot of touching up with black shoe polish, or you could also use indelible marker.  it is worth the effort, they are comfortable and look good.
213725	reeboks, or certain styles of them just fit my feet perfectly. these have mesh vents in the forward half top keep your feet cool in warm weather. perfect color to match my wardrobe is a bonus too!
213766	i needed a pair of shoes for wearing in the water.  the size is perfect and true to size.  very happy with the shoe.
213801	my foot is wide and the shoe was too clunky on my foot, but overall it would look better on someone with a smaller foot.
213839	this item replaced a very inexpensive bomber that was at least two quality grades below this one (which i got on sale).  the difference is amazing. this jacket has perfect fit, comfort, warmth and looks. caveat: i have been warned that only those of us who watch our waistlines should wear it.
213853	this shoe felt like it weight 15 lbs on each foot i would have been tired after wearing them all day .
213855	i was just diagnosed with plantar fasciitis and was on the lookout for shoes that provide support and comfort without being clod-hoppers that did not scream &#34;i have foot problems!!&#34; until i received my orthotic inserts.i just love these shoes and cannot say enough good things about them.  they fit well, and were not difficult to get used to the sudden arch support (i normally wear flat sandals and slide ons).  it is amazing what a difference a pair of shoes can make!  the best thing is they are really cute mary jane style, so i get function and fashion (and many compliments from co-workers).
213864	i ordered these a few sizes too big because they were on sale for $14. great shoes for the price! my 2 year old took them out of the box and tried to wear them around the house even though they are several sizes too big. i guess they get the stamp of approval from her!
213870	this watch is so cool just like the others if i knew how great it was going to look i would have ordered 20 more.
213874	i love it haven't worn it yet but i'll get 2 it soon thnx givioniasmith!! thnx fanmily 4 allowwing me 2 buy something 4 wa!!
213924	i recently went to a local shoe store and was shocked both by the high prices and the eye-searing colors for girl's shoes.  i immediately searched for shoes on amazon and was surprised to find girl's saucony shoes for such a reasonable price.  i had always associated the brand with higher end (and narrow) running shoes.  fortunately they were listed as free returns so i thought i'd take a chance and i'm glad i did.the build quality seems good and a couple of weeks in of being worn everyday and they are holding up well.  they were not too narrow as i'd feared and they passed the school dress code so everyone is a winner.  recommended.
213926	well made, comfortable and attractive shoe.  from my experience with saucony, i have found that they run a little small so i ordered a half size larger and a &#34;wide&#34; which isn't actually wide.  they fit my granddaughter perfectly. these are her favorite athletic shoes and i hope to find them in another color.
213942	i am so disappointed, they are actually causing my plantar fasciatous to flare up. :(  if you don't need any arch support, these are your shoes, they are also a wee bit wobbly, notice that the heel curves in a bit, i have a friend with stability issues and the mushiness and curved heel made them unwearable for her. keep in mind people love these, i like them, i might stick an arch support in them and see if that makes the difference. otherwise, they are very cute, very soft, but no support. not like reefs or fitflop, those i have and they offer more support.
214070	these are by far the best flip flops i have ever owned.  i'm on my second pair.  they have been comfortable from the moment i put them on.  i love them -- i wear them so much, i wear them out.  i'm going to order another pair in the spring (or maybe 2 pair!!).  they are the best!!
214425	i have lost two gold rings prior to buying this one.  i don't think i will go back.  this looks and feels very nice.
214496	i absolutely love this shoe and crocs in general. i have all four colours and will by more if i see any different
214584	i have a love affair with crocs. with problem feet (hereditary bunions and wide feet in general), crocs are heaven sent (podiatrist agrees).  so of course i expected to love this, but it truth, it's more that that - i adore these!  the fit is true to crocs sizing.  i wear a 7.5 in most shoes, but size down in crocs to a 7.  they are perfect for summer and i feel like i am walking on air.  i got the bronze/espresso color and i know it will match most of my outfits as it looks so neutral.  the material is their smoother translucent crocslite which i prefer, but because of the translucency be aware it's more of a gray than a black (i guess that's the espresso color) and more of a taupe than bronze.  i already own other pairs of shoes in this material, so i knew what to expect.btw, the picture on the site for the bronze/espresso is incorrect.  it is showing the black instead.  just do a search for the correct picture.  the correct color will be sent.
214615	my husband needed a ring holder for his skull rings and this one is perfect. i love that the arms are at different levels. very cool for rings.
214628	the first thing i noticed about the dbh: travel passport wallet organizer is the generous amount of space and organization provided and how light in weight the wallet is.  in the wallet you will find: 4 dedicated slots on the left and right for credit, business, or frequent traveler cards; on the bottom right there is a see through pocket great for identification; whilst the bottom left has a deeper pocket, and a zip pocket great for holding a spare key or change.  both the left and right have long, deep pockets at the top designed for holding airline tickets or your folded up itinerary.  the left has an enclosed inner pocket great for holding money and the right has a folder pocket.  down the inner spine, you will find a holder for a pen or pencil.  the pocket on the front outside of the wallet is great for accessing documents quickly like a boarding pass, immigration/customs form.the travel passport wallet organizer is quite durable, and well constructed. with normal use, it should last a good long time. there's lots of roomand its sleek lines and cover design make it stylish and chic.having the travel passport wallet organizer will help your travel by keeping things well organized, yet small enough to carry with you or lock away in a hotel safe.  overall, i really like it!disclosure: i received this product from the vendor for the purposes of providing this review. a review in exchange for the review sample was not promised. the views and opinions expressed in this review are my own, and in no way represent the views or opinions of the manufacturer or vendor.
214668	i had high hopes for these but they didn't pan out. no hard feelings though, hugo boss is still one of my favorite brands. they make excellent polo shirts, slacks and suits.it's been years since i bought new briefs; i have been wearing boxers for decades and only wear briefs with dress slacks and low rise jeans. i now have a job that has me wearing slacks four days a week so i had to get a few more pair to add to the rotation.there didn't seem to be anything wrong with the design, i just didn't like the fit. it is possible i should have ordered the small but after reading all the reviews i was worried they would be too small. it's highly likely i would have kept them if i had ordered the small but the cut was suspect enough that i didn't want to chance it. i prefer a little more coverage in the back and a little bit of a lower rise.just to give you a reference, i'm 6' and weigh in at about 150 lbs with a 31&#34; waist. normally when something says low-rise it fits me like a mid-rise.
214705	"i purchased these at the clark's store with the intention of having a comfortable heel, and upon first try they seemed just fine. i got a size 7.5 m which is my normal size.i started to fall out of them as i walked, and called clark's to return them. upon receiving a size 7, i was excited to finally wear these in comfort.within a few yards i started to feel a lot of discomfort, both in the ball of my foot, the heel, and on the sides. i figured i needed to ""break these in"" and gave them 2 more days, and it was horribly painful. i went in to get sized, and they were correctly sized- they just did not work for me. i have worn all sorts of shoes, from crazy 8 inch heels to marathon running shoes, and this was the worst pain a shoe on it's own has given my foot.fortunately, clark's is a great company and is accepting my return for a full refund. that gives these an extra star in my book- at least if they don't work, you can return them.i write this so others may know a) they run a bit large and b) clark's are not comfortable for everyone, so don't feel bad if they don't work for you, because clark's will take them back if reasonable!"
214719	i've recently had to donate two pairs of wedge heels that looked great but didn't fit properly - even with the addition of gel pads at the ball of the foot and heel, the shoes were too loose and generally didn't fit well, although they both seemed fine when i tried them on and my feet are typically quite true-to-size (8.5).  clarks version of the simple wedge pump is perfect in every way - great style, extremely comfortable and looks great with skinny jeans or dresses/ skirts.  i'll be getting a pair in tan soon - love these shoes!
214724	i read the reviews here,and was unsure of what size to get - i usually wear 8 in flat shoes,7.5 in heels,and have to accomodate my bunions.  was worried about the rounded toe and whether my toes would be squeezed. i opted for the 7.5 beige snake.  when i came home from work today, my shoes were waiting.  i put them on,and was shocked when my feet slipped right in, without any hosiery, even after working all day!! and the shoes felt like a second skin!!  my toes weren't shoved up into the toe box,and i felt like i was walking on air - no hard heel strike, even though a wooden heel.  they looked great with my skinny jeans too, since i decided to wear them out for dinner!!  i think these will be my new favorite shoes.  i might order some other colors as well!! well worth the price, except for...the description, which states leather - they feel like leather, but inside states man-made upper.  had i known this was plastic, i definitely would not have ordered.  even now, because the shoe looks so good, i'm not sure that it wasn't labeled incorrectly in the shoe. i do hope the snake-skin won't crack and peel like a synthetic, but hopefully i can return if they do, with the claim of false advertising.  amazon needs to proof those descriptions before publishing...
214728	love these shoes - not only are they totally comfortable, they are really nicely made and look fabulous with work and dressy outfits. i hope they last years. nice round toe wedge option, very walkable.
214775	the cobalt blue with the turtle shell looking front are what sold me on this shoe. i've go so many flats that are one color and this will brighten up the wardrobe.
214790	they are really beautiful and not great on your feet. they &#34;pucker&#34; on the sides, rub your feet around the instep and are not made for walking, but, they have total strangers telling me they love my shoes. i must be very shallow, so i keep the shoes and wear them.
214878	i love this ring! i have purchased several things off of amazon, from vitamins to necklaces, even other rings, but this is my favorite thing i have ever bought! it is beautiful, the setting is nice and solid, & the stone is so colorful, i will definatly be wearing this ring a lot! i wear a size 5 and the ring is about the width of my finger, but all i can say is don't hesitate on this ring, you won't regret buying it, i know sometimes you worry about buying a ring you haven't seen in person, but trust me, this will thrill you at how beautiful it is. and as an extra bonus, it comes in an adorable little silver box with a bow :) it made my day to get it, & i can't wait to show it off to my friends!
214987	i always had drouble finding good and comfortable sandals/shoes but since i've bought the brand clark i can work with them for a long period of time.....  before that i was enable to work........now i have  9 pairs of clarks sandals almost all the colours to match my wardrobe but i am still looking for other one in my size 5.5 at a good price.......but that size is rare....thank you very mush.........lyse dupont
214994	as always clarks shoes are high quality and always fit the same no matter what style you choose.  i can rely on them to be a perfect fit.  these sandals are so comfortable and the suede like sole is ultra soft and comfy.  i have arthritic feet so comfort is super important.  i could walk forever in these sandals.  the leather uppers are soft and pliable.  i would highly recommend these shoes.
215012	i have always been a perfect size 7 1/2 m in clarks.  one of the straps was a little narrow preventing me from getting my foot properly sliding all the way into the sandal.  my arch is a little high. i did what i had to do with another brand (crocks) and stuffed (a pill bottle) into the strap that was preventing me from getting my foot all the was into the sandal.  worked like a charm.  the show fits perfectly now.
215046	these fit great, i ordered my normal size and fit is good. they are very flattering and i am looking forward to wearing these on an upcoming trip. i think dickies has great quality at very reasonable prices. i am very happy with purchase.
215099	love these shoes. they are perfect for what i wanted. i plan on buying more in different styles.i highly recommend them.
215118	i am 70 years old and with these on, i feel like surfing! watch out women and waves! wahoo, john
215159	very comfortable and flattering. i also have dickies gen flex (which i also love) but the wink actually offers a more flattering fit. highly recommend these scrub pants.
215162	i am a nurse and am particular with the scrubs i wear.  the cloth is not thin and it has a lot of pockets which is a must for me.  the vendor delivered fast and it arrived in great condition.  i am thinking of buying this product in another color again.
215231	i favour clark shoes. i take a 9m in clarks and found these to fit true to size for me. these have a nice fit and are comfortable. the heel isn't overly high and gives me a sense of stability.  stability rates over fashion when you get past a certain age. i think i can have both in this shoe.
215310	pruct as described and fit is true to size.  fast shipping product made well.  this product is better than another style of jockey  i purchased from a different vendor this one is better because it does not have the fly
215539	i have a hard waist to find a waist belt for. i have a 25 inch waist. i like belts to fit tight. i usually have to custom size them and sew them. this belt said it's 26 inches so i figured that would be pretty close. most waist belts are around 30 inches and just impossible. it does fit; i wore it today with a tank and a shirt and it wasn't tight, but it wasn't loose either.i love the design and interlocking buckle. it's so cool. i think this is a very sturdy belt and i don't see any loose or poorly made parts that could fall apart. i see no reason this couldn't last several years. the whole thing is elastic which just stretches, and eventually goes bad, but it takes years. the front is very nice looking faux leather, i'm sure. the bronze buckle is very classy and i like it, even thought i usually hate gold accents.
215607	some of my most comfortable shoes are clarks, they are also often my least attractive,  so i was excited for these.  they look great, no complaints at all,  but not super comfortable.  they fit small, my toes are at the very end so push against the toe piece,  they soles are very thin and bendy without any arch support.  i di'd keep them because they are super cute but won't be wearing them as much as planned.
215668	love this sandal!  the perfect blend of comfort and style.  can easily wear with any outfit all summer long!  i'd consider it in more colors!
215730	this black skull top came in about 10 days which is fast. the fabric is nicer than expected and very soft. it stretches alot and bounces right back.pleased with the price and quality.
215731	i love this shirt. it was exactly what i wanted. very colorful and fun. i wish i could wear it all year round, but it gets too cold in ohio for a tank top!
215737	i love the soft fit, it has a bit of lycra and is clingy but not too tight. i really love it. i would order more and often from allegra k. the shipment arrives quickly and i am pleased with everything i have so far from this company.
215742	i ordered a large and what i received was so small it would not fit my 8 year old niece. i would like to return it, but for the price i paid it's not worth it.
215750	i'm 5'5, 135 lbs and my sister is smaller framed than me, same height and weighs 120 lbs.  i'm a 34b and she's a 34d.  i ordered 2 of these shirts both a &#34;us 6/ size small&#34;.  the blouse material was fantastic, super soft elastine.  was the perfect size at our shoulders and length came exactly where we thought.  only problem was in the belly area.  my sister wears 2 pants sizes smaller than me and we both had the same issue of it being way too tight in the abdomen area.  with the material being clingly that didn't help either.  i don't have a poochy belly, but looked like i was in my first trimester of pregnancy.if they could tweek the design cut, would be a little better.  i'm going to order a larger size and see how i make out.  maybe it's as simple as that.  will update then.
215767	i cannot bring myself to wear these any further than my mailbox. there is almost no cushion on the footbed whatsoever. even my flip flops have more support. they look just like more expensive brands, but they are very thin with little to keep feet supported or warm.
215789	bought this belt with the highest of expectations, because from the pictures, the belt looked well made and 100% leather. well, i was not disappointed. this belt is probably the best belt i've bought in recent years; it is well made, 100% genuine leather and its quality shows greatly. it is a snap-on style belt, meaning you swap belt buckles by simply popping up the the buttons and inserting the buckle and done.i had a great experience with the seller, my item arrived in a couple of days, but please keep in mind that i live in ca and i think the seller does too, so shipping and delivery may vary depending on where you live, etc.all in all, a great item and a great transaction. i'll be buying from beltscom again. a+
215824	this would have been perfect for my cruise if the zipper did not keep getting stuck. eventually it ended up breaking. i would not suggest this product. i did return it when i came home and received my money back right away.
215843	but they can't have it! super cute. i love it and i'm glad my fiance picked this compared to some of the other choices. the &#34;leather&#34; doesn't look or feel fake, which is always a concern buying fake leather items. looks expensive enough. love it.
215904	if i were an elephant this jacket would have fit my ave ms.... if i were a giraffe.... the neck woul d have allowed my face to show!!..  poor jacket for a short person.
215918	probably the best jacket i have ever owned!  the color (light pink) is exactly as picture shows.  the jacket is very light-weight but is not bulky.  it is also very warm!  inside is a nice soft fleece.  best part is the long sleeves!
215930	"i saw thule bags at the apple store and was inwardly drooling to myself.  such a detailed bag.  i am a person who adores compartments and pockets in almost anything.  when i got the chance to review this thule bag, i was overjoyed.  this is an incredible bag for airport travel.  i haven't taken this pack on a trip yet, but i can't wait.  oodles of zippers and pockets to store my chargers, pockets on the sides for water bottles or cylindrically shaped objects.  (i have some great tupperware cups with lids that i put snacks in, thus ensuring crush-proof eats.)  i love the ""safezone"" crush proof compartment for sunglasses.  genius!of course this bag is incredibly protective of my macbook, kindle fire hd, and ipad.  and all of them can fit in this pack at the same time.  i like that in this gray color the interior is not black.  not sure how the interior of the black pack looks, but i hate when the inside of a bag is black.  it makes it a lot harder to find stuff inside.  love the ergonomic zipper pulls, which are attached by nylon cord.  there is a jangle factor when walking around with this pack, with all of these zipper pulls swinging about, but usually you won't hear it if you are anywhere but inside your quiet house.the pack is very comfortable to wear.  it is padded, ventilated, and every detail has been well thought out.  even the hook handle (above the back straps, where you would grab it to pick it up) is padded.  with all of your electronics loaded into this pack, it will be a bit heavy, so that padding is a nice touch.  the only thing i worry about with this pack is losing it.  it is a very handsome bag and i would not want anyone to walk off with it, even if it were empty."
215948	this is a beautiful ring. just right stone size. very clear stone. just sparkles like crazy! comfortable to wear. i plan to wear it every day for a long time! :)
215971	this item took forever to receive from china. it doesn't look bad (although the head looks a bit too flat) but the dragon's bottom jaw is sharp and scrapes your finger as you try to put the ring on. it's impossible to wear and i don't know what else to do with it.
215999	it is clarks, so i will not talk about quality, i will talk about size, before i purchased other clarks size 12 which is too large, so this time i purchase this item on size 11 it is good somewhat large but it is ok. i usually wear size 12 on sport shoes like puma or nike, now i know my size in clarks is 11.
216141	these were ok at first...not too see through and fit right.  i wore them three times and they ripped while i was putting them on.  like panty hose.  so, never mind.
216161	these were exactly as i expected them to be.  the colors were true to the picture.  i did not find them to be overly sheer, as other reviewers have mentioned.  the fabric seemed sturdy.  i can see that some reviewers found them to be overly large and baggy . . . because if they fit me as comfortably as they do - and they are very comfortable - then they would have to be big on smaller people.  can something truly be one size fits all, when &#34;all&#34; encompasses such a vast variety of shapes and sizes?  i am 5'4&#34; and weigh . . . well, let's just say i weigh between 170 and 190.  any more specific than that and i would have to kill you.  so how could someone 5' and 90 pounds find these to be just as appropriately form-fitting as i do?  in any event, i like them a lot and will be ordering again!
216220	these fit ok on me - i'm small/petite & usually a size 2/4  or small & these fit me ok.  i can't imagine, however, that these are truly one size, at least not as pants.  i would defintely not wear these out as pants - maybe in the house with a t-shirt as pjs, but these are more like footless tights than leggings.  you can see through them when i bend/stretch around & there is even a crotch sewn into them like you would find in pantyhouse.  you could wear these under a skirt as tights & wear some sandals but i don't recommend buying for wear as leggings.
216242	i'm in my 3rd trimester and find tights and pantyhose incredibly uncomfortable and really expensive if your are purchasing the maternity versions.  these leggings are perfect for wearing under dresses and skirts as a replacement for the tights i would normally wear.  i wouldn't wear these without some other sort of covering since they do get rather see through at the thighs and rear.  but then again, i'm hugely pregnant, so for skinny people that might be fine.  the material is a little shiny, which is fine for me.  the brown is nice and dark and true to the picture.  the waist band is extremely comfortable and fully covers my large bump.  the price is great so i'm very pleased all around.  i might go ahead and buy the purple ones to wear with my black skirts and dresses.
216257	these feel like cheap nylons.  they are grainy in texture, and are see through in the upper thighs and bottom.  more like footless tights than leggings.  i'll keep them for the price, but i wouldn't order any more. i order a pair in black, and one in caramel.  they color selection is the highlight to this brand (only ones i found the caramel color) and the only reason to order them.
216281	i was very excited to see these leggings fit me. i am 5'10, 235 lbs and i have a hard time finding leggings that fit. these fit beautifully and they were nice quality and thickness. would recommend!
216294	i loved this bag when i got it. it was the perfect size to fit my ipad, wallet, keys, & even a novel or two! the first three days i had it the findings on the studded straps broke... bummer... okay... now it wasn't so bad ass looking. i contacted amazon to ask if they would send me the straps and and they kindly refunded me $10 instead. today the same thing happened with the long shoulder strap and the purse and all of the contents fell on the ground again. this purse looks amazing but unless you aren't really planning on carrying anything in it i wouldn't buy it. :(
216296	i finally had the chance to order this bag after it went unavailable for almost a week.  once it came back to market and on a discounted price, i immediately bought 2 - one for me and one for my sister-in-law who also liked the design of the bag.  the bags arrived fast in a right sized box.  to my excitement, i promptly opened the box and examined the contents. i was dismayed because the first bag's diamond pattern is off (not as aligned as the pictured bag).  the pattern did not resembled a diamond, it's almost a trapezoid!  i went on and examined the next bag - the second bag is just as pictured.  the quality of these bags are inferior and it seems made of very thin pu material - as the saying goes... you get what you pay for.i will update this review once i utilize this bag.
216315	i absolutely love this purchase.  these are a little bit pricey but definitely one of the best purchases i have made (in the no-show socks realm).  i usually have issues because my feet are so small (size 5.5) and even though the socks are labeled as &#34;no-show&#34; they are usually glaringly obvious when i wear them with my flats.  not the case for these.  definitely can't see them even with my lowest cut flats.  and they are super comfy as a plus!
216330	well made and very comfortable to carry on shoulder. two carry handles fold down nicely and stay out of the way, but are handy when carrying over forearm. spacious without a huge opening so that contents remain private.
216360	i've always wanted an emerald cut diamond, but not the price or the waste such a stone represents.  this is a very satisfying substitute.  unlike the previous reviewer, i find the band offers the suggestion of fire, because it shows slightly when you look down on this stone.  the stone itslef would otherwise show the finger underneath and look more like clear glass.  the ring fits well.  if you wear a half size, order the lower whole size.this is a lovely substitute for a diamond engagement ring,appropriately sparkly without looking fake. it wears very comfortably with a plain silver band, which i happened to have (and bought for about the same pricce a few years ago) and makes a classy looking wedding set. guys, if you're thinking of popping the question, by all means offer this.  if your lady protests she wants a 'real' diamond on a platinum band, she's probably not the gal for you.the only negative i can offer about this ring is that the noderately high setting might snag clothing.  it is cunningly embellished with beading surrounding the stone and on either side on the band itself. much wiser than tiny stones, which tend to knock out, snag clothing and be uncomfortable to the fingers on either side of the ring. as is, this is a beautiful, elegant ring you can wear with confidence.  time will tell how durable it is.
216362	this ring is beautiful and a perfect size stone for a right-hand ring.  i would buy another as a gift--and most likely will.
216364	i ordered this ring expecting not to love it.i was so pleasantly surprised when it showed up!it's lovely! the setting looks like a crown and the emerald cutmakes it shine and sparkle like crazy!
216369	i just received these earrings and they are beautiful in person.  i prefer stud earrings, admire white topaz and the princess cut, so when i saw these, i decided to purchase them.  they look more expensive than what they cost, am pleased with these earrings and look forward to wearing them.
216400	nice styling with a color and the detail at the waist that gives it a somewhat slimming look, it's a keeper!
216408	i'd recommend this to my friends.  it's a nice, dainty little ring which is starting to become the trend.  it fit properly.  i like everything about it except that you have to be careful not to lift heavy items or bang it against things because it will bend due to the small diameter.  it's great for the price.  i love it!
216410	straps at bottom of shoe scrapes feet.  ankle strap fits but small and no room to adjust.  my feet are narrow to normal.  i do not have wide feet so this should not be so.  footbed feels good though and fits my foot the right places so i may keep but if a store was close by , i would return and order size up.  beware, order size up but if you have wide feet which i do not, forget this style shoe altogether.  these shoes straps are uncomfortable and this shoe is definitely not made for walking in all day unless you want blisters and corns, but it is so cute,  these need to be redesigned with roomier more comfortable straps
216411	i have 4 other pairs of orthaheel shoes of size 9 that are a little roomy. these ones were weird. the straps over the top of the foot were entirely too tight, could not even fit my foot into it, and yet the straps leading to the ankle band were too lose - obviously not the adjustable portion - it bulged from extra length going up either side of the foot (i hope this made sense).these were purchased through &#34;shoe gal&#34; and am still waiting for an email to see if they will accept the return(i put in my return form two days ago).
216418	i wear only orthaheel shoes due to an arthritic knee and flat feet now that i'm in &#34;older years&#34;-- these are what i expected when ordering except (1) the red color is much nicer than expected-- a dark rich red and not a flashy crayon red which was a by nice surprise as they look very red in picture online. (2) they are heavier in weight than my other orthaheel shoes-- these are &#34;dr weil's&#34;  and my first pair of these.-- but not too heavy-- appear they may out wear my other lighter in weight orthaheel sandals . they fit exactly like the other sandals-- so order your regular size-- are adjustable at 3 places - so much adjustment can be made- esp in hot weather when feet swell some.  received today-- will wear a few hours each day to break in as you should any new shoe- but i'm used to the orthaheel high arch from wearing this shoe style for over a year now. very happy amazon offered these at a reasonable cost!!!
216430	unbelievable comfort and beauty in a sandal and having the ability to custom fit the straps is awesome!!!!  i have heel spurs on both feet and orthaheel provides the support i desperately need to help reduce and prevent pain.  i look forward to seeing new styles with the same wonderful features. i highly recommend them.
216434	these shoes are comfy.  unfortunety, they don't lood good this a little summer dress.  they are a bit clumpy looking for a little dress.  they look fine with pants.
216446	this shoe has the excellent orthaheel fit and arch support and i love the color and design but the man made material upper part of,the shoe feels very scratchy and &#34;artificial&#34; - and for,this price of shoe it should not do that. i have 2 pairs of the orthaheel &#34;molly &#34; style and they are both comfortable and do not feel scratchy as this one does -- would not buy this style again but love the support the othaheel provides.
216558	i love orthaheel shoes because of the comfort they provide to the soles, arches, and heels of my feet.  this shoe provides the same as all my orthaheel sandals.  however, any shoe with a cute metal detail is going to be not as comfy up top.  for a dressy shoe, this is great.  i wore it all day for a wedding and had no real discomfort. great for something pretty!
216565	i have several styles in orthaheel. this fiji style is the most comfortable, due to the foot bed having a slight cushion. the color is a creamy white, which i found looks great with most any colors. i also got the turquoise , i think they call it jade. i wear a 7.5 wide, order orthaheel in a 7 and every pair has fit perfectly!
216607	this skirt is truly beautiful; it is much more attractive than the picture shows. it is fairly see through so you might want to keep that in mind when you are purchasing this.
216677	these are one of the most comfortable shoes and lightest for a sport shoe i have ever worn. i suffer from planters fasciitis and these are perfect.
216687	this is a comfortable shoe just not enough shoe for a nurse in surgery. great shoe for running around/ errands.
216745	i can't say enough how comfortable these shoes are! i have already purchased 2 more pairs so i can't run out of them any time soon! the memory foam in the bottom of these shoes make you feel like you're walking on air! they will definetly ruin you for all your other shoes ~ what took them so long to come up with this!?
216755	smart looking casual shoe, comfortable with good support.  good for walking/running and easy to slip on & off.  can be worn with or without socks.  hats off to skechers for this new design... i've worn skechers for years but this new sole is the most comfortable ever.
216859	i love this. it took a while to get to me because it was shipped from another country, but it's really cute!
216918	it's a lovely bag, but is heavy alone, but once it has contents, it is much heavier and difficult to carry. the cross strap works but can't usually on a daily basis ! nice though!
216926	as with most clark's shoes, these were a hit right out of the box. i ordered 2 pair of this style, one in the bronze and one in the brown. both are made nicely, fit as i needed them to, and are nice looking on my feet. very comfortable too - the insole is a cushiony material that bounces a bit when you walk.
216965	unbelievable  these shoes are the best shoes i have had on my feet in 10 years.  i will be ordering different colors as soon as possible... yes they are a little expensive, but believe you me your feet will be happy..  no pain what so ever even on the 1st day i wore them  for 9 straight hours.. you can ware them with dresses, slcks, jeans  or shorts... they are wonderful..
216967	i love these shoes, they look just like the picture and the soles are so comfy. but on my shoes they are very wide. i do not wear a size w but a medium width on all my shoes so don't know why these are so wide. that is the only reason i am giving them 4 stars instead of 5.  i will probably have to send them back, unfortunately.update: i got some gel insoles for these shoes and they fit fine and i am keeping them! very comfy, very cute, i got the coral color.
217078	i liked it except the back stap things at the waste are sewn so it doesnt let you adjust more. so it can fit tighter.other than that the fabric is soft and stretchy so thats a plus. also it does not include the leg tights!!!
217109	yoou sent 6 wide.  you better not charge the freight. you deliberately did this so you could charge the freight to my card. i will stop the charge if you do... i bought 2 pair different styles.  tina
217126	this shoe is very cute and comfortable, however, the buckle popped off the first time i wore it. such a disappointment- sent them back immediately.
217173	"i needed to get some belts that were functional for dates and office and this one is interesting. i am 5' 2"" with a short waist so the latch on this one is a bit big comparatively (covers my stomach).  so when they say wide they are wide. the widest part is 4"" and then the belt itself is 3"". it is a pretty off white, ecru, or creme color ... heck some may even call it winter white. it is not a true bright white. very professional so easier to wear with the office outfit than dancing. i love it even and with it matching my shoes perfectly, am quite happy with it. with a jacket on it looks even better."
217194	i bought these as a gift for a friend . they arrived very quickly and she loves them! in fact she wears them often!
217207	i have worn this ring/bracelet set several times and i have received positive comments on it every time! i did have the head and bracelet break, contacted the company and they are sending me a new on free of charge. it is a very different piece of jewelry and is very special.
217213	these are such fun pieces. actually very well made and clever in their construction. the only thing keeping it from being 5 star is the cuff chain is short and a little difficult to put on with the small clasp, but i have large wrist so for females it will be perfect. the ring itself is beaded elastic so i don't expect it to last forever, but they send two so it's just fine! an actual ring could be installed but this is meant to be an ephemeral product after all. get it! it ifs such a conversation piece!
217259	this shirt is super cute but the xl is absolutely not representative of an american size 18. (see pics) if the fabric was stretchy at all, then perhaps, but this fabric has no give whatsoever. i feel lucky not to have massive batwings, but had i, this purchase would have been a disappointment. as it is, i can fix the slight issue with bottom snugness, but be advised, order a few sizes up. :)
217318	"well starting positively, the color is really pretty. it's a salmon-y/beige-pink, not a baby pink like the picture but it's still nice. secondly, it's a good length, about mid thigh (i'm 5'6""). moving to the neutrals, i got a medium, according to their sizing that's a size 10. i'm typically a 6-8 but every time i order these ""asian"" things, they're so tiny so i just went and did the medium. it fits big, i definitely could have gone with the small, but it really wouldn't have made this dress much better. negatives, the material reminds me of a summer top sheet for a bed. it's pretty awful. also, the hem line along the neckline is sewed poorly, so it sticks out where my chest is and i have to keep tucking it in. overall, if go with a size smaller than usual and don't mind the crappy material and sewing, it makes an alright day dress."
217333	very light weight, but nice anyway the bow is a little big, fit very nice, i'm a size 8, and stand 5ft 6&#34; and it hanges just below my waist
217387	when i wear this innocent librarian blouse it makes me feel like a virgin...touched for the very first time. like a vi...r...r...r...gin!
217441	very light weight, kinda see through so just a warning. great little summer dress. perfect for pool wear with some sandals!
217449	gosh, i was so excited to put it on, i forgot that its winter! i know for fact that this is what i'll be wearing when warm weather hits! that and a bikini...
217454	i ordered in a medium size, which i regret because the elastic around the waist makes it look too bubbly around my hips and bottom.  if i had ordered a small size, i am sure i would be wearing it, but since i didn't, it will have to go to my next garage sale or to the salvation army.  not satisfied with it, but it is my fault for ordering the wrong size.  i messed up this time, not them.
217481	this sweater pretty much fits me like the manikin. i bought a size large because i have broad shoulders. i am 130lbs, 5'5, roughly a size 6, and size 34c. i love the length, and the pockets and upper arm fitting isn't too tight as other reviews had said.
217488	these pearls will make a nice addition to your pearl/jewelry collection. i have many pearl sets most much costlier than these and like these allot. first you get earrings and a braclet with the knecklace so you have eveything. i really like the magnetic clasp. they are not completely black but rathers has hues of purple and blue and whats even looks like green to me, yes there some imperfections, it has good weight to it as well. i think they would be great for casual ware there very pretty -it would have gotten 5 stars if they dropped the price a bit all things considered.
217493	my boyfriend picked out something similar at a local art show where a guy crafted one of these out of an actual wrench. his was much more rugged looking, and would be ideal, but he was not selling them because he had yet to &#34;perfect them so they wouldn't break&#34;. this is the next best thing-- i just hope it does not chip easily. made a good gift.
217519	the fabric is heavy--fits weird and i'm sorry it's in my closet.  if i hadn't washed it, it would be returned--now i'll donate it.
217539	fits nicely and feels like quality material.  my nephew really liked it (got it for his birthday), and he feels cool in superhero clothes.  his mom appreciates the extra clothes for school :)
217551	i purposely ordered wide suspecting it would not bind at the toes which they don't but the length fit like a size 7-1/2 not a 7.wonderfully comfortable on the heels and does not pinch at the ball of the foot but with nylons on, they do slip somewhat at the heel.looks great with slacks, jeans and even shorts, but doesn't quite look right with a skirt or dress.
217567	purchased these sandals for a family member and she loves them.  they fit her perfectly and look much nicer in person than online.a little more expensive through amazon than some online department store websites but amazon had the correct size and color and that sealed the deal.  arrived within a few days after order was placed, i was very impressed with that.
217628	perfect slide/wedge to dress up or down for summer.  very comfortable too.  i am 6&#34; tall, and these don't make me feel like i am on stilts.  also have these in champagne.
217635	lovely and very comfortable wedge.  seriously, these are so comfortable.  i also got one in another color.  i don't like doing reviews.
217660	this is a basic no nonsense watch. purchased as a gift, i was looking for something easy read for an older person and there are not a lot of options in the large/easy read women's watches. this does the job with no fuss. it is better quality than what you would expect for a $35 watch but nothing spectacular. as another reviewer notes the bands are synthetic leather, and very cheap looking. i opted for buying a nice leather band and deployment buckle to jazz it up. overall i am happy with the purchase, good basic watch for the money.
217685	i love them. don't get me wrong on this, they are really comfortable, and just the right height&#8212;not too high and not too low (although from the looks of it in the picture they do seem a bit low), and the design is really nice as well. i wore this for an all-day formal event, and during the first few hours they were fine, but a couple of hours later, the left shoe started falling off the heel, just occasionally though but it can be a bit of a bummer. (it must be that my left foot is just a wee bit smaller than my right foot though.) otherwise good shoes.
217686	i was pleasantly surprised to find that these heels are not terribly uncomfortable.  while i wouldn't want to wear them on a day when i would be doing a lot of standing or walking, i think they would be just fine for a day when i am mostly sitting at my desk.  the toe box is well constructed and did not squish my toes together.  also, the taupe color is a good &#34;nude&#34; for someone like me who is fair-skinned and does not tan much.  all in all, these are a very good value.
217707	i so appreciate have a place to buy an extra wide shoe in a classic style.  they are made very well, and the non-slip solesmake me feel safe.  as you can guess, i'm getting a little older and need to feel secure.  note:  the ww feels great in the toe area.  but, of course, the heel is a little looser as well.  not a problembecause i buy inexpensive inserts to fill in the gap!  thanks, lifestride
217716	i have been purchasing lifestride brand shoes as i have always had a good fit and find them very comfortable.  this recent purchase is either my 5th or 6th pair and i must say i am grossly disappointed  and is the worst ever lifestride purchase, not to mention that this purchase has cost me over $5500 which i will not be able to recover.i strongly assume that the configuration lifestride uses for the sizes has changed as this shoe is about 3 times larger than my current size and i am still wearing other lifestride shoes which fit perfectly.  not even purchasing insoles have helped as it leaves a large gap and my feet are still lost in the shoes so this pair of shoes cannot be worn.  given my unrecoverable expense, i will never ever purchase another lifestride brand again.  it is a pity i cannot go beyond 1 star
217742	i handle luggage from every aspect - traveler, handler, finder, deliverer. i absolutely loved the rimowa's features and quality but had no intention of spending $600 on a bag.  i spent $135 on a %100 polycarbonate, light weight bag with great wheels and low-profile handle with a built-in lock and a 10 year warranty and so glad i did.
217985	the plastic is not as clear as shown in the picture nor does it fit as snug.  looks a bit sloppy, but will do the job!  big negative it the horrible plastic odor that i don't think will ever go away! would not buy again!
218005	had to return this item due to sizing issue. not quite true to size. but on the upside, the return process was not painful at all & will be ordering from this seller again.
218021	sizes run wayyy smaller normanlly im a 2x 22-24 but on here i had to get a 5x ..just another way to make skinny women smaller n fat chicks fatter..
218037	my daughter looks like a princess in this dress. her friends at college have given her many compliments. she is plus size and she looks slimmer in this dress!
218051	it is junior size. not made for curves. the unfinished lace is shabby looking and i want to return it. i ordered 2 sizes up. still doesn't fit.
218079	cute and sexy but too small. i tried it with an iphone and glasses and it would not close. i can't imagine any smart phone leaving room for anything else, not even a lipstick.
218081	the bag is small but i think i can manage to use it for  this  event. it will go with many of my outfits.
218099	"i ordered this shirt with a bit of trepidation.  my son is 6'3"" and wears tall sizes.  i wasn't sure if it would be long enough in the body for him even though the neck and arm measurements were correct.  well, we received the shirt 2 days after we ordered (love amazon prime) and he tried it on, and it fit him well.  so thankful it was long enough and i didn't have to return it, but was confident in ordering because i knew i could return it if needed."
218104	got lots of compliments at work on this new shirt, fits great and does seem wrinkle resistant. good value for the money.  i bought several colors for work.
218107	nice, predictable fit and a nice feel to this shirt. being a van heusen shirt i knew what to expect and i am not disappointed. great price too!
218134	i usually wear a size 16 and prefer for the waist to be comfortable fitting which the metro style does. i wear the trousers to work and for going out casually. the colour is versatile (foil) and material is durable. happy enough with the trousers to buy two more pairs (black and a shade darker than the foil).
218150	"i am 5'8 and 142 lbs and a size 8 fit me perfectly. i haven't washed them yet however, so i hope they do not shrink. but even if they shrink a little bit i have some wiggle room. they are the perfect length for my 50 year old self. not too short, not too matronly/long. i like that shorts are going back to the higher waist like in the ""old days"", these hit a couple inches below my belly button. i would have given them 5 stars but the pockets are way too small/shallow and the back pockets are faux. when i walk i like to take my cell phone and a few other things and there's just no room in these pockets without stuff falling out. i will keep them because otherwise they are nice and good quality, well-made, but if good pockets are important to you don't get these shorts. i may take them to my seamstress to see if she can put in deeper pockets in the front if it's not too costly."
218153	these shorts are extremely comfortable and the material has a wonderful feel. they fit as expected, i am 5'3 size medium with chunky thighs so dont usually wear thoughts, but these really suit me :)
218312	the picture is deceiving.  it makes it look like the fabric is thick, but its not. if you want the bra to hide the 'headlight' look, it wont. its a bit tight around the ribcage, although the cup size was decent.  i bought the 38dd,and i normally wear a 38dd to a 38ddd. i feel like if i had gone up to a 40 it might have worked better. you get what you pay for. probably wont buy from this designer again.
218313	sexy color and it keeps the &#34;girls&#34; in place just which there were more colors. i would like aroyal blue and a purple color as well
218331	my daughter loves it, especially now that it is getting cooler outside.  sized pretty small, it fits her like a normal sweater does, not long like the photo shows.  she is still happy
218362	bought this shirt i like it my only complaint is it is thin which is good for working out but i don't like everybody in the gym to see through my top
218391	holy crap this thing is waaaaay bigger than the picture shows.  ew...and the flowers...there's two of them and they are cheap looking and nasty.  don't buy this
218393	out of the box they look nice but are surprisingly thin so i was worried they wouldn't hold up. after walking in them for a bit, i changed my mind because they felt really nice and looked great. unfortunately the very first time i took them off after walking the little treads on the side were already coming off. i mean they were holding on by a thread of rubber! these are too expensive for this kind of shoddy design. i wonder if all of the 5 star reviews were from people who had only done a bit of walking in them. i'm returning these. what a hassle. guess i'll buy shoes in store from now on.
218405	pink is one of my favorite colors, and i was so thrilled to be able to get the chance to own this pendant.  when it arrived and i opened up the box for the first time, i was happy to see that it looks just as lovely in person as it does in the photo. i make jewelry as a hobby and tend to be a bit fussy with the quality of products, and this is very nice quality, especially for the price range.the main pendant is about the size of a dime, and the pink stone is very bright, as are the surrounding white sapphires.because of the way that the chain goes through the two top sides of the setting, it also lies flat, and doesn't turn around the way that pendants often can.it comes boxed and inside a tiny little pouch, which is perfect for storing it in. the presentation of this is very nice, and it would make a perfect gift.my only concern is that the chain on this is very thin and delicate; for this price, i would have been surprised if the chain had been thicker, but it's so delicate that i could see it breaking easily with one accidental tug on it.unlike other reviewers, i've had no problems with the clasp; it's not overly small, and the spring hinge opens and closes easily.it's a lovely piece that is perfect for gift-giving -- or for keeping yourself!
218446	this piece is astonishing! it's simple, yet elegant. the light reflects from the swarovski crystals beautifully and the chain compliments pendant. it's versatile enough to wear during the day or evening. i would highly recommend this to anyone.
218568	i was really happy with my purchase until i gave it a closer look. the ball itself was covered in some cheap white paste in various areas, dulling the effect of the aqua blue.
218634	if this dress would have been just 2 inches longer i would have bought every color twice! so very soft and comfortable. my issue is that i am 5'6, 120lbs and have a butt on me. so the medium dress covers me but if i move slightly my hiney is out. too bad. =( i want a large!
218649	it's a tank top..not too much to say........it fits well and has quite a bit of support, so it's definitely feels high end for the price
218656	i am 5 feet 5 inches tall, currently 150 pounds, almost 8 months pregnant, and a 38d. i bought 3 smalls in hopes that they would fit my belly, and they do! with extra room too! stretchy gooodness right here!!! so glad because i didnt want to buy clothes that i would only wear for a few months(maternity, or larges). i know for sure that they will fit me perfectly until probably almost the end of my pregnancy and after when i slim back down again(i am originally 125 pounds and wore smalls). i recommend these for anyone!!!
218666	this pair of keds was purchased for a young lady who personally chose the style and color.she was very pleased with the sneakers, and reports that they fit perfectly.wearing trendy, comfortable footwear for school and fun time--it's all good!
218881	the youyoupifa fashion wrist watch is fun for my husband to wear and somone is always asking him where did he get that watch and who is the maker.
218955	the color is really nice and the fabric is soft and comfortable. even though they are designed for &#34;special occasions&#34; i still wear them regularly because they are really comfy.
219129	size - how it fitsi'm a size dd in bra and usually can wear between a medium or large top. i ordered the large in this top.lengthit's shorter than it shows.  hits just at the waist instead of just past the waist.waisti'm a size 12 in jeans so the shirt does a good job with not making me look big around the waist area.sleevesas for the arms...it's not as puffy as it looks in the pic. you can actually tell that it's all one piece since there's no real difference.materialdecent material for the price. no complains.packagingnicely packaged and it arrived on time.
219174	really like this.  for reference, i'm 5'1&#34; with a smallish frame.  i got the large, so it's a bit more boxy on me than what is pictured.  i think it might be too short, though, if i sized down, and, besides, i really like the fit.  it's one of those shirts that you'd rather have fit bigger. so comfy.
219181	it's super warm, comfy, cute, korean-ish, and is an oversize coat for fall and or winter as i've expected (i'm 5'2-5'3, 110 lbs and ordered the s, us size 4) excepts that:_the zippers don't work properly. they stuck as any time i tried to zip or unzip the coat or to pull out the hood. the zipper that hides the hood also stuck in my hair sometimes._there's a hole at the bottom as big as 2 of my fingers can come through as the same time due to defective stitches. i'm just so unlucky for this.i've just asked to return it and i'm still waiting for the seller to reply.it came 2 weeks soon, though, and was perfect to match with leggings or skinny jeans and boots.
219234	"i ordered this in an x-small because it was the only one i could find. looks like it was big enough. i was worried! i am 35-26-36 measurements and it fits fine. i love it! it's soft, fuzzy, warm. the reason i knocked off a star is that the sleeves are a little short and the hood doesn't fit. at all. it's way too small. i don't even have a big head or long neck or anything. i don't even understand. the hood must be purely decoration. the ears which i assumed were rabbit ears are really deformed too. like, ""wtf"" deformed. @_@;"
219269	"the material is fantastic. it's feels more like a heavier shirt than a typical sweatshirt (the kind that are soft and fuzzy on the inside) and it's perfect for fall and warmer winter days, maybe even on nippy spring nights. i agree that it's form fitting enough to show your shape, maybe even accentuate it, but still long (i'm 5'4"" and it's knee length on me)and loose enough to be incredibly comfy. as other buyers have said, it says ""stop killing whale"" instead of ""whales"" but, holy crap is that hilarious.as with all clothing in asian sizes, it is always recommended to get a size above what you normally wear. for most people, i believe this hoodie will fit exactly like the picture if they follow that suggestion. however, this is very likely loose enough to get away with it being smaller than your us size.overall, fantastic material, great fit, and ""stop killing whale"" on the front. just an all around great shirt. i definitely recommend it!"
219276	i am (sadly) suffering from the dreaded middle age spread. i am 5'5&#34; and over 150 pounds. i bought a size 14 which fit very comfortably and even made me look like i had a waist again! it does not have a shelf or other incorporated bra, but i did not find that to be an issue. i did find it a bit ample in the posterior, but i have never had an ample behind. i am planning to regain my more comforting size 12 body, and when i do i will be purchasing this suit again, and likely trying the white one as well. if you're on the fence about the price, miracle suits are worth it.
219285	very comfortable, nice flair to the bottom without looking like your hiding extra weight ;)  material is nice but can pill after washing.  would recommend
219287	this top is perfect for casual and work attire, it washes and dries very well, i would recommend this style for anyone
219294	i recommend this one, it's two pieces, sweater and tank. the material is a bit itchy on the sweater and the tank is soft t-shirt material. nice and long, fits well on my long torso, i'm 5'8 115lbs. all and all very cute and good for work.
219332	i snowboard frequently, but i always whine about snow getting in my sweatshirt. this prevents the snow from getting under my clothes and keeps me warm. it is also cute to wear around in cold weather.
219350	excellent suspenders.nicely tailored, carefully stitched, excellent clipswill recommend to any friend and buy againthank you very muchraul
219376	love the color. not sure the belt is one size fits all. it is more a small/medium to fit comfortably.
219434	these are made of a thin t-shirt type material.  they are very pretty and comfortable. the neckline is a deep vee.  i am 5'-4&#34; 110 pounds and am happy with how the size medium fits.  comfort is my main concern with pj's so i like them loose.  i laundered them using cold wash and low temp dry and they came out great.
219467	i bought these for my wife who is very active around the house. she tells me they are very comfortable and well made. they fit very well, are well sewn are of good quality fabric.
219522	when i ordered these shoes they said they were black. when i received them, they were actually denim. not what i wanted... they fit great and are super comfy, but don't believe that they are black! deceiving...
219557	although this is a nice looking tunic, the one i ordered online had sheer sleeves.what i received did not have sheer sleeves and the sleeves was what charmed me into buying the tunic i ordered from them online.i hate the hassle of internet returns, so i kept it since it was nice enough, but i am disappointed that what i ordered and paid money for did not arrive as i had expected.
219624	my son loved this shirt.  fits great, true to size, graphics are good.  he got lots of compliments from friends at school.
219668	wow! this dress is gorgeous.  it has a flattering fit and i don't have to wear a bra with it which i love because i hate those awful things.  it's really comfortable and fits as if it is exactly my size.  i am 5'7&#34; 120 pounds size 26 in jeans and 32b.
219671	i'm a size 16 or xxl and the dress is a snug fit.  that's the only complaint.  if you're a size 14 or smaller chances are it will fit fine.  it is a very pretty dress and it seems well constructed.
219727	i would recommend getting a size or two up if you want this to be below your butt or to be very loose. i like to use these tops to workout when i am feeling &#34;fat&#34; or bloated and this is not it. however for what it is it is nice, the fabric is thin enough to breathe in and the colors are as pictured.
219746	love this nose ring.  i've had my nose pierced and have always wanted to try a ring.  i have a very petite nose so this was a little big, as in loose fitting on my nose, so i had to bend it a little bit so that it cupped around it.  otherwise then gauge was true to size and very attractive.  money well spent, especially if you're unsure about a nose hoop.
219768	this worked well with a certain dress but elastic was a bit tight on me and left marks for a few days. the shape holds up after washing.
219774	this item arrived a couple of days before the estimated time frame, which was great. also it is a great fabric, lightweight and breathable but tight enough that it offers support. i wore this bandeau to work under my scrubs and had no problem with bunching or slipping down. it stays in place and is extremely comfortable. my only complaint is that it is pictured as a soft almost purple-y blue, but in actuality it is closer to an electric royal blue. that's the only reason i did not give 5 stars. otherwise this bandeau is perfect & i would definitely do business with this seller again.
219937	i would give these five stars except it seems like one shoe is larger than the other.  however, these are super cute and not terribly unfortable.  i didn't return these because a simple bandaid over my one heel and i've had no problems.  they look amazing with any outfit including jeans.
219943	i love this boots. this is my second pair. i recommend these!! they arrived right on time. i wear them all the time.
219960	i bought this ring because it was obvious how beautiful it is.  many pieces of jewelry do not come across as beautiful as they are, but this one did immediately.  i first passed it over, but could find nothing comparable in a black ring to this.  finally, i settled on it and bought it.  i'm glad that i did.  it fits a bit snugly but that is not a major drawback, because it is just fine, and the heat of the summer may have something to do with the fit.  don't buy a larger size than you normally wear because of this unless your rings already fit you more tightly than they should.  it's gorgeous and has occasioned several compliments.  i'm really happy that i bought it.  you will be too.
219998	i was a little disappointed when i opened the material seems very thin and didn't look like i would get any support, but once i tried on i was very happy. this bra does work, i ordered in the 34d, i usually wear a 32dd. like others have suggested it's a little snug but i think it's suppose to be.i don't think i would wear this strapless unless the shirt or dress i was wearing was a tight fit in the boobie area. when wearing with the straps it makes the boobs look fabulous.i was able to dance in this with no issues, bending over no slippage of the boobs, it holds the girls nice. the straps don't dig and the bra stays in place, i love that i'm not playing with the bra and my boobs all night. everything stays in place.for me it has been one of the better supporting bra's out there.
220000	i actually laughed when i got it.  it's hard to explain, but it's big and small at the same time.  when i tried it on, my ladies looked so odd that i couldn't contain my laughter.  and, there's no doubt in my mind that they would fly out at some point in the night if i wore it out.  don't waste your money.
220001	this would have been perfect except for the length of the bottom strap, which was at least 2 sizes too small. a bummer because except for that i really liked this item and would have used it. had to send it back though.
220006	i like this necklace very much, and wouldn't hesitate to buy another one.  the price was what really caught my eye, and thought it would be cheap looking, but it's not.  this would make a nice gift for someone also.
220072	i ordered a medium for my daughter and it is double her size.  she usually takes a medium too!  i think the stitcher got carried away when she was making the sweater!!  could you please send me a return address.  thank you.  sincerelysue3958@yahoo.com
220203	initially i was expecting a pack of adidas socks. but when i received this and put on a pair my foot experience changed for the good. these socks feel amazing and comfortable. most socks that i have worn have had that thick cotton feeling. these socks do not feel that way. in fact, they feel more like fitted foot wear very breathable with excellent support. i am far from being a fashion expert. but these socks are typically worn with my army desert boots and i have not one single complaint about them. in fact, i wish someone had told me about these socks years ago.when it comes to socks and under ware i tend to buy the pack that provides the best value. these socks has changed my way of thinking. i would highly recommend these socks to anyone that wears boots. they breathe remarkably and don't leave your feet feeling all sweaty.
220273	i have ordered this for my 9 years old daughter. she is a little bit taller then average kid and this age - she is 4'7&#34; and this tights fits good. also as they are 11 - 14 size she should be able to use them for some time. colour as on the picture, good strong tights, easy to put on.
220332	from the minute i got these shoes i was having trouble. first, the front strap was way too tight even though the sizing of the shoe was perfect. still, i tried to break them in for an event i had three days after receiving them. four hours after wearing them for the first time, the ankle strap snapped as i was walking down the street. these are beautiful shoes but i won't be trying them out again.
220349	i have only one complaint. the edge of the collar was not stitched/hemmed which gave the shirt sort of a shabby look. i have other shirts like this where the collar edge is hemmed. i didn't catch that in the photo. other than that the shirt fits great, is soft and very comfortable and looks good.
220532	i really like this sweater. it fits as the model. i did order an xl and im 140lbs and 5'6. do note that after you wash it the black skull will fade a bit, so consider air drying it.
220548	so i've ordered from allegra k before and loved the products, i've found that the other clothing items to be comfortable and i always order a size up just in case. however, the fabric used in this particular item is significantly rougher and less comfortable than my other allegra k items. it's still cute and fits well though. hopefully a wash with fabric softener will help!
220555	it isn't a sweater material, more like softish tee-shirt. get it in your size! it hangs perfectly on me, flattering and loose where it should be. i get complimented on it a lot. highly recommended! mine came smelling a little... chemically, but that's to be expected. it airs out.
220684	this women's xl is about the size of a child's 8-10. wayyyyy toooo smallllll i would never this again :-(
220859	these gloves stay on but the palm area is a little tight on me and i can't stand to wear them for more than an hour before my knuckles hurt.  i usually wear a size l gloves.  also, the length is only 12&#34;  material is soft and does not itch.  i like them but they are not the length shown in the picture, which i knew from reading previous reviews.
220892	fun colors and design. i am 5'7&#34; and found the length of the waist not to be long enough. arms are long.
220896	this shirt is pretty cool ,true to size and nice thick cotton material i bought the green one looks just like the photo .like that the sleeves are different colors and also have a thumb hole if you choose to use it .i am just gonna roll the cuff up to cover them.a great shirt for winter and lounging around my house.
220904	i like the look and fit of this shirt, as another reviewer said, the thumb holes are about half an inch off of where they should be, so it's not really comfortable to wear the them as it slightly twists the sleeve.
220910	this shirt is so cute, i wish i had one for every day of the week. it is soft and stretchy, and fits well. i ordered the xl, and it fit me just right. it is soft and comfy enough to sleep in , or lounge around the house, but proper for casual wear too.it is very unique,  i wish now i had just ordered 2 or 3 because it was so inexpensive.  order this, you wont be sorry :)
220963	the shirt fits just as the picture shows. i love it and since it's so long, i wear it with leggings and its looks really cute.  and after reading some reviews about the cheap materials from this seller, i think the material is actually pretty thick and not cheap.  would recommend it.
220970	the quality of the blouse is not good at all. so it can be used just in house. also the delivery time was a bit long and i think it ships from china. i have no idea how can i return it! :(
220984	i really love this top, i was pleasantly surprised. the quality was better than i expected, and it looked great. i'm 5'7, so i ordered and xl, because i wanted a nice roomy fit. i understood allegra sizes to be for very petite asian women, and always order xl or l. this has worked very well for me.the fabric was good quality, and the top looks just like it does in the picture. it's already a go-to top that i've worn several times, because it goes with a number of items in my closest. it's nice and warm, and the sleeves fit well, too. perfect to look casual, yet look pulled-together quickly.
221011	nice top. it fits well on me and it covers my behind which i like.  the buttons on the top are very cheap and plastic but the top is definitely worth the price.
221038	i love my shirt, it fits perfectly. i  wore it twice in one week. i like that it covers my bottom area,in a nice way.
221081	a shirt made out of thinnish t-shirt knit material.  the seams are well sewn.  the photo makes it look almost like a hoodie but it is not.
221164	ok, ladies.  the review on allegra k's clothes are confusing because it seems people love or hate the clothes.  well, this is my first time purchasing anything from this line.  listen, i'm glad i did.  what i did was 1) picked out my most fave thing from her line 2) followed the sizing info provided by the company providing the item 3) took a risk and just bought one.  doing it this way you are only out 10-12 bucks so why not?i'm glad i did.  i ordered a small, which said it was a us size 4.  i'm usually between a 4-6 or small-medium.  this was scary because all the reviews say this stuff runs small and then too big. and it's all soooo confusing. what's a girl to do?!? ;-)so i just followed the guidelines given and ordered the small.  it fits perfectly for me...maybe a tad bit bigger than i would like.  but, i got sooo many compliments on my outfit. people just loved it.i wore it with knit leggings, a white scarf and thigh high heelless boots and people called me a snowflake princess.  ha!  i think the material is a good quality...but again, i don't mind cheap stuff. .  i shop at forever 21 all the time and  take good care of all my items (don't dry!) and my clothes last forever.  so, on that note...just give it a try!!! it's worth the gamble. i've already ordered two more shirts. can't wait till they come!!! :-)
221174	i thought this shirt was going to be longer to where i can wear it as a dress, but its short. i guess i can wear it with leggings.
221186	the fit is pretty good, a bit short but that's sexy.  i didnt give the the item a higher rating because the stitching on the hems and inside were loose in some areas, and not very neat at all.
221249	hurts like h*ll. i only purchased jessica simpson shoes because everyone on the reviews kept saying how they felt wonderful. i'm here to say heels are heels and not made to feel comfy. though i've yet to break them in...my first day wearing them gave me heel blisters & my arch areas felt so relieved when my heels came off.
221320	i really like these flip flops. they are very cute and very comfortable. i live in flip flops during the summer. it's hard to find a &#34;dressier&#34; flip flop that is also comfortable to wear. these do the trick.
221331	i was so disappointed to send this shoe back but the straps were just not tight enough.  it fit perfectly, the arch support (which is what i was looking for) was good, and it seemed like there would be little if any break-in period.
221339	this pendant is really cute.it's big (about the size of a thumb nail)and it's really good for the price.it arrived on time and fits perfect c:
221376	i recently bought it from macy's as i did not see any deal at amazon. i usually avoid paying full price. this is my third g-shock/baby g and 7th casio digital watch. very pretty unique color and can be worn dressed up or down. the band is a lot more comfortable and a bit longer than my other baby-gcasio women's bg1302-2er baby-g blue bezel shock resistant watch. i just wish it has solar power likecasio women's lws200h-8acf solar runners 120-lap digital sport watch.it also matches with my medium skin tone. i'll post a picture under customer's image section.update 8/28/13: it has been about 9 months since i bought this watch in late december and i wore it more than any other watches i have. i wore it to the swimming pool ~4-5 times a week and the color is still as new. i just rinsed off every time i came out of the pool and sometimes washed off with body wash or shampoo i use to clean up the sunscreen/lotion (i used both indoor and outdoor pools). now i have well-tanned skin tone and this watch looks great and i am thinking of buying another for backup :)
221379	i bought this watch for my girlfriend and she loves it.  she always comments on it and one of her friends saw it and had to have one too!
221395	i went by what they suggested and ordered the extra longs.  however, they are far too big on me, even tightened all the way.  i'm going to try to take a tuck in them to see if that will cinch them up some.  they did work for the dress i'd intended to wear with them, but they were so loose the bra didn't actually fit properly and things started to flop around a bit.
221399	i'm 47 and wear these after playing tennis for 2hrs.  normally my feet would be soar and could not wear shoes and hated walking around after playing.  these shoes have tremendous cushioning and feel great.  allows me to play and do other activities without aches and pain.
221402	great shoe.  perfect fit and very comfortable.  grip is a little iffy on wet tile, but otherwise great.  price was great too!
221433	i thought it was going to come with the chain, but it looks cute and is easy to fit to a chain!
221513	cant beat this for the price. i paid around $6 and it is worth it for the fun. looks good on and fits nicely. i ordered black
221542	these shoes are too large for a size 8m. overall they are nice shoes but i had to return them because they are too large. i  ordered a size 7.5m in black and the fit was good. yet i ordered a size 7.5m in light taupe and they were too small.
221560	like the stylle, the fit, and the price. addidas make a great product. i have already purchased several more. love it.
221591	lovely sheen to shirt which looks great with black trousers for a dressy occasion.  would be great for an evening where you had to be dressed with a tie or bow tie.
221613	i luv it!!!! specially the fabric!!! is anti wrinkle!!!! so cute i totally recomend for this summer !! im so happy
221629	this is one of the most comfortable sandals i own. it's versatile, in that you can wear it with almost anything. looks great with dresses as well as more casual clothes.
221652	nice weight cotton -- heavier than i expected -- and the fit is spot on.  these wash well, too -- no shrinkage if you wash/dry on cooler temps.  i wear these as night shirts, and they're they perfect length for me.  definitely happy with this purchase.
221671	my twelve year old loves these i don't know about that one size fits all crap, cuz i am 145 and she 102 and its pretty tight on her so i wouldn't even try these on. no man.
221704	i decided to give these a shot after newport news discontinued my holy grail tall girl leggings.  these are okay, but not what i was looking for.  the material feels very soft and breathable, and i could honestly see these being someone else's holy grail leggings.  but i'm 5'11 and they just didn't quite cut it for me in terms of fit.  the rise was too short, the length was too short, and they didn't stretch enough to compensate.  if you're average in height, i'd say definitely give them a whirl.  tall girls should probably keep looking.  [update for tall girls: simply vera wang solid leggings are the best i've found so far--high enough rise, they actually reach my ankles, plus the material is nice (mostly cotton) and you can even put them in the dryer.  they're not quite as comfortable as newport news, and maybe just a touch shorter than the newport news tall sizing.  but the best i've found so far.]
221724	i bought these for my daughter and i to share. we've been wearing them for a couple of months now and none have broken or caused any skin discomfort or discoloration. my daughter has actually had hers in every day since the beginning of november. she is two years old. they are definitely good stainless steel earrings.
221735	i am a 35 year old wife/mother/student. i have been looking for a nice looking, comfortable, trendy pair of jeans. i wanted something that wouldn't give me the dreaded mom jean butt. the pockets on this are closer together so they make my small, flat butt look better. also, not too low of a waist. the slim legs make me look taller and thinner. to think all these years i avoided pants that would have made me look thinner and taller just because i was afraid they were too tight-looking!  i look ten  pounds lighter when i wear these and the bootcut tends to even out my top heaviness (i'm a busty gal).  my husband really likes these on me as well and thinks they are sexy without looking like i'm going clubbing. i feel like i have successfully found a sexy, practical, comfortable non-mom jean. and i don't feel self-conscious wearing these because i feel so good wearing them.i really like the color. the midnight rinse is very dark which looks a little dressier. i also ordered these in medium wash since i loved these ones so much. i don't think i'll be buying regular jeans again. seriously, these are that good. there is now a permant place for these in my wardrobe. actually, for several of these.
221737	i was unsure what size to get- i'm 5'8 190 lbs. and the large fits well. as stated by others, they do ride down in the back which is annoying. and they are the perfect length if i'm in flats, but a bit short if i'm in heels. super comfortable. wish they had a better variety in boot cut.
221741	they fit just as the picture shows. i am 5' 2&#34; 120 lbs. with an athletic build. and the ones i bought were a size medium. and they look just as they do on the model. not tight, but hugs the curves. being fun size and all, they came to just about my ankle. so i roll them up. which kind of takes away the tulip bottom. but that's ok. i was after something to lounge around in only. not to make a fashion statement. one last thing. the waste band is a bit high. but that just helps to support the tummy a bit. it takes some getting used to if you're used to wearing lower wasted jeans.
221763	this necklace was unusual, there was one part of it that looked like a cross, which i do not wear, i liked the necklace so much, that i was able to use some wire cutters to remove the part that looked like a cross.  i have not worn yet, but will very soon.
221795	i love the look and feel the bracelet. i've tested out the fire starter and it does the job. paracord bracelets are becoming a major &#34;fashion&#34; statement among outdoors folk and survivalists and i can see why. i love hiking so this comes with me.
221881	i was a little nervous about the fit after reading the reviews but i decided to get my usual size anyways. i was pleasantly surprised that it fit perfectly. it also arrived sooner than expected. i haven't washed it yet so i don't know how it will hold up. if it holds up well i'm going to order it in more colors.
222012	these work great in the shower at the gym.  they fit perfect and i love the pink!  makes me feel like a little girl!  lol
222018	appreciate the style of this, purchased for daughter and although its rather 'dainty' its appearance is lovely and my daughter loved it.
222031	slippers are comfortable but the long logo on the heel's cushion can be felt on your feet and tends to be a little uncomfortable.
222091	like others said, smaller than what i thought they would be, but still gorgeous and i also got a free cute pair of earings with them...
222103	these look great with the necklace and they are so tiny that if you have long hair they should pull their hair up because the earrings will be lost in the hair
222186	first i ordered a medium but didn't know how to return it. then i ordered a large and came smaller than the medium. so now i'm stuck with two that don't fit ????
222207	if you are looking for a cardigan sweater, do not get this. it does not provide as much warmth. but i got it because i have some sleeveless shirts that needed coverage. so, the reason why i gave it only four stars was because i found that on the corner of the left pocket, there was a long string of thread sticking out. so i looked and it was no longer a pocket. and yes the material is very thin, but very soft. so if you are looking for something warmer, i would recommend something else but this is still very cute :)
222238	received the dress earlier than scheduled...awesome! it is super comfortable and cool. i am slender on top but have hips so the dress fits perfect around my curves. the color is beautiful along with the flower pattern. i ordered 2 belts for around the waist, so far the belt i have received looks great! brown is a perfect accent to use with this dress. it can be casual or dressy. a pair of brown strappy sandal heels will look awesome! love!
222255	"i was a bit disappointed in the material of this product, very thin, stretchy and almost see through but once i put it on it looked quite sexy and my husband said 'what's wrong with a little see-through' ;). i love this dress despite it's very delicate/cheap material. at least the type of material works of this dress/shirt. fits me just like the model. i'm 5'3"" and 105lbs"
222272	"i ordered two dresses from lindy bop. the sizing is really off (small) by at least one whole dress size. also, the fabric is very chintzy and does not ""hang well."" lastly, i ordered two different dresses; i ended up (and was double charged) for two of the first dress (same color, same size????)and one of the second dress. i am going to send them back. darling in the pictures, on par with wal*mart in quality. too bad. if they were made of decent fabric and sewn better, they would be stunning. as it is the dress ""laney"" is see-through and has no lining. you really can't even wear it without a full slip at least (and probably spanx). the other dress i ordered is red, but just as cheaply made, and the fabric is so thin that you can actually see through a burgundy-red dress! they should double the price (if needed)and just make these dresses look like they do in the ad. i would have bought the dress at twice the price if i could actually wear it to work. really cute concept, very poor execution."
222279	love lindy bop dresses but had to return this one due to being a bit tight in the chest area. return, refund & reorder all no hassle.
222290	this on runs small and be aware it will need ironing!! not the best looks better in pics. got awhile back beware cuz cost too much to ship back! so be sure you want this one. they will try to work with you if not happy.
222365	i didn't find this to work as well after the first time, but still worked. be aware if you will be sweating a lot, this will fall off. i went to a club and ended up having to go to the bathroom and put it in my purse bc it starting falling off while i was dancing. (it was summer in thailand) the first time i wore it i was mostly inside and had no problems.
222372	the adhesive doesn't stay if you have to readjust. there's no push up or pull up action. a total waste of money.
222376	another tricky lady secret! you *can* have cleavage! it's important to follow the cleaning directions and store these properly! do not exceed a few hours wearing if you have sensitive skin.
222486	these shoes are perfect, exactly what i was looking for.  they fit true to size, seem well made and are so cute!
222530	lovable!! so comfy....so many congrats on them.... color great, the strap makes it sexy! they are high for going for a walk around, but for a normal day at work they are perfect.
222555	these charms are of poor quality and are only appropriate to use on a far less expensive bracelet, rather than a pandora.  i put they close to the lock on my nieces pandora braclet just to fill it in temporarily.  i promised her better things to come.
222558	looks great, just as it does on the site. great purchase, fits well on my pandora bracelet and compares to my pandora charms.
222566	nicely crafted, inexpensive purse. it's faux leather but is a good-looking faux, it doesn't appear cheap & it's wearing well. the pocket features are well thought-out and the straps are long enough for me to wear over my small shoulder, but wouldn't be for a larger person. interestingly it comes with it's own quite nice storage sack, the exact same fabric & style of storage sack i received with a $$$ purse a couple of years ago; surprising for such an inexpensive purse. also it has little leglets on the bottom so that it doesn't sit directly on the surface of wherever you have to set it down, a feature also usually only seen in $$$ purses.the range of colors is a nice feature & i expect i'll buy one in another color to go with other outfits - it's worth having more than one color at this price.
222624	bought this for my girl and she love it only gave it three star because it could have been a bit bigger she say's.
222632	this is not a well made handbag. not as big as i thought.  piece of low quality junk. couldn't return or exchange cause waited past deadline.like the size and shape but poorly made.  handles too short. center zip pocket not sewn into lining at bottom so any loose stuff in it floats around the bottom from one side to the other. very cheap lining material. inside pockets too short for iphone.one of those sorry i bought things in back of closet.
222677	these shoes are awesome.  i love them so much i bought them in pink as well.  very well made and suprisingly comfy.  they are true to size and the silver ones have a dash of sparkle.  soo cute.
222731	loved this short, super cute and comfortable. i got these in white, no issue with the fabric when wearing beige underwear. very comfy.
222795	i'm kind of in love with these. they go with everything. i've worn them a few times now and i don't see any obvious wear, so they can't be that cheaply constructed--i'm kind of abusive with my shoes. they are mostly comfortable, but arch support is lacking and they do get tired after walking for a bit. overall a win, i'll probably end up ordering another pair in a different color.
222858	i love the fit and feel of these camis.  they are form fitting but not constricting.  i wear them underneath a sweater and they feel like i have nothing on!  going to go back and buy in every color!
222911	i bought this shoe for my wife  because she thought it was a fun look, even though our son told her that at 60 she was too old for it.  she was a little worried about the width because she usually wears a wide width, but this medium worked out fine, although those with wide feet may need to wear a thinner sock with it.  its very comfortable and she's received a few i like your shoe comments.
222923	"i got 2 of these in the sapphire and eggplant to wear in my nursing job. the colors are exactly as pictured and they are very  lightweight which i was pleased with because i don't want to get too hot. the colors are nice especially the eggplant, but i wish they offered it in a charcoal grey. they are very soft and i really like the look of the ""woolrich"" signature that is visible on the back of the collar. i do wish it was just a tiny bit longer and i think if i went a size up it would have been too big in other areas but overall, i would say the medium fit me nicely. i'm 5' 6"" and a size 10. i also wish the pockets were deeper. i need enough pocket room  to carry my iphone, bandage scissors, hemostats, a pen and a handful of alcohol swabs and i don't think these pockets can handle that but that can be resolved with cargo scrub pants. overall i'm pleased with this purchase."
222991	this hat was nothing like the picture or the written description. not thick and/or plush at all. item was shedding in the package as i opened it. appears to be a child's hat that's had an additional piece of fabric sewn inside (like a gusset) to make it bigger. the fabric is very thin and scratchy on the inside. returned item even though they charge a 20%(!) restocking fee. i also had to pay return shipping. i sent it back anyway. will not be buying from this seller again. very disappointed!
223022	okay, keep in mind... i live in california and it's october. i own these in hot pink. if you want black boots to wear every day i recommend forking over more money for real leather. anyway, i know a great pair of flat/riding boots cost roughly $200. i own a pair. these were purchased for fun and i don't regret it. i wear them more than the $200 pair! for what i paid, i got my money's worth. they don't have cushion but, the interior leaves plenty of space for you to add your own supports. i wore them to the office with a matching hot pink shirt and black skirt. they loved them. i have no idea how i pulled that off. hahaha! i wore them to a garbage concert. shirley manson! who-hoo! i stood on my feet at the palladium in hollywood for 3 hours. i had only mild discomfort b/c i hadn't bought my inserts, yet. these are velvet and they are so soft! women clearly could tell that they were velvet and drooled over them. i think i just made amazon and qupid some money. ;) i love them and so will you. make sure you are certain what size you are. measure them at a shoe store. ie payless my feet shrank from a 9 to an 8 within the period of 3 years. i don't fit any of my old shoes and went shoe crazy on amazon. these pink velvet boots are one of my favorite purchases. both men and women loved them and asked where i found them. i want them in every color. they're true to size. i'm a thin/average women but, they have a ton of extra room if i were more curvy. buy them and enjoy!
223033	"when i was considering buying this, i noted that the company advertised ""all shoes are carefully inspected...."" but when the boots arrived, the stitching on one seam had come apart before i received it.  i then tried to make use of the company's ""365 days easy returns.""  but they refused to believe there was a defect.  they refused to pay for the return unless i sent them pictures.  so, i have posted the pictures here for prospective buyers to review."
223109	sorry, i read the reviews and thought i would love these, sadly i hate them, crams the 4th and 5th toes together, not at all comfortable, so sorry i bought them
223127	i purchased these for a trip to costa rica, to wear on the beach and to have some quick drying shorts on hand.  so far i've only tried them on - no field test yet - but i like them.  i usually wear a 10 in pants/shorts, but thought the 9 would be too small so i ended up ordering an 11.  they fit pretty darn well, despite being the slightest bit too big (for anyone who's an actual size 11, these would fit true to size).  i suppose that's what the drawstring closure is for, in addition to the hidden snap closures which are a great touch.  there is also one pocket on the side with a velcro closure, big enough to hold a wallet or whatever small items you want to have with you.  i felt iffy about the 3-inch inseam, but after trying them on i feel they're perfect: they are short enough without looking mom-ish, but long enough to provide enough coverage. for the record i am well beyond being a junior, and these do not run small relative to women's sizes like many other clothing items labelled 'junior.'  overall i would recommend these shorts.
223189	these are my favorite yogur t pants. got a medium (thats what i am), and they fit really well. maybe itll make u feel better about purchasing something u havent tried on, so: they make my butt look fabulous!! i get compliments on them everywhere i go !!! quality of life improved x14710mill ~**~*~
223211	but they will be good to use for swimming when i hate to have my thighs exposed.  they are very lightweight and comfortable which is why i wanted to use them instead of a regular pair of shorts.
223232	lovely neckpiece. dresses up an outfit. they should offer them in various lengths and in more colours. good buy. quite satisfied.
223276	i love the way this fits and drapes! very cute and sexy! wish it came in more colors!this brand is consistently great!
223374	cant go wrong with this under armour hoodie.  material is top notch. wears well, and keeps you warm and dry. it holds up extremely well after washing and looks just as good as the day i bought it.  don't bother with cheaper hoodies, i've decided it is best in the long run to get quality first.
223419	i bought the orange color. very soft. true to size as well. will look nice with work wear as well as jeans. thanks!
223438	the top i received was turquoise and not the blue color shown. decided to keep the top because i can use one in turquoise for my wardrobe.
223644	"i had this hat on my wish list of ""fun"" things maybe for christmas. however, i had a problem that the my doctor diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia and she told me to wear a warm winter hat to keep my ears covered.  i ordered this through amazon prime and next day delivery.  this hat is not only cute, but it is warm, sturdy and fits well.  i was a little concerned about the fit because it looked like it was made for someone younger, but it will fit an adult head easily.  it is very soft and comfortable.  this is a good quality thick hat.  i was not happy to have the problem i had but so grateful that it pushed me to buy this hat.  i am set now for winter.update: april 6, 2014 ... well with this past cold winter this hat got a lot of wear and it has held up well.  it was nice and warm especially paired with the matching scarf. both are heavy and thick and perfect for cold weather. i can't emphasize enough the tightly woven knit that gives it such protection in the cold."
223658	nice scarf, not as long as the original but just right for a tween that you don't want tripping everywhere. the price was a little high, but i needed this for my son's costume.
223709	as others have mentioned, the materials for this dress are quite cheap and it doesn't really have the nice hourglass shape to it in real life as it does in the picture. i have an hourglass figure, but this &#34;dress&#34; was bulky and didn't fit in the right places, i am a size 10 so maybe i'll have to go with the large next time. still though, it can be very fun to wear and it always gets guys pretty excited when they see it :p
223717	i bought this just on the off chance that it might fit, but it didn't.  i have a bit of stomach fluff and a dd bust.  i had this unlaced all the way and it still did not fit the stomach area was too tight and the bust area too large.  not made for persons who have that particular shape.  i am exercising so hopefully it might fit sometime in the future.dec 4th 2013after doing lots of research on waist training and corset i measured this corset and realize it did not match the sizing chart here.  i have posted a link of bslinger size chart on here to help others.[...]
223743	we have had no disappointments with the corsets from bslingerie!they arrive as described, just remember to read the sizing charts, which are different than uk or us sizes.the lacing is a great feminine touch, especially for hot weather fun, or worn under a partially opened over shirt!
223766	i bought this for my mom for valentines day. she was very happy with this corset and plans to wear it out to bike week. this corset arrived on time and fit nicely. i wouldn't recommend sizing up cause this is very adjustable.
223814	and this is huge!  and zipper? what zipper? it has little hooks that are flat and can not catch the other side.  its a real shame that this product did not live up to expectations.  guess i'll tuck it away till the next fashion swap party...i'm sure it will fit someone else just right.. if they can get it to fasten together!now, i hesitate to get another corset from this company unless its a xxs with a zipper.  ;-)so, in short...this item runs big, very big...like 2 sizes too big.  :-(..other than that its cute.  just not meant for me.
223837	i have a 38c chest.  that being said, these bras are absolutely perfect! they are comfortable. they do not bite anywhere. they keep my breasts in place when i trail hike and power walk.  you might want better support if you run.  these do not give big deep creases along the back, and provide a smooth look in the front. i highly recommend!
223851	these are not a very high quality, but for the price i could forgive them for not being super duper. however, the package - even before i opened it - smelled so terrible of (i'm guessing) mothballs (or worse, some other unknown chemical) that my entire mailbox smelled bad. opening the package, the smell was so bad that i cannot possibly keep them. will look into sending back, but in all likelihood will just have to throw them away (and not even in the kitchen garbage - they are going outside, bleccch). what a waste!
223870	i was so excited to order these earrings, but i was so sad when they arrived and i actually saw them in person.  the silver settings are very nice, and the stones were a perfect size for me, but the stones didn't come close to matching.  one stone was beautiful and sparkly, but the other one was very dull, not sparkly, and a different color blue than the other stone.  i was so disappointed and had to send them back immediately.  i am giving these 2 stars because of the nice settings, but if i was rating these solely on the stones, i would have to give it is one star.
223907	i am pleased with this top.  it is comfortable and attractive.  i purchased the wine and black for a slimming effect.
223917	this shirt fits me so well! i really do like the fit. i am tall and lean so it is difficult to find and good fit for me but this fits do well
223924	this shirt is beautiful! so beautiful, in fact, that my 17-year-old niece wants one. the other reviewers were right: it does run small! i normally wear a size 18/20, but due to the reviews i ordered the 3x. glad i did, otherwise it wouldn't have fit right. definitely get a size up!
223946	this was my 2nd purchase of altra brand shoes.  i have the torin already and it's being closed out.  i purchased this shoe hoping it would have the same amount of cushion as the torin and it had about 30% less.  so, for me it didn't work as i need the extra cushion.  it was a little cuter than the torin and the raspberry / charcoal is really nice.  i had to return though and get another pair of torin's in black as it's my best and most comfortable fit.  if you like altra's and like a medium cushion, this is a great choice.
223952	this is really beautiful.  dg dolce and gabbana is so fancy.  the leopard print pattern is very exotic.  this sunglass case went very well with my dg sunglasses.
224000	the description of item is the same as actual product.  i love the watch, gave to my mother as a gift. look no further.  i  have three other michael kors watches for myself, this was definitely a great buy.
224019	i bought these for my friends and i for carnival, the designs are pretty and the stocking did  not tear or shred like the cheaper brands, they felt good on your skin....will buy again if needed...
224026	*update*back again for the large pack. the mediums creep down; they seem a little small. my son is 28 mos, wears size 10 shoes. hope that helps.size medium is sock size 4-6 for little kids shoe size 9-10. i have an issue with socks strangling my son's legs. he is very thin, no cankles on this kid, yet almost every brand leaves marks. i like carter's and the children's place for the stretch and quality but they are horribly expensive for just socks. these socks are soft, dense and have just the right amount of stretch to stay up without leaving marks. i don't buy 100% for anyone in my house (cotton is very absorbent and holds moisture against the foot keeping the foot wet) so i love the blend. cute designs... dinosaurs, trucks, helicopters, wagon with letter blocks...all boyish but not the designs in the photo. would rate 5 stars if they were made in usa.
224037	i'm sure they will fit someday...just not yet.  my daughter is a tall two year old...wearing almost size eight shoes.  these are still too big for her even though she likes to put them on sometimes.  after the summertime (when we probably won't be wearing socks anyway), these will get the action they seek.
224079	can't complain about anything on this top, can't wait to wear it with leggings and boots like the rest. very comfortable, wore it before washing but it didn't itch my skin.
224080	i ordered this and was very unhappy about it. i sent a note to the company and they have refunded part of my money since i just gave the product away. it is cheap enough and one gets what one pays for in general. so if you are looking for something cheap like this, it is ok but soooo small. if you want the arms to look like on the picture, you really need to order 2-4 sizes larger size than you are! a us size 6 ordered may fit a chinese size 6 person like this but a us size 2 person like this... be aware that their sizes are way off.
224087	it fits exactly like i thought, oversized, but it is not as stylish as i thought it would be from the picture.
224115	i ordered the pink and was very satisfied with the quality of the shirt. it is not very sheer and fits great. however they do run a little small. i ordered a small us since i am a 34b but the tag on the shirt said  medium. however i am assuming a small us is equivalent to a medium asian.
224127	shirt is very pretty, but i ordered extra small and it is still very big. i took it in under arms and now fits perfect.
224179	cute,cheap shoes for around the house or driving..perfect for san antonio fiesta clothing..comfortable and light weight for traveling..would recommend it highly
224206	cute, fit well, whites, blacks, with grey black brown beige pink and blue details. comfortable, the one with the black lace bottom is very very sexy and looks amazing.
224234	its adorable. not as vintage looking as i thought & the flower seems out of place but it's a cute bracelet.  unfortunately doesn't unhook so its a bit frustrating to get on & off
224251	most comfortable flat i have ever worn. has more padding in it than some of the name brand flats i've tried on.
224269	i usually pay a lot less for flats but i decided to get this one because of the good reviews.  i was not disappointed.  it looks great and fits well.
224270	comfortable and very cute. i love these. they are cushy too so even with my bad feet they feel good!
224279	i was looking for a chocolate colored flat and purchased these based on all the great reviews.  however, i didn't like them at all and returned them.  they fit fine, but they are the kind of flat that makes you feel like you're pretty much walking on the ground.  the little wafer-thin insole was also weirdly shaped such that i felt like the ball of my foot was stepping on the little arch section in just one of the shoes.  i guess they'd be ok if you just wanted a certain color and weren't planning on walking much.
224289	i have tried these on in a department store here locally. but they only had 6.5 and i needed a 6. so i ordered them, but they were just different than what i remember. they fit wider and even in the smaller size my heel would slip. don't understand why the big different but they seem like. a completely different shoe. these are going back. might try the suede looking ones or try another namebrand.
224363	i bought a bunch of these, as a black turtleneck is part of my standard everyday wear at work.  these are perfect.  they're stretchy, long like in the picture.  one drawback is that they are thin and a little  see-through if stretched, but if you get the right size, should be fine.
224400	wow!  i couldn't believe the prompt service on this heart pendant.  i just ordered it a few days ago.  i love it!  my grand daughter wore it first.  i should give it to her and probably will but i want to wear it some first.  great value for the money.
224468	i bought this dress for my grand daughter for christmas. she likes it very much...and the material was soft and the dress well made.
224475	even though i like the dress, the first time my daughter wore it, the top button on the back went missing. it`s the area below the neck where a child cannot touch the button, and the dress does not pull there either - like it would on the waist. so it`s a poor craftsmanship. now i need to drive to the jo-ann store, 30 min one-way, an hour drive altogether, just to get the same button.update: i emailed the company and they sent me a few spare buttons.
224539	i just bought it as a present for my fiance and he absolutely loved it! i looks even better once you get it!
224565	i have to run to my jewelers to get this cut down as i have such a small wrist..but this is one of the prettiest watches i own..and i have a fetish for watches, along with bags, shoes, jewelry, everything..lol..the rose gold is very soft on this and invicta is a great name..i got this at a great sale price..it is different than my collection of watches...absolutely lovely...
224577	this watch looks and feels great.  the quality far surpasses other look a likes.  it looks and feels like a $5,000 watch.  great addition to my collection
224585	love these sweaters.  this is my third sweater from patty and this one is my favorite.  these sweaters run tight so i ordered a xlarge where i normally would be a medium.  i didnt want it to be too tight.i am tall 5'10 140 lbs  and this sweater is perfect length with leggings.  super soft and just something you want to live in.  i wish it came in more colors.  one more thing, i ordered the heather grey and at least on my computer it appears to be more of a tan. but it is light grey which is fine.
224615	i purchased this plaid robe as a christmas gift.  it is a lightweight fabric, easy to pack for trips.  i see it everyday and it has been washed many times and still looks good.
224637	let me start by saying this dress is very pricey i bought this for my daughter that is going to a wedding its not what we thought. don't get me wrong its ok but not for the money. my daughter likes it not love it she does say it needs a zipper it worries her that pulling it on and off she might rip it. i don't think it worth the money wait until it goes on sell. i like to say it did come in a timely matter. didn't like how it was shipped, we had to iron it out of the bag. it's not that we don't like it but it could be improved on.
224639	and this leaves a gap at the chest. the rib cage is way too tight, tool loose at the top. needs more form. good quality material - and the belt broke immediately. i bought with fluff ( netted skirt) underneath and when worn together- it was lopsided- whether the netted skirt or the dress i don't know. i will be donating to a charity for girls who need prom dresses.
224721	i ordered these shoes in a 10 since i read a lot of reviews about them running small. the 10 fit great for someone who usually wears about a 9.5. these shoes are very professional looking as well. the heel isn't so high as to make walking around from 8-5 unbearable. but i will still plan to buy some cushions for the toes. also, after a long day at work, i had some rubbing on my ankle that left me a bit cut up, nothing that some moleskin on the inside of the shoes can't fix. i ordered these in both the natual and black and recommend them bothedit 10/4/13: i still like these shoes but man do they hurt my feet after wearing them 8 hours a day. i didn't think it would be too bad initially, but i needed the help of some name brand (not the cheap) gel insoles to help me out during the day. they alleviate some of it, not all, but i'll survive
224782	they are lovely when you first put them on and fit snugly then they bag at the butt so badly. i had to get a belt and put it on to keep them from falling down around my hips. the only solution to that is to wash them repeatedly. too bad. the yellow is really pretty
224806	i plan to buy more pairs of these as they fit well and are comfortable. planning to buy more of this color and a pair of black ones.
224808	i ordered these tights for winter and wasn't sure if they would work.  i'm kind of tall and have issues with leggings being long enough.  these fit perfectly and keep me warm.  now i need to find some warmer socks to go with them.
224816	good quality material, sewn nicely and stays &#34;up&#34; they don't slither down and they are comfortable. wear them to work:)
224820	i wore them the other day when it was really cold in michigan and they kept my calves really warm and my feet really dry. update: the rubber is starting to separate at the seams which sucks since i've only had them for like two months, and it's the beginning of winter. i still like them, but they apparently don't last long.
224857	i purchased this suit to replace one i have purchased many times which seems to be discontinued: the speedo aquatic xtra life lycra conservative ultraback which was perfect for me. this one looks pretty identical but does not fit under the arms. it is much too baggy and i have to return it.
224886	i will be purchasing more of this brand of shirts. excellent quality, color is true to picture, and good price. right size fit also.
224948	this is super comfy... partially as the sizing is way off on the large size. the pictures with the top suggest it can be worn as a dress... don't do it! this one is way to large, however it also way too short for any kind of dress... you can see your underwear in both the front and back. i am 5'11&#34;, which may be part of the problem there, but it is still way too short.
225043	i really wish i had a few more centimeters on my calves because these are really cute but definitely not for skinny legs. i'm 5'7 129lbs with very slender legs. even with jeans on they didn't stay up well so i folded the top in to make them knee high (they are definitely thigh high)
225055	i wear a size 10, which is the size that i ordered, but they were way too small. the boots, themselves, were great. i was very sad that i couldn't wear them because the size was too small but i gave them to a friend who is about an 8 and a half, she loves them. that was the only thing wrong was the size. order at least a size larger than you normally would.
225077	i'm never sure how things will turn out when i order online but these boots are great! i take a size 8 and i ordered an 8 - they fit perfectly and are very comfortable. they're a great heel height and i can even walk in them - i call most of my heels &#34;sitting shoes&#34; because after awhile my feet bones feel like they're going to push through my skin. they go over my knee and zip up at my calves (14.5&#34;) just right. i wore them with a sweater dress and black tights and they're sexy-beautiful.
225139	finally arrived and i am very impressed with how real my konov stainless steel gold neckless looks, and i can't wait to wear it.
225260	most bracelets do not fit me. this was purchased to see if it would.  it has a draw string in the back and  will fit anyone. so simple to pull it open then closed again, what a concept!
225267	i am very satisfied with my order!  i was worried when it only cost one penny, but this bracelet is very well made and the stones are very pretty.  since this is a gift, i am confident in giving it to my teenage niece.  i think she is going to love it!  i want to keep it for myself!  ha ha!
225278	i do not have a stick-straight figure so it is always struggle to find jeans that fit and flatter.  these are comfortable without being overly form-fitting, but they still have a modern shape and aren't baggy.
225330	my mom needed a pair of shoes to insert a heel lift after she broke a hip. these are comfortable and worked great for the insert.
225470	the product is nice fits my expectations is the best i've purchased not that great really is great, super great and fits
225507	i love it. fancy, chic, elegant and beautiful. it looks really expensive and actually had a very reasonable price. i'm a happy camper.
225549	pretty ring but  i was disappointed about the size. it is too small for my finger so i have to give it to my teen daughter. it is also small in appearance. this is a junior ring or for very tiny fingers
225561	diamond is loose. looks like a bubble gum machine ring. total waste of your money. used the box it came in for the tooth fairy lol
225564	it's perfect for wearing it everywhere with out feeling worried to lose it, besides everybody thinks it's a real one.its beautiful and love it!!!great pieces sold in fashion plaza
225570	really looks like an expensive ring! i love wearing it and get lots of compliments.  it fits nicely, and seems to be made of excellent quality.  very pleased with the ring, and it arrived very quickly as well.
225827	this is a very cute dress. it was going to be my receptions dress at my wedding, but just does not flatter my body type like it does the girl in the picture. its a little tight on my chest, but does give a little boost. i love the satin ribbon and the removable rhinestone broach pin.
225830	very nice fit, and soft fabric helps me sleep in a comfortable and attractive way without binding straps and areas that are too tight. i recommend this particular purchase for anyone who likes the way that it looks.
225867	was too small for my brighton charm bracelet, so i gave it as a gift! but nice anyway! my friend loves it.
225924	i got this item for one of the women in my family and she is happy with it.  fits well and is well made and reasonably priced at amazon.  best yet it didn't waist a lot of mall cruzing time and still not finding the right thing.  being a guy i get the &#34;what do you know about womens stuff?&#34; line all the time.  of course when i go online and find just what they want, at c cheaper price, in minutes they get real quiet real quick.
225939	returned this because the zipper on one of the boots wouldn't work and they were very small.  they also didn't have the next size up for me to try.
225991	my husband is on his 4th pair. seriously!  i purchase the avia because it's available in a 4e width that is truly hard to find in a walking shoe. next best reason - easy on and off with the strap closures, they do come in white but white shoes end up dirty so black is the best choice. comfort! first time wear is like an already broken-in shoe. he is delighted when i manage to find a replacement pair in his size,  thankfully amazon came hrough for me.i know that you are curious about this being the 4th pair i've purchased, so here goes: he loves these shoes so much that he now wears them more like a work shoe for outdoors, meaning some really hard wear on them. he wears them til they are ragged after they are no longer presentable to be worn in public. please do not take this to mean that the shoes are not durable. my husband is very hard on shoes and is prone to wear them every day, all day no matter what the weather or terrain is like, and i have to beg him to change shoes. i've actually hidden them at times. you'd think that they are the only pair of shoes he owns, since they get so much wear, but remember, these have a rugged slip resistant sole,(big plus!), a comfortable fit and easy on and off for a man on the go. great for walking and great for working.i should have ordered a second pair!
226090	my son wanted me to order these for him. i warned him that they would be huge and look ridiculous. he kept telling me they wouldn't... then they arrived in the mail and he saw that they were way too big and look way too fake.they are bigger than his earlobes, of course. i cannot imagine why anyone would want to wear these, but to each his own, i guess.when you go this big in size with fake jewelry, it is always a bad idea.i love (real) black diamonds. my engagement ring is black diamond with white diamonds on the sides. i have black diamond stud earrings as well as other black diamond jewelry. so, it is not just a matter of not liking the color or style... it is just that these are way too big and look awfully fake .. they do not even look like good quality fake jewelry. the stones look like plastic. do yourself  a favor and do not go over 1ct when buying fake stones, especially these.
226091	cute earrings. they are sort of heavy for the backs that are sent with them. they need backings w/ the disc so they stay put.
226102	received the belt quickly. i love the way to adjust the belt. this will be my dress-up belt. would recommend to others... alex
226117	fast delivery, most important the belt is made with good quality and it works like all other reviewers said, perfect and very reasonable price.
226149	this necklace would be great if the chain wasn't such a piece of trash!!! it turned colors(copper)!!!  the ball is a good size and it shines beautifully so i purchased another chain and problem solved.
226172	this bra is so pretty and the colors are great. i have the rum raisin and the champagne ones. the lace stays flat and the cups are so comfortable. i was sad that there was no padding. a warm weather bra for sure. some people said that the bra made their chest look funny but i have 38dd and so does my friend. we both tried the bra on and she had her chest look cone shape and mine looked round. hers looked smaller and mine looked larger. so the natural shape of your chest will show through because there isn't any foam padding. also the fit will be altered by how close or far apart your breast are spaced. these bras are so beautiful and comfortable, the price can't be beat.
226213	tight in toe box, wide in heel. back of shoe is low so heel can slip off. not cushiony enough.
226217	flat feet and tile floors are not a good combination and my nb running shoes are not the ideal lounging footwear.  these are great when i'm in the house; easy to kick off and slip back on.
226255	i have never bought jeans without trying them on... i am 5'8&#34; and 110 lbs. i have hyperthyroidism so my weight is really low sadly. i did not kknow my size so i used their chart on the website and ordered a size 1 reg... i have never in my 29 years had a pair of jeans fit and look so perfect! i bought 2 pair! i am expecting to gain more weight and they are strechy enough to let me grow more in them... i will be buying these jeans as my regular jeans as long as i can! great quality... fast shipping... beautiful pockets and designs! i have never been so excited about clothing before;
226257	i usually order levi jeans, just because there true to size and fit great. let alone last for the price. i am bigger for my height, so finding jeans that not only fit, but aren't too long or don't fall off my behind is hard. i will admit, i do love these jeans! there a lot cheaper than levi's, and are made great! i've had them for a while now, and the have lasted no problem even after many washes. i get compliments on the pockets, that they look like buckle jeans (buckle is a store located by me, that has $100+ jeans and are known for their fancy pockets) bought a few different pairs, and love all of them!
226301	i had a masquerade party this last weekend i went to and wanted a pretty quality mask.  i settled on this one because of the price and style after browsing amazon for the perfect one. it matched my black and silver mermaid costume very well.  it arrived quickly, well packaged with bubble wrap.  it is quite heavy, and it did take me a while to bend it to fit my face.  it bends pretty easily, but i wanted to be careful not to break it or 'crimp' it so it took quite a while to bend it to a shape that was suitable. while i only wore it once, this was my impression: the ribbon to tie it on stays very well, i did utilize bobby pins to try to keep it in place. it is heavy (well, it's metal, should've figured!) and the pressure on my nose and browbone from it was noticeable throughout the night, though not too uncomfortable, just...heavy i guess. i will probably play with it a bit more to shape it to better fit my face the next time i wear it, and will definitely put it on before doing my hair, as the ties had to go over my poofy hair and it didn't look so well after, but that was my fault :)
226314	it's stylish and comfortable. great for winter time. love it. it will be even better if they come with more color options.
226320	i love this coat. very comfortable and warm and it looks great on. i ordered an xl and i usually wear large. i wanted the coat to fit over clothes comfortably. the size is perfect and the fit is very flattering.
226327	after days of looking at sandals on amazon and ebay i settled on these  mainly because of the great reviews! they are absolutely true about these being the most comfortable sandals you'll ever own next to flip flops. i usually choose to wear flip flops year round here in fl for the comfort and ease of putting on and off but wanted some new sandals with a metallic color to dress up my maxi dresses and other outfits. i wore an 8.5 for years but after all the years of wearing flip flops instead of any kind of shoes my feet have expanded a half size so i almost always order  9  to not have such a to the edge of the shoe fit. these definitely run narrower than a typical shoe and my foot just fits length wise.  i wish they were a bit wider but they don't look funny or anything  i can just tell by the fit of the sole.  i am giving these a 5 star rating due to this being the most comfortable sandal i have ever worn!  they are quality made , the straps are soft and not stiff, i don't know what they are made of  and i don't care as long as they don't rub my feet raw  like most straps due for some reason. these have that broke-in feel right out of the box! i love the little bit of cushion and the non-slip, soft feeling surface of this sandal. feels like i'm wearing soft cushy slippers like dearfoams on my feet! i want every color now and will be reaching for these every time i want a subtle bit of bling to my ensemble!  best deal i ever got on a pair of sandals worth 10 times as much as i paid for them! only warning people with wider than normal feet to skip these (sadly for you).
226375	i was very pleased with the look and style of this sandal. the red and brown are a good combination. the sandal fit like a normal 7 1/2 n and has plenty of cushioning for walking and &#34;anytime&#34; use.  i like the elastic strap on the back, which makes it easier to get on and off and yet, holds it to your foot when wearing.
226388	sure they are not as 'trendy' as i would like, but they are decent for someone like me with huge, troublesome feet. i have flat arches and a messed up ankle and these are super comfortable!
226439	i bought these leggings for a costume, but i actually wear them a lot with regular clothes because they're so comfortable and cute.  i love the bright pink, and i love the capri length.  great leggings!
226467	i love wearing these. they are leggings with a skirt that is attached. i have numerous colors as after i bought one, i loved it so much that i have bought more. they are comfortable and go with everything. i love that i can wear it as everyday clothing or as more formal wear. they hold up very nicely and look beautiful on. i love that the skirts flare out and look very beautiful and that the skirt length is just right. not too short and not too long. it's a very versatile look that is not form body hugging and yet is so flattering.
226495	i was so excited for these boots. they fit fine but when i looked at them in the sunlight they looked dried out. i know they aren't real leather but they had like a whitish dry look to them. i returned them and am saving up for real leather ones one day.
226505	this dress is gorgeous.  the fabric feels nice, is washable, and doesn't cling.  i have an hour glass shape and this dress accents all my good parts wonderfully.  i feel so feminine in it.  why did women stop wearing this style?  it's gorgeous!  just order a lot begger than you normally would.
226563	these make a great gift! you get so many assorted pairs that are each unique & so funny. they are colorful and fun & definitely a conversation starter when your shoes are off. i don't find them immature since how often are your shoes off in a formal setting anyway? they are low cut & don't slip - a huge bonus. it's a fun addition to your wardrobe.
226654	they are a little tight in the shoulders i wear a small in the tops of dickies  but this ones a little tight , i still wear it
226655	i love this color (hunter), it is absolutely beautiful. the cut of this top could be better though. i bought it in small (i'm 5'7&#34;, 130lbs, small bust, usually wear a small in shirts) and it seems a bit big on me due to what i believe is the cut. the neckline on this top is very open, you can almost see cleavage when i wear it and the first time i wore it without a tank under it my bra kept peeking out. i am by no means a conservative dresser in my private life but i wanted to mention this since i know at my workplace, having my cleavage on display while in scrubs isn't acceptable.with a tank top this fits better, but is still cut a bit wide. the tie thing on the side is adjustable which i thought would help me keep a little bit of my silhouette but it actually looks weird when tightended because the top kind of balloons up under the tie and makes you look like you're wearing a babydoll top. i'd say overall i like this top (and i have 3 of them), it just wasn't the modern, trendy piece i was expecting.
226663	sorry, i yelled about it. these are my faves, i will find them in every color and i don't have any negative things to say about them. true to size, just as described.
226698	if you are looking for some compliments, wear this scarf, you will get plenty. ordered it in two colors and they are beautiful. flowers are not falling off. the shimmer of the material is beautiful. glad i ordered two colors, different enough to not look like the same scarf.ordered blue/green and orange/purple. lovely
226815	the socks are thick, warm, and soft; however, the material around the heel area appears fray after a few uses. the color around this area also fades.
226886	the shiny accents were a concern but they're not overwhelming. the size is as expected, a little tight in the toe box for me but should work fine for standard to narrow feet.
226948	these leggings fit me fine and i am 5'4 and normally wear a size 12 pant.  they are quite the showstopper! each kitten has an upside down cross on his forehead!!!
226997	this bag is soo nice and it looks expensive, i get a lot of compliments for it. its a little bit smaller than i expected but i still love this bag and it arrived on time
227018	the material is about what you expect for the price but the durability and look of the bag are awesome! i'm very excited to give this as a christmas gift!
227020	look carefully at the picture, do you see the end of the zipper?  there is a snap on the underside of that zipper tab where you can snap the end down to the body of the purse.  however the snaps do not line up, so i can't snap it down....which makes it stick out very unattractively.  i think this is a bit of a &#34;last straw&#34; for me.  too many of the &#34;deals of the day&#34; just end up being rubbish.i'm going to leave this sitting on my desk the rest of the day and decide just how much of a deal breaker the snap is before i decide if i'll send it back.also note, the brown is such a fake color, so if you order this purse i would go with one of the colored ones, then at least it won't look like it was trying to be leather colored and missed.
227058	when i look at this bag, i see a purse that screams professional. this is kind of bag that you take the most formal of occassions.  not to mention that it fits comfortable on the shoulders and you will still have space for all of your accessory. this bag rivals the likes of theprada mv515 prada tessuto vela nylon in black. i think anyone would be please having this bag thanks to its style and the fact that it is just a great purse.
227080	after reading the reviews and also ordering other shirts from them i decided to finally get this shirt. i usually order a size up which is a 2x-3x and all the other shirts from evogues have fit great. this one ran small and was very very very itchy like other reviews have said. if it came in a bigger size i would of just worn a shirt under and got a bigger size but they don't have any. not worth the price to me. not happy with it.
227094	you have to stretch the ankle strap waaay back while sliding your foot into the sandal. it may sound a little daunting at first, but then they slip on just fine. their cuteness makes uip for it. getting them off is no problem. nice color and very pretty bejeweled front.
227158	i thought they where very comfy and the blue color was a little darker then the picture shows. but over all great bra
227176	i work outside in scrubs, and my synthetic sports bras were giving me some unpleasant back acne. when i looked for cotton sports bras to have some breathability for my poor skin, these popped up. without realizing it, i ordered 2 sets of these bras, but man am i glad i did! they are very comfortable and even flattering with the deep v neck. my skin is already a lot clearer, too!
227244	very nice bag and love the color i chose...the only drawback is i can pack the kitchen sink in it...very large...only need room for my wallet and cellphone and kindle fire.....haven't carried a purse in years so will take some getting used to...had many compliments on it the first day i used it...really like the attachable strap so can be used crossbody...
227317	excellent product, very good material and beautiful color, perfect size, i'm happy, very good product excellent product, very good material and beautiful color, perfect size, i'm happy, very good product.excellent product, very good material and beautiful color, perfect size, i'm happy, very good product.
227335	i really love this bag. i just wish it was bigger. am still on my quest to find a bag big enough to carry all my bits and pieces for work.but i really do like this bag. it is simple and classy.
227336	it's a very stylish brown and even cuter in person than you might think from the picture.  it also is very sturdy and i can't really think of any negatives with the exception that it is a little smaller than it looks in the picture. so don't think you will be getting a spiral notebook in there comfortably. i don't think most people will want to use it for school anyway. :) so i recommend this highly.
227364	really cute with sun dresses. light weight ... stays in place on your foot. not really made for long walks as the sole is very thin...but they don't pinch or rub anywhere either.
227371	i've noticed lately that haviana's seem to be &#34;shrinking&#34; a bit.  not a lot, but the soles are about 1/16&#34; smaller on this pair than an older one so they look &#34;small&#34; on my feet.  i'll be able to wear them, but would like the old fit back.  moved up a size but they were so large my husband could wear them - lol  this style is really cute and if you have a narrow foot i'd say you would be very pleased.  i'll order the next size up and see if that solves my sizing issue.
227420	http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b009dnwfd0/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titlei bought 2 pair of the womens warm winter fleece lined leggings. i am so very pleased i will probably buy a few more pair. i read a lot of reviews before deciding on these they are exactly what a leggings should be you cannot. see through these they are not tights. they are a bit warmer than just tights would be and they fit great and.look great with boots and a sweater. these are an excellent product!g duley amazon
227421	i bought these leggings pretty much for winter as regular leggings just don't cut it when a breeze happens by.  these things were silly tight, i mean think panty hose in a small tight. thankfully, they weren't too expensive so i don't have a problem just using them as a last resort for home lounging.  i also will say that they weren't fleece lined either. more like a regular legging.
227495	as soon as i recieved this watch i had to get it out of the box right away.  it is a wonderful piece of workmanship.  i love the fact that it never requires batteries and looks great.  i got it for a steal on amazon and you can tell that it is an expensive watch just from looking at it.
227659	not the most comfortable of arm warmers. they're really cute, but i think i prefer the ones i made from an old dead pair of socks.
227683	at first i thought this was a dress. when i took the blouse out of the package & my husband was looking at it too. and he sais, that's not a dress. i tried it on & it was way to short to be a dress! so, i thought why not math the pink blouse w/ white capri's. i did and went to walmart & a chashier there told me 3 x's how great i looked. so, the blouse & i are a great match !!!  :)  thankyou, jennifer u.
227732	i have really &#34;picky&#34; feet! i absolutely hate it if i can feel the seam, whether it's at the end of the sock or across the toes. as a result, i've been wearing white men's athletic socks that i found at costco. however, the costco socks look kind of goofy, especially if i'm wearing regular shoes, instead of tennis shoes/sneakers. plus, they're too thick to wear w/regular shoes.so, i found these on amazon and love them! i can't feel the seam at all. they're thick enough to be cozy, but not bulky. i like that they have this pack, with one black pair, one grey, and one white. i also bought a couple of similar tommy hilfiger peds in all black, and i love those, too! they are my go-to socks, and i only use my old ones when i don't have time to do laundry and these are in the hamper.
227752	my 13 year old got this shirt/dress and let me tell you it is the most adorable thing i've ever seen her wear in my entire life.  she puts it on and rainbows start flying out of her ears and she floats off the floor and flitters around the house under the power of the majestic kitty cuteness.
227879	i am girl and absolutely love these sissy panties! the fit was just right and the rows and rows of feminine lace are a thrill. i wear these panties underneath a full chiffon petticoat. terrific for girls or guys!
227906	"its a really good bag in terms of quality but if you are looking for space, this is not what you want to buy.a 15""6  laptop can not even fit in it!"
227926	party dress in blue flower print size 4-5 is perfect for your child. if she is tall and a size 5, you might also want to try the size 6.
228001	love this fedora,we all need this fashion statement! great service,exactly as advertised ....the straw is comfortable and wears well
228047	these slippers took a while to arrive, but once they came they were exactly as pictured and really cute. i wasn't sure what size they were going to be, but once they arrived i would say they're between an 8-9 in women's.
228055	not a true corset as it is unboned. true dark black color with mesh and lace incorporated. some build in chest padding. fits my 22 inch waist perfectly, however, my chest ( which is only a b ) wants to pop over the top, so i have to wear a shirt with it. side lace up additions are lovely, show some skin. not for very heavy girls or large chested women as it is decorative and does not cinch and provides built in chest padding.
228065	they are the perfect size for my 18 month old with a 95 percentile head! the only reason i did not give them 5 out of 5 is several of the headbands had the rosettes glued too far apart and they look strange. the ones that have them glued close to each other are perfect though, and it is a great deal!
228070	these headbands are amazing!! what a great value for the money!  first of all, they are adorable. obviously the most important factor! :d also, the elastic is super soft and not at all too tight (daughter is 3 mths old currently), and they will fit her for a long time to come. compared to other headbands with the skinny elastic, these are a dream. other headbands always seemed too tight and would leave an impression on baby's head. these are somehow perfect.one of my headbands had part of a flower fall off, so i contacted the manufacturer and they sent me a new one for free. so, great product, great price, and great customer support. couldn't recommend more!p.s. the same day i posted a picture of my daughter wearing one of these headbands on facebook, 4 of my friends asked for the link and bought them for their own daughters. and, we get tons of compliments on them when we are out and about, especially from the ladies at church! :d
228093	these little headband is so soft & beautiful, i bought them for my twin grand babies, got a lots of compliment on it, definitely recommend it.
228094	i sent these to my daughter for my granddaughter due in july. she loved them!!!! she says they  are very soft stretchy elastic fabric and very well made. she loves the colors too. these remind me of the white ones i bought about 23 years ago. now you can have all colors , all sizes of flowers etc. i would definitely recommend these to any mom to be or now mom of a baby girl. great gift from friends or grandmas too!!!! a girl can never have too many headbands!!!! very pretty!!!
228117	when i came across this purse on amazon i knew i had to have it. the skull is gorgeous with tiny little rhinestone/diamond details all over it.  i just love it. however, when i first received this purse i did notice some loose threading on the handle of one of the satchels, i don't really use the satchel handle that much because of that.. i just use the detachable shoulder handle instead and that has held up pretty well with no loose ends.  also, unlike some bowler satchel purses this purse does not hold it's shape as one would think when you look at the picture. this was very bothersome to me because the skull is so heavy on the purse that it leans inward unless your stuff your purse with a ton of crap.  i hate that because the main reason i purchased was because of the cool looking skull on it and you can't really see it if it's leaning in all the time. still, this purse is gorgeous and i've never really seen anything like it so i am still very satisfied with my purchase i just wish it was made better. the skull and the studding are secured very well on this purse. i will probably purchase another purse from this seller/brand.
228118	too bad i bought for a friends birthday gift, she almost didn't get it! :pthe skull is great looking! he is the centerpiece of the bag and his is bling! he's got a great face, and little chains that hang down off near the corners of the mouth.like i said, if i hadn't been buying this as a gift, i would have kept it for myself.the material feels very nice and the inside is roomy. she can fit all her stuff and a 7 inch tablet in there with no problem.
228128	so i got this product and it came with the 'hand cuffs', middle one piece, and the g-string. i love it but i wish it was a little big shorter because since i am only 5 feet tall, it isn't fitting me just right. i think it would be perfect for someone who is between 5'3&#34; and 5&#34;7!
228135	i have an invitation to a person's 75th. birthday.  we are very close family.  i normally wear a dress in the summer months because of the ease and comments.  just slip on a sundress, no need to match a top with bottoms.  guess i take short cuts but you always look nice and it's much more comfortable.  but i wanted something new for the occasion.i first purchased this dress in purple.  when i received it i was a bit skeptical having never ordered a dress online. also it was just packaged in a clear plastic pouch and seemed to be quite heavy.  i did order a size larger based on some comments.  tyvm.needless to say i took the dress out of the plastic and tried it on.  it fit beautifully.  i do see how women who are well endowed may have problems with the way the dress fits but, unfortunately, i don't have that problem.besides the fit i was most impressed that even though it had been packaged that way there were no wrinkles in it whatsoever.the dress is a bit heavy weight but not bad.i liked the dress so much i purchased the red also when it came back in stock.if you do a lot of traveling i think this dress would be perfect because it doesn't seem to wrinkle at all.  the colors i bought i absolutely love.  vibrant but not over bearing.accessories should be no problem, at least for the ones i purchased, because there are a number of colors in it.very, very rarely will i buy two of the same product.  however, there is so much difference from the red and purple i don't think anyone would notice.like i said previously, this dress would be perfect for traveling as i can't seem to get it to wrinkle.  honestly, what's better than that besides the beautiful vibrant colors.hope this helps someone.
228182	for all ladies out there who were at the front of the generous breast queue, this will be the best most comfortablestrapless bra you will ever buy, normally i dread wearing a strapless bra because of the straggling discomfort youknow you will feel, this one does not dig in to your back or sides, it does not cut in under your breasts and amazing....... it actually feels supportive, literally a miracle bra. buy it. i promise you will not be disappointed.
228205	wrong color - received grey. the socks themselves are nice quality but needed the beige and received grey. i also bought them when they were less expensive so will simply look for a pair of beige in the stores as the price is no longer competitive. at least i will be guarenteed the correct color.
228237	the boots are really cute.  i think that having the size of the calf listed would have helped us to know that it would / would not fit.  disappointed that my daughter was unable to wear them...
228247	being a size 13  in pants and these are pretty great. they are not necessarily thick. they are thin but there is something about it that just looks like is is not see through. they do not roll up and are veeeeery comfortable to wear.
228248	boy now you want an under garment that makes you feel like superwoman,put on a pair of these. wow. i really liked the way they fit and the comfort they afford you while wearing them.
228285	this scarf/wrap, goes with everything. the colors are vivid and can bring to life any outfit. wraps beautifully no matter how you use it and is very versatile. the fabric is supple and light...the perfect addition for any season, not only as a scarf, but as a wrap to take along to a movie or any other venue where the a/c might make it uncomfortably cold.
228287	in the photo the background color appeared to be periwinkle blue -- my favorite color -  however it it grey.  the scarf is striking, very unusual and nice graphic design.  the pink color is brighter than it appears in the photo. i am pairing it wit a true periwinkle color scarf from cashmere pashmina on amazon with a very nice belt loop that i purchased at bj's.
228289	the size and shape is consistent with the image, but the colors in person are hideous. it's all beiges and dull muddy blues with some day-glo pink thrown in for some reason. just really, really cheap looking.
228292	just love the way it flows, it's very attractive yet casual and lovely.i have three wraps from this seller and rotated them according to how i feel. they are lovely, the material is good and makes you feel pretty.
228303	you just can't depend upon the size for nydj pants anymore. my other pants and capris size 4 fit just right but these are just a little too tight all over. the problem is their clothes are not made in the us anymore like they are supposed to be. i am very disappointed in them for doing this.
228304	they get dirty easy when i wear them around my grandkids but what else would you expect from white pants. order one size down.
228396	it was jsut perfect. classy n lady like. just perfect for me.as i expected and imargined.the color is beautiful..everything i ever wanted...
228412	the scarf arrived as expected and not having ordered one before i was a bit nervous.  i opened it and the black color was absolutely beautiful!  it was very soft and way larger than expected.  i have used it several times now and it works perfect for me!!  i'm really thinking about ordering another in a different color.
228421	the are quite comfortable, but a little larger than the sizing. love the color it goes with everything. they arrived on time and in a shoe box. i would order from the seller again.
228434	these are super cute and comfortable red flats. the color is bright and beautiful. they fit very true to size so keep that in mind when ordering. the material feels very velvety and soft. i love them. would recommend to anyone who wants another well priced, cute pair of shoes in their collection.
228445	this scarf looks just the way it does in the photos. it's a very cute lightweight circle scarf. i chose the red color, and it's not too bright. the pattern is very cool. it's pretty thin, but still warm. it wraps twice and even three times around my neck, so it's pretty big. i bought this scarf mostly because i really liked the pattern, and because i like the circle scarf trend. i would recommend it to someone who wants a patterned, colorful scarf. keep in mind that it's not for the dead of winter. i'm very satisfied overall.
228477	i purchased these shoes in brown/gray. they are extremely cute and, in my opinion, comfortable. they are definitely not of very high quality, but serve their purpose well. the shipping from this company may be a bit expensive, but i bought two pairs at once, so it made it a bit more economical. the only problem i had with these shoes is that they had a horrible chemical smell to them when i opened the box. this smell has lasted for a few days, despite gently wiping them with a soapy towel and airing them out on my patio. it is dying down a bit, so i can live with it. realistically, they are reflective of cheap shoes made in china...but they have a lot of style and personality. i cannot comment on how quickly they wear, seeing as i've only had them a few days. however, for the low price i paid for them, i am not expecting them to last past a few months. we'll see how it goes. i do love their cuteness though!
228522	patty boutique strikes again!  i have ordered many of patty boutique's items and have loved them all!  i always order a medium size in everything i order from this seller and they always fit perfectly.  the quality of the items are always amazing too...well worth the prices.  i can't say it enough, this seller is simply amazing.  i will continue to buy clothing from patty boutique because i have had nothing but success!!  thanks patty!!by the way, patty boutique, can you create some more work-oriented clothing in which the bust line is a little higher than your other shirts?  i love love love your stuff, but would love some more work related items.thanks!!!
228527	"i was expecting the collar part of the shirt to be a woven cotton like a button down dress shirt, it is a stretchy t-shirt material. not that i mind. at all.this shirt looks just as cute on as it does in the pic. i'm a size 10 or 12 depending on the brand, and 5'4"" with a d cup, so i usually have to go one size up to accommodate the girls, but i took a chance and got the large and it's a perfect fit. the cut is very forgiving and flattering without clinging to all the wrong places. i have a curvyish figure and it's tough to find something that fits up top that isn't too loose in the waist. this definitely fits me everywhere. and as a bonus, it could be dressed up with a cute pencil skirt or worn with jeans and looks classy either way.i will definitely buy one of the other colors soon, and wish it was available in burgundy or red. i will also consider purchasing other items from this seller in the future."
228593	great for wearing with low cut shoes like flats,good color, nice fit, hard to find in others locations, happy shopper
228599	i wear these with boots all the time and other shoes that i don't want anything showing. they fit as expected. i have not had any trouble with my toes making holes in the tips and they stay on the back perfectly. i hand wash all my liner socks -- and you should too if you want them to last as long as possible without shrinkage.
228626	i purchased these to wear with my keds and they do not show. these would show with a more revealing shoe like a women's loafer. i purchased the larger size and i am a 9.
228630	love the earrings, perfect size to wear if you're just hanging out and you can also wear them when you are dressed up for a classy evening
228660	i love the style of the bag. it allows me to buy more than one bag.i love fashion bags. these bags are a good quality.
228680	i haven't worn it yet, but it looks good on the man and the texture is very comfortable.  i might wear it instead of him : )
228701	i'm not sure if i read this description incorrectly but it did not fit my larger chest. i suppose it'll work for smaller chested women. the material seemed soft enough and i think it would provide enough support if the chest is small enoughbut not for breasts over d's.
228732	while it is not high quality (i wasn't expecting that based on the price) it is cute.  i followed the size chart and ordered a large but it was way too small.  i am going to have to send it back.
228733	"so, i dress in vintage. all the time. i dressed this way before mad men. in fact, i've never even seen the show. but i love the color and cut of this dress. and let me tell you, this dress is everything the picture promised. i wear a 10 (sometimes a 12) and the sizing chart is dead on. there was even a picture of ""joan"" from mad men wearing the dress in the package. and when i put it on i totally felt like her. perfect dress, perfect price, and i love, love, love it!! i can't wait to wear it out!!!!!! if you were wondering if you should, you should!"
228744	i needed a good cross-body bag so that i could use just it and my wheelie carry on when i travel. two different orange bags were ordered from amazon, this is the one i kept. it's compact, but with enough divisions and space to store wallet, tickets, passport, cellphone, camera, makeup basics, without seeming too jammed. and i'm constantly getting compliments on the fun, orange color, too.
228783	just covers the width of your ring finger, delicate.  i usually like big bold rings..this is not that kind of ring, but i like it as it gives off this effervescent delicacy.  touchingly mystic and cute.
228794	cheap but didn't look cheap, i have a big butt and these still fit me and looked very cute on
228808	these leggings are very cool they look like leather but of course its pleather... i bought them to wear in atlantic city next month for anniversary
228838	nice sandal and a great fit. it adjusts to your foot by velcro cross straps. it is very pretty on the foot and very comfortable to wear.
228858	this dress is very elegant but is made of cotton so if you don't like you clothing fitting snug go for a bigger size, other then that my husband like it very much is a date night dress for sure.
228891	i am a curvy woman and always avoid clingy clothing so i was reluctant to try this dress however once i tried it on i thought wow it is form fitting but it clung to all the right places and didn't accentuate the wrong places! love the dress!!
228897	it is made of a heavy metal and the first time i put it on the cuff part broke off when i was bending it to fit my ear.  however they did offer to give me credit for it and told me next batch should be better.  i wouldn't order from them again.
228908	this 6mm ip titanium plain mirror glassy comfort fit weddinbg band ring is beautiful, although i would like to have the same in 8mm or 10mm if you have it please let me know.
228922	i love these earrings and wear them quite often. the hinges were a little stiff when i first started wearing them, but they have loosened up with use. they are easy to put on and take off, and easy to sleep in. they feel substantial but not heavy.
228935	description says 92% cotton.  this is wrong.  these panties are 92% polyester.  &#60;sigh&#62; fruit of the loom makes a nice panty, i like the style and colors i received, but i'm not too crazy about polyester.  but i will keep these.
228966	i own a number of casio's, and this is easily the most value for the least money of any watch i own. you have to feel it, out of the box, to appreciate the quality and solid feel they have put into this...it feels like a $190 seiko.the hands and hours and red-accented 'seconds' hand are all easy to read in all light levels. the bezel rotates smoothly with the quiet 'click' of quality. it feels great on the wrist. it's a large watch, but not overpowering or look-at-me gaudy.the rubber band is fine just as it is. personally i wear mine on a nylon nato strap.i haven't dived with this (it's rated 200 meters) because i have a seiko for that. but i've swum and snorkeled with it many, many times down to probably 15-20 feet, so it's abundantly waterproof for any normal water sports you want to throw at it.i am rough on my outdoors watches and i have not babied this one at all, but the crystal is still perfect, without scratches, and the watch looks like new two years later.this same model also comes with a black face/blue bezel, and a white face/black bezel. i have the black and the white face versions.if you're looking for a 'first real watch' gift for a young person, this would be a great choice.i found mine for $30 online, shipped. it pays to shop around.just a great watch in every way. hope this is helpful. happy times, everybody.
228978	ok before you think i'm completely off my rocker let me say this is a terrific shoe and is one of the most comfortable shoe i have had to wear. i don't run unless i'm escaping from somewhere or being chased so i use it for work (i'm a nurse) where i am on my feet all day. i have arthritis in my knees and need shoes that don't make my life totally ,miserable. these are very comfortable and really good to wear. i read the reviews and one said they &#34; run big in size&#34; well i ordered my size 10 1/2 and found it was small for my feet. had to send them back because i had to put arch supports in and if they're already a bit small this didn't bode well. no hassle return and the new ones (11) were here almost before these were in the mail. love them they're very good.
229059	great leggings, and very affordable, deffenently turning heads while wearing them , the seller has great things also very affordable and never worry someone else will wear the same stuff as you :)
229061	i'm 5'4&#34; 125lbs.  the leggings stop at the ankle bone on me.  look well well made and comfortable.  think enough that they are not see-thru
229075	i have big calfs already so i went with this boot style and they are still too big. my size 00 sister has them too and hates them because they are so big in the calf area for her. for me, with my jeans and leg warmers they fit like a charm. i am normally a size 7 and i ordered a 7. that is the best size once i have socks/leg warmers on. a 6.5 would have fit too but too tight then with all my jeans and socks.
229084	i ordered gray.  i love the color, it looks like metallic gray...it has 3 pockets inside and 1 pocket outside.  very lightweight so it's perfect to use to run errunds.  the middle has zipper closure on it where i keep my wallet and other important things.  the only thing i was not expecting was  the size.  it's too big for what i am looking for but it's fine...
229102	this was so very pretty. it did arrive flat like other reviews stated but mine came in a box so i did not have any problems with it being broken. it was very elegant and the picture does not do this any real justice.
229138	the legs on these are less like a straight jean and more like a skinny jean -- not what i was looking for. the fit is quite slim and probably a better fit for someone with a more slender build through the hips and seat.
229151	this sweater runs to size, i have long arms and usually have to buy a size larger so the sleeves will be long enough and i didn't have to do that with this sweater. very soft, not super heavy. it can be worn alone or with a top underneath. great sweater for the money, it was a very good deal especially for a polo, you'll love it.
229154	i love this sweater.i love how it fit not clingy and still makes you look sexy.wore this yesterday and my mil love it she love the color and she said it makes me look so thin.so since i got so many compliments on this one you know what that means.....i will order and get all the colors available thats for sure!anyways i ordered the pink and i thought it's pink and white stripes but it's really is pink and cream not white which more i like.
229195	and yet another fun and flirty dress or// and work appropriate attire. for this i went flirty on date night with just the dress and some killer strappy heels. it was way to abstract for colors other than black or white so i went with some strappy black heels and wore my hair (bright red view profile to get the idea) up and away from my face.the dress falls very nice a bit of a flair around the bottom and it at least falls a few inches above my knees it fit a bit big around the waist o it is a very good thing that it come with a tie.love it!
229196	the dress is such a perfect  the combination of the black and white design of this dress is a stable for spring wear
229197	cute and sexy and really like.  i am curvaceous woman and this dress really looks nice on me.  glad i picked it.
229202	"because i'm very tall, i often buy this type of top several sizes too large in order to get more length. i bought a size two sizes larger than i regularly wear. the first thing i noticed when trying it on was that the arm holes were ridiculously tight - i couldn't get them up my arm. i was appalled. who makes a shirt that size with tiny, thin little arm holes? what are they thinking?the over-all size of the shirt was also significantly smaller than would have been expected. i checked the label. it did list the size as the one i purchased. it's just... not that size. not by a mile.i ended up giving the size 3x shirt to my 5'6"" 120 pound daughter. it fit her like a dream.so if your regular size is medium, you could buy the 3x and have something that fits.i will never purchase from this seller again."
229244	this shirt makes a big girl look even bigger. or somewhat pregnant. it would make a great maternity shirt. but it is a very comfortable shirt.
229288	i put it &#34;fit as expected&#34; because the size charts are totally different than most.  as long as you follow those you should be ok.  it is fitted and if you have a curvy shape it will give a whole new meaning to the term &#34; wiggle dress.&#34;
229294	i receive compliments every time i carry this bag. a week after i received it the handle broke but i was able to fix it myself with a screwdriver. one of the stones fell out as well. i still love the bag. i just have to be careful with it.
229300	this is a phenominal bag!!  it's large enough for all your ideas but not overbearing.  had so many compliments.  someone asked who made the bag - i guess they were thinking celebrity or something.  great, great bag.  however thinging more for the fall / winter.
229361	this heel is really high, but the shoes are comfortable, and look more amazing than they do in the picture. i received them fairly quickly. no complaints. i wore them for my birthday and received compliments all night. i absolutely love them!!!
229389	i saw these watches online, they were something different, something i could add to my jewelry wardrobe. so i made the purchase. the arrive not in watch boxes but in a bag. they were all individually wrapped in bubble wrap and the watches were all running. once i pulled the stem out a couple of times the watches finally stopped running. these watches are light weight. the clasp are rather flimsy, and the packaging is not at al appealing, but for the price they are o.k. especially if you are not going to wear them every day. i have not worn my watches as of yet so i can't comment on how well the color hold up. the stones that surround the bevel are small and adds a little bling to the watch. i like the small stones. what else can i say for the price, this is a nice purchase.
229426	i get compliments every time i wear these, 1st of all.i wear them with the ruffly stuff just above the top of my boot shaft.they are comfy, they come up to my knees exactly as pictured with room to spare (i'm short, almost 5'2&#34;),so if you are taller than that, these should be fine.quality seems decent. i've washed them & dried them in my front-loader, sometimes inside-out, sometimes not when i forget, & no problems. i also got the red ones, oxblood color i think. they are exactly the same- adorable, comfy, etc.these are something just a little different for the wardrobe, too, but not *really* flashy or out there, which is nice.
229451	i love my fitflops. i own 40 pairs of fitflops. i'm a shoe-a-holic. i have well over 100 thongs including the fitflops. i have every color plus duplicates so i never i have to be without them.  every chance i get i wear a pair of fitflops. if i'm going to be on my feet, then i don't hesitate to reach for a pair of fitflops.  going shopping, wear fitflops. need a slipper, wear fitflops. going to the beach, wear fitflops. you can run them under water without damaging these thongs. this style is one of my favorites because they are so c-o-m-f-o-r-t-a-b-l-e. nothing rubs against your toes and the sole lifts you so you never fell concrete under the foot. your foot is supported with each step. i prefer wearing my fitflops to sneakers whenever i go on walks. i notice you get a better butt lift and quicker firming to my legs as well. your feet never hurt or get tired with fitflops.  in the fitflops line most of the shoes are utilitarian; these are no exception. order these sandals true-to-size (half sizes should go up a half a size). great for a narrow to wide foot because your foot is not restricted. nothing rubs against your corn or bunion. your feet will be in heaven. buy, buy, buy. don't hesitate; comfort is your reward for this purchase.
229507	once again these pants fit my girlfriend like a glove making her look like a million dollars, i can not leave her alone
229513	i simply loved it. looks nice, fits well. high waist is a plus. came on time by mail. i recommend it.
229582	i only wish it came in other colors. i have two black ones. this coupled with the 511 long sleeve shirts and i am good to go for a long day at the range. the second black one is just for casual wear. i love it's versatility and comfort.a must have!!!!
229595	beautiful design.  i love the colors, the lace, and the style.  but....  the chest area comes up way to high on it.  i still have it.  i'm thinking of finding someone who can alter it.  lower the chest part of it about 3 inches.
229709	these shorts are well made, comfortable, hold up well during washing and fit true to size.  they hit just about the knee and were a good price compared to what i have been seeing locally.  there is no belt despite the pictures showing otherwise.  but i don't normally wear a belt with my shorts so i wasn't too concerned.  the camo pattern is a nice variation from normal patterns offered.
229732	not the highest quality dress, but that's what you get for the price. still very pretty and elegant. overall it's worth it, true to size.
229778	super cute! i only gave it 4 stars because it looked a little dirty when it arrived, but it was easy to dust off and clean
229790	finding new shirts that my daughter likes in stores is one of the most difficult things in the world. she likes -some- girly things, but is mostly into what many would call &#34;boy stuff&#34;. when we take her into the girl's clothes section, 99% of the time she won't see anything she likes. i guess we got lucky when she got into minecraft last year, so much to the point that she wants minecraft shirts.and now, she wants pretty much all of them.the glow in the dark creeper shirt here looks just like it does in the stock image above, though the creeper isn't pale- he's the same green as he is in the game. once it's been around enough light for a while, it glows brightly in the dark. the effect is very cool, and since there's nothing else on the shirt, it's funny seeing this creeper head floating around in the dark, looking around for something to blow up.the quality of the shirt is above average. it's not the cheap kind of cotton like you'd get from american apparel, yet not so thick that your child will get too hot in it. as for the creeper face, it meshes with the shirt perfectly. some shirt companies print the design with a weird process and it feels like you're wearing a sticker or something on your chest at times. that's not the case here. my daughter loves wearing this shirt, and the design doesn't restrict her in any way.she's 7 years old and one of the taller girls in her class, wearing a large in girl's clothes, so i ordered the youth large size. it's a little big on her but it's fine. there are no tags, and the washing instructions and size info are printed on the inside of the shirt where the tag would be.if your kids love creepers, this is definitely the best shirt to get.
229809	super cute! light weight and pretty! prepared to use it for the rodeo season soon. perfect pricing for this item.
229812	i would classify this as more of a wrap.  it was larger than i expected.  that being said it was perfect otherwise.  i've worn it as a wrap with both a dress and a pantsuit for dressy occasions and it looked lovely.
229827	this is a very flattering and comfortable dress, available in black or purple. be sure to carefully read the information on sizing, because it is form fitting. it's probably better for taller women, as it will hit at the knees, where the ruching keeps it in place. shorter ladies may find that it is too long.i like all of the patty line products. i've several, and they are always flattering to most figures.
229850	although, this piece of garment has never been worn but it seems to meet all the expectations, such as pretty, soft, and fits great.
229962	very nice pj bottoms.  good quality flannel, i have washed these several times with little or no shrinkage or fading.  they are well priced and i would purchase them again.  bottom line they get a high recommend.
230016	i went by the amazon.com sizing chart, but these pants in a &#34;small&#34; would only fit sizes 0-2 (us sizes)  i am about a size 5, and would like to order a &#34;large&#34; in these pants, but i'm afraid, just the waist would be bigger, and not the legs.  my legs are not big by any means, and my calves barely fit in the &#34;small&#34; size.....very dissappointed.  i'm going try ordering a &#34;large&#34; and see what happens, if it's bad, i won't be ordering it again, period.  hope this helps.
230039	this was a birthday gift to him for his 10th birthday in december of 2012. i was super excited to open his present and see this. the quality of the t-shirt was very good (not stupid tissue weight like you see everywhere now) and the print quality was vary nice. the kids large fit true to his tall, lean frame.
230061	the bird wind capsule is pretty but i was a little disappointed in the chain, it really did have a little bit of cheap to it and i'm not a picky person.  however i will still wear it.  the color on the capsule is pretty.  it is the only piece that i have had to sign for from the post person when it was delivered.  kg
230087	i wanted a bracelet that looks realistic. the size of the stones on this are very believable. the one i received though, had absolutely no sparkle. none. you couldn't really tell where the stones began and the metal stopped, it was so dull. even worse, it came already clasped, and the clasp refused to open. it was stuck closed. i returned it and didn't replace it. wanted to love it...i'm glad others seem to have had better luck. will try again, sometime.
230094	i am really happy with this purchase.  the bracelet is the perfect size - understated but very elegant.  the packaging is very good also making it look like a quality gift
230192	these leggings are perfect for the winter time..  they feel so good. highly recommend.. the material is really stretchy but wont tear.  will be ordering another color
230196	i was so exited to order the shorts. the color is very bright. the reason why 2 stars is the fit and material. i wear size 3 in all my shorts and bermudas (fox, hurley, etc) and these were huge. falling off huge. i  am not sure if was marked the wrong size, but if fits like a 7. so i ordered a size 1, thinking it would fit like a 3. it didn't. it's slightly smaller than my size 3 shorts. i wish the material was more like the hurley shorts i own, comfy and stretchy. i will keep them tho because it was on sale. i am 5'6&#34; and 115lb.
230211	these necklace pendants are amazing. i bought them for me & my boyfriend, i've worn mine to bed, in the shower, around town & to partys. it doesn't have a single scratch on it & shines as bright as the first day i received it. its the perfect size & weight, and has a wonderful finished feel to it. the only thing i changed where the chains, i removed the pendant and put it on a self made hemp rope necklace. it still looks magnificent. anyone rating below a 5 star has not seen the brilliance in these pendants.
230232	i bought two tops, these look nice, they are long which is what i wanted and not too low in front, which for a receptionist is important.  people are looking down on you as you work, so a low front is not something i want.  the designs are pretty, the purple one is lighter than it seems in the picture more of a crushed strawberry then purple.  the green is almost lime green, so they are not as muted as they appear.
230294	this was perfect for me, and saved me a ton of money. feels and looks like the ones in store that cost $150. if i lose this one, i will come right back and buy this exact same one. they seem to run slightly small though, so i had to size up, but keeping this one for if i ever drop my holiday weight from 2010.
230302	we like to cruise on royal caribbean and the tag holders were durable...but not sized to hold the printed luggage tags.  now, that's not an issue!  just fold them on the dotted line and they slide right in.these tag holders will last for years.
230323	exactly as described, quality material, extremely affordable and as such im very pleased with my purchase and will be making more purchases in the future.
230338	very light weight and cute. long ear rings that look great with many more simple necklaces. look heavy but are super light so they can be worn all day
230345	i love these earrings, but i thought i bought a necklace and the earrings, but i got two pairs of earrings instead....
230350	i've only had the mask for a day and i already feel myself becoming one with the horse spirit inside. i've nearly caused a car accident as people have stopped in their tracks to gawk at my luxurious new mane. my neighbors are beginning to look into buying masks themselves and i hope soon to start a cult with this wonderful product. excellent service, too!
230440	love this shirt for work. i wasn't sure about the size so i ordered a m and its a little too big. i'm a size 4, so if that helps anyone. instill wear it with skinnys and tights.
230458	the toe sections are longer than my actual toes so they were not comfortable. the rest of the shoe was comfortable.
230475	im glad i purchsed this, ive read alot of.reviews and that helped me make my buying decison, i thankfully didnt get any type of smell from this bag that other reviewers.were.complaining about yay, lol. its.so soft, very comfortable as a messenger bag, i just love it!! thanks
230476	i love this 'you can't tell it's not leather' bag! it is a quality bag. soft faux leather. excellent details, like the chain emblem hanging from the zipper, zippers that actually work and what looks like designer interior. there are sections inside. this is a must for people like me who hate a bag that is just a giant hole. the shoulder strap can be extended or retracted. i was able to use it to free up my hands and use as a cross strap. when i wanted a different look, i shortened it and just used on my shoulder. for such an inexpensive bag i got my money's worth. scarleton is now my go to pocketbook choice.
230840	i didn't know what to expect when i ordered this watch, but was pleasantly surprised when i received it in the mail.  it is definitely a large face watch, but that is what i wanted and always receive compliments when i wear it.  especially from the guys!!!  :)
230852	i love this cardigan! i fit just right and the color is just what i needed to add to my wardrobe. it looks great with jeans or dress it up with a black dress or dress pants. very comfortable too.
230862	this is the smallest large i've ever seen.  my 100 pound niece couldn't fit her arm in the hole.  would not recommend for humans.
230915	i'm large breasted and 5'7&#34; so finding shirts that fit we'll is difficult. this tunic is great. it is long enough and the sleeves aren't short on me as well, which is always a problem for me. also, it fits well in the chest without looking like i'm wearing a moo moo or tent.
231027	very nice coat but i ordered a larger size then they say because of the comments. i say go 2-3d the normal size you would get because mine was still to small to ware. never the less the product is nice and would recommend it for a style no one has. my younger brother always gets asking where he got it.
231108	these jeans are very nice quality, long legs, and look amazing on, i would definitely recommendpurchasing them, i love dollhouse jeans period. all i wear. :d
231180	they sent me all different colored blue briefs with hanes in red and it said nothing about that and all the pictures showed black grey and white briefs..and that's what i wanted and expected..pretty long too..i'm 6'3-6'4 and they came to my knee pretty much..good for leg work out days at the gym tho
231245	"i discovered a little too late that a dress i'd planned on wearing to a formal event taking place in a week, was too small for me. in a panic, i searched for something under $100 that might just fit me. i stumbled across this dress and paid attention to the reviews - a lot of girls were complaining that the top was too large....which meant that it *just* might fit my obscenely large bust (well, it's not obscene...but most dresses make it look that way...!) perfect.what concerned me the most was that the dress appeared to have a ""fit-n-flare"" appearance - every dress i've ever tried on with that mermaid-esque silhouette have turned out to be a big fail for me. i have a pretty big stomach pooch...well, it came in the mail today (on time, mind you!) and what did i get? something beyond my wildest expectations. not only did it fit me perfectly, everywhere, but that broach! it's so much larger and blingier than the picture!! the zipper, as anticipated, is super flimsy, but the dress isn't skin tight on me, so i think it'll hold just fine. otherwise i would suggest that immediately upon receiving this dress, taking it to a seamstress to replace the zipper (it's only like $5 or $10...small price to pay for such an amazing dress at an amazing price)!! all this baby needs is a little steam (but i have a feeling that if you didn't have a steamer, tossing it in the dryer would be just fine) and it's good to go!!!i do wish i'd have invested in a fit-n-flare petticoat to make it flare out a little at the bottom, though... :-p"
231254	i initially bought this dress to wear for my holiday company party but will be wearing it a second time on my honeymoon cruise too!!! this dress is so lovely, i think its the sweetheart neckline.  i'm a big chested girl (38ddd), 5'8, 190lbs. so i can use to loose some pounds but at the moment i am curvacious and this dress gives me a flattering figure!!!  i got a bit of a tummy and i am happy to say that the dress hides my tummy and gives me a nice waist line!  love the purple color, its like a rich royal purple. i am really happy with my purchase!  i will be wearing a strapless only to ensure the &#34;girls&#34; stay in place (you know what i mean?!?) otherwise, the &#34;girls&#34; would be fine going without. i'm just too paranoid i'll bend over or something and they will just &#34;pop&#34; out and i'l have a peek-a-boo moment! lol  this is a lovely lovely dress!  thank you ever pretty!!!
231263	i purchased a size 10 based on the measurement chart posted on the webpage. my measurements are 41, 30, 42 and the dress fit really well. if you are more endowed up top, the dress cuts really low in the back and makes it hard to find a bra that doesn't show. the good news is that it has built in padding so you don't really need to wear a bra and still maintains a good shape.
231266	love the gown, but had to cut some of the sequins off around the zipper, they keep getting caught in zipper, causing prolbems in zipping up or down. very we'll made. fits very nice, will buy again from this company. i gave it 4 stars for the zipper prolbem. beautiful dress and fits perfect.cant wait to wear it to dinner on our cruise in march .
231269	"i am very happy with all aspects of this purchase.  as a regular size 8, this is the size i ordered and it fits perfectly.  i like the belt feature, it looks perfect against the black.  the length is perfect for me, at 5'7""  perhaps the only thing i find a little difficult is the zip - very difficult to manouvre.  i have bought a number of dresses from the seller and i am very happy with them all.  they are great for the price.  i can highly recommend."
231321	it's hard to get on and then it feels like it will fall off. the string at the back didn't help; sending back.
231416	this hat is cute as a button, and the button details are literally cute on this hat. very comfortable too.
231429	this s size is made for a toddler. i always wear size s dresses but this one was way too small,my 7yo daughter would squeeze in it ,i had no chances though. gotta go back. make sure you order 1-2 size larger than what you think you are. overall the dress looks cute,too bad i can't wear it,lol
231452	shipping was lighting fast!  they arrive about 2 days after i orderd them, which i was very surprised with-especially since it's the holiday season.  the boot are comfy and the fuzz on the inside is wonderful!  they are super cute in grey. i think that they fit true to size and don't crowd my toes as some people said they do.  my only complaint so far is that there is not much support in them and they kind of flop at the ankles when i walk.  but for the $20 that i paid for them, they are worth it!
231577	i liked the quality of this cardigan but had to return it because i ordered a medium instead of my regular small based on the reviews that said these run small. in my opinion this cardigan is true to size. i wish i would have got in in my size! the color blue was very vibrant.
231584	it was the color i wanted however the sleeves were a little too short and a little too tight leaving no room. buy one size over to be sure other wise you will be disappointed. the material it also thin if you are looking for something to go under your dress its the perfect buy that's what a used it for during this cold season
231638	went back and bought several more.. looks cute , warm and fits well, i have a normal size head i believe and bought the medium size, and am very happy, may even buy more...
231645	i like this hat, but i don't know why it is termed &#34;oversized&#34;. it fits my head in a true -to-size way, not slouchy. i was a bit disappointed because i like the scrunchy look in hats.  otherwise it is fine, and a nice light brown color.
231802	i love these booties, these are the second pair i now own. they do run a bit big, but still wearable, so i'd suggest ordering 1/2 smaller. would highly recommend to anyone. they are gorgeous, and easy to walk in!
231851	i'm a 34dd and i got the large, and it fits great.  i got it for yoga, this bra does not have what it takes to support dds during running or something else high-impact
231853	i can't say anything about the support of this bra.  i have small bust so support is never a problem.  i always look for sports bras that will give me some shape and are comfortable.  i hate tight fitting bras, and since this has hooks in three positions just like regular bras, i can adjust the fit to my liking.  also i don't have to struggle to get out of them as i can undo the hooks.  i am buying another one...
231856	lol nice shirt, the fit is great and i love it. it is thin and would be better in the fall then the winter...brrr.i know where its from and i thought as much but the wash tag was not in english. so when all eals falls i washed it in cold and lay flat to dry and it looks fine.
231962	i buy lots of items from konov and this is just as high quality as all the others.  the rope is a type of stretch rubber or something, not a chain and not leather.  just keep that in mind if you are looking for something along those lines.  the pendant is pretty nice.  good solid heavy weight and very polished and shiny.  it's a low key kind of piece but very high end looking.
232066	i purchase the yellow pair.i really like the bright color looks great with black tee.true to color and size.yes they arrived on time for the holiday weekend.thanks!
232110	this &#34;scarf&#34; is nothing more than a wide loop of jersey fabric cut free hand to the dimensions listed. it's as wide as it is long so it's very bulky around your neck and doesn't create that soft cowl neck look of most jersey infinity scarves. if you are looking for a warmer scarf and don't mind the unfinished hem (which honestly can't be seen when wearing) then you may like. it's soft, color as described. just seems like these guys went to their local fabric store and made diy scarves on the cheap. i would recommend scarfland instead.
232139	this is the perfect wallet for me. the colors help me color code which card i place where. i don't find the snap closure over the change purse an issue as some other reviewer had in the past. you  can slip in receipts in many places and i never grow tired of the beautiful colors and the qualityy of the leather. very nice.
232166	i liked these underwear, and overbought on them.  now i am having to throw them away because the elastic in the legs get loose after you wash and wear them in a couple of weeks.
232175	i'm not much of one to rave about underpants but these are very comfortable. great price for the 3 pack. they seem identicle to the pima, or more expensive 2(x)ist brief pouch, so this 3-pack is the one i prefer. i used to wear hanes and fruit of the loom, costco, and jockey, 3 packs, but never again by choice. these have no front opening (fly) but it really is not needed and the medium fits me great at about 31-33 waist, and i prefer the black. these are what i have worn for about 6 years, and these last a lot longer than the others did. amazon is a great place to buy them; at nordstrom i was paying over $12 each. my wife laughs at that small amount! i highly recommend these and will buy these again. i have about 12 now, and am now 65 years old, about 170lbs. and 6'; not much of a gut, in case you are a different size. i recommend these, will buy again, and i hope this helps someone.
232186	as i always say 2(x)ist are really attractive and sexyand they are very metrosexual , so even you hetrosexuals out there, to be stingy , girls would like to see you wearing something nice
232244	"these are pull-on stretch pants with pockets and a faux zipper placket.  they're comfortable, and held their shape for an 8 hour drive.  i wore them on vacation and didn't feel like a schlumpy tourist.i'm losing weight and transitioning between sizes fairly quickly - these were more than worth the price and i'll be checking into other wallflower products.edited to add:  at 5'8"" and 220 lbs these were a perfect fit - long enough to cover my ankles without being too long, and looked great with my faux-toms.  at 214 lbs they are starting to be a little loose, but still look nice and will be wearable for another 5 lbs or so."
232252	it's so comfortable and stretchy.i bought in size 20, but i think i could getting a size 18 because the stretch is so wonderful. i want to order another one in another color.
232256	these jeans fit great but they 'shed' like crazy, the glitter falls off and sticks to whatever you touch.  i wore these today with some knee high boots and they look great and are comfortable but the seat covers in my jeep are covered in glitter.
232283	the crystal is good, worth at least $15. with a price of $25 i expect better box and better chains.
232322	bought this as a gift for for my husband and he really likes it. he says 'finally a working-man-manly-looking shirt...' or words to that effect. i like the plaid pattern and the green/khaki color...very attractive and the material is thick and 'hefty' rather than that flimsy cotton you see nowadays. (also liked the little embroidery stitched carhartt 'c' on the pocket..very dressy for carhartt!) my husband is a marathon runner, so is on the slim side of mediums, with wider shoulders than body. it's hard to fit him with a shirt that is wide enough in the shoulders without then being too big through the body, so he wears a lot of tee-shirts! he likes a dress shirt that is a bit more narrow through the body than the square-cut, fuller boxy-body ones, and this one fit the bill...not too wide, not too narrow. he can wear it both tucked and untucked for work or casual-over-shorts, and i get to see him in something besides a tee!
232371	show-stopping purple. it feels elegant on my body. i wear my purple thigh-high boots with this. nice.thank you guys. thumbs up!
232372	i would give this five stars if the fabric was of higher quality. that said, it's a very cute dress. i live in florida and commonly wear dresses like this. i'm bringing it with me to key west in a couple weeks and it will be perfect and comfortable to wear while walking around town and dining at outdoor restaurants. to give you an idea of size: i'm 5'4&#34; and typically wear a size 6 to 8 depending on the brand. bust size is 36b. after reading the reviews thoroughly i almost went with a medium size but at the last minute decided to change it to a large. i'm so glad i did that! like other reviewers mentioned, it does fit very, very snugly in the chest. but even in a large size it is also very slimming. i was hoping more for an orangey-red but the red color i ordered is still quite beautiful...not washed out at all. (i haven't yet laundered it but i plan on washing it in cold and hanging to dry after a five minute dryer toss.)i like strapless dresses when i'm going to be out and about with extreme sun. this dress will be perfect for that. the fabric is thin but still not see-through...or at least the dress i received isn't. i do recommend this. pretty accurate depiction in the photo, i think.
232400	i bought a few different hats for the winter. the higher price one had good clips but those 13 dollars and under all had bad clips. this was the one with the worst clip. and the lowest priced. i do have had problem so i would highly caution anyone with arthritis or other hand difficulties to go for the higher priced ones if being able to attach the clip is important.it is a good warm hat. and the purple color is true to the picture.only problem is unusable clip. it seems like the part your pinch to unclip is very narrow and the part that attaches is very wide. so it is a major struggle and lots of wiggling the clip one side at a time to get the clip edges within to let go. does not need to be this way.warmest hat of all bought. velcro strap with large loop so very easy for anyone with hand problem or just don't want the strughle with bad clip. not pretty but good for the job of warmth.chaos men's dylon wool blend trapper hatsakkas unisex weatherproof nylon faux fur lined winter trooper aviator hatonly one of this brand that seems to have clip is the white. medium warmth. bought 3 of these due to lower priced and no problems with the clips of all three.
232492	this bag will be used the all seasons....the color is perfect and the style of outstanding....light weight but holds a lot.  every woman dream
232516	this top fits really nicely.  i typically really like the open sleeve or &#34;cold shoulder&#34; styling, but the  sleeves being open all the way down, they were draping a little too much and getting caught on stuff.  i actually tacked the sleeves with a small stitch in the center of the opening and like that fit better as the sleeves add a lot to the style, but being so open you barely saw them!  this way the fit stays a little closer to the arm.
232649	i have always wanted a pair of ripped leggings but was too afraid to rip a pair myself. these are a great solution! they fit amazing and look good with almost anything. when mine arrived though, they smelled of really strong plastic. it took a few washes to get the stink off, but it wasn't noticeable while wearing them.
232684	i love this stud. i wear it in my tragus and other than having to turn it to make sure it's upright a couple of times a day it is perfect. i love the size and i get a lot of compliments on it!
232706	got this for my witch costume & it's a great find.  i have not adjusted the lacings.  i am a size 14 on top & it fits just right.  recommend this!
232802	shiny, comfy, very warm, soft. i bought them for tahoe. buy a size bigger. i am m and l/xl fits me just right. lined with warm thick and soft fleece. look sexy and not bulky. great for my tahoe winter retreat. i will wear them just for walk in the snow. love them and would buy them again.
232829	these leggings are wonderful. the lining is warm but not overbearing. i can wear them in cooler weather with a tunic or longer top and heels or with boots and they are opaque (not see through) and comfortable. they do have a tendency to &#34;pill&#34; if your upper legs rub together, but that is easily removed. they wash and dry great. i do find they slide down more than just basic cotton leggings, but that is not a big deal to me.the reason this is 3 stars instead of 5 is because this seller overcharges on shipping. i ordered the 4 pack which was shipped to me in 1 flat rate envelope. i was charged as though i would receive 4 separate packages, which was over $13. i contacted the seller and was refunded 1 of the shipping charges ($4.49). the flat rate envelope costs $5 and some change. i am still waiting to hear back about who i can contact within their company to get this changed so that no one else spends almost $50 for 4 pairs of leggings and $13 of that is shipping.
232840	i haven't worn this hat very much but the crown is starting to unravel. i'll use some fabric glue on it so it won't get worse. but i would order it again.
232921	"i am age 50 and very large chested - i hate those wire bras as they constantly poke me.  but its hard to find good support.  when i purchase by band size and cup size they never seem to fit right.  these fit perfectly and the hook and eye close in the back has a padded covering to avoid digging into your back.  pretty colors, the padding is not too much and not too little - avoid ""headlights"" without having thick pads shifting around like the genie bras i tried.  great job - hope they get it in more plus sizes.  i am 47"" bust and can wear the xl or xxl of this style.+"
232943	this is one of the best bras i have tried for comfort.  i have used the similar style without the shaping and find those comfortable too.  the bit of shaping built in this one is an added bonus!
232970	it looks cool when i received it but it wasn't purchased for me so i have no clue about it..sorryyyy
233018	my daughter is 9, and usually wears size 10-12. this fit her well and should last her one more year. she loves it! the quality is great.
233022	it could not have arrived at a better time also, sooner than expected and my son had the awful stomach bug that lasted 4 days and this cheered him up (: i gave it 4 stars because it's too pricey and the sleeves are extra long like it was made for monkey arms! haha but, they are not too long to where he can't wear it, the sleeves need to be rolled up a little and bunched up. other than that it was perfect (have not washed it yet so i can not review the results after wash) it feels like it could shrink so i do not plan on putting it in the dryer at all. zipper works nicely and the minecraft logo on the zipper adds extra touch to it. i was worried on the fit because of reviews but i read none on little boys size small. i am glad i went with small instead of extra small. it is a little big on him but give him room to grow since it was so expensive he can enjoy it longer! btw my son is 4 years old, will be five in 6 months, i purchased the size small. he is your average size, small waisted but has almost outgrew his 4t pants and shirts and is wearing mostly 5t's now. he is 40 lbs.i hope this helps anyone wondering about toddler sizes. he can wear regular little boys size 4's pretty good but 4toddler sizes are too short in belly and jeans are getting too short. he is kinda in that inbetween a size 4 and 5 stage and the small fit him great (with room to grow, but not too much to where it looks way to big)
233137	i love these sneakers so much, i own them in three colors.  they are so comfortable and perfect for slipping on and off.  they are true to size and extremely comfortable.  buy them!
233146	like walking on clouds.  wide enough and roomy enough in toe box.  the regular width comfortably accommodates my somewhat wide foot and doesn't cause any distress to my bunions.  i don't see how one can go wrong with these great shoes.
233209	i loved &#34;almost&#34; everything about this shoe and travelled all over germany and france in them.  they were perfect for hotel breakfast dining, shopping and touring any mainstream tourist areas and a few that were not so mainstream.  they provide a great compromise between an athletic shoe and a slip on loafer, are extremely comfortable, and are washable.  the &#34;almost&#34; has to do with the sound they make on marble and tile floors, almost like a small suction rubber stopper being released.  my sister's shoes do not make this sound, but i have two pair that do.  despite that, i would probably buy more when these two pair wear out.
233212	they were surprisingly comfy.  i've worn them several times & like the cushioned insole a lot.  fine product. would recommend
233241	i have three pairs of these shoes in different colors. i can wear these light weight shoes all day long. my feet never ache or feel tired. once you try these shoes all other sport shoes seem so bulky and heavy.i recommend these shoes. i normally wear a size 7 but need a 7/1/2 in these.the color is really sharp too. i love them!
233319	i just received my watch, it was impressive before i even opened the case.  the watch came in a sturdy and functional case and this classy watch inside. everything seemed to indicate a product made to last.  i don't like gaudy watches and this one is big enough to see but not over done.  it has beautfiful rose gold and crystal accents, and a clear easy to read face.  with 4 straps to choose from it will go with any outfit i may have.  it was even set to the minute the right time.  overall very impressed.
233401	i have purchased several bracelets and this is truly one of my favorites. it's unique style companies with the sideways cross is gorgeous.
233413	i was a little hesitant to get this shoe because (1) i was worried that the wedge heel would look stupid and (2) i was worried that the color would be too bright. i was wrong on both accounts. the heel blends right in with the shoe, and they aren't really bright or too fluorescent. also, i took others' advice on ordering up a half size from my usual size. i'm glad i did! i usually always wear an 8 and sized up to 8.5.
233436	i ordered these socks to wear with over-the-knee and knee high boots. i am 5'10&#34; and the ribbon is just above my knee. they look great and are very soft. i haven't washed them yet, however they feel high quality. great socks! i liked them so much i bought a pair of black ones also!
233449	i love the fleece lining, it is very soft and warm.  as others have said, these are great to wear under knee high boots.  i do wish, however, that they had a reinforced heel, or were at least shaped like a sock--as they are, they are just a tube like nylons or tights.  they are stretchy enough that they don't end up bunching in front of my ankle, but that means they have to stretch more around the heel and i'm afraid that will make them wear out more quickly.
233512	"so i've recently gotten into this style (""kurti""? ""kurta""?) and the ones by this company are really really nice!! they're sooo soft and silky and comfortable to wear!!i have these tops from 2 other companies (not sure if i'm allowed to mention them so i'll leave it to you..) but although their styles are really cute, the materials they use are a bit stuffy (not sure if that means they're more authentic maybe..?)and a bit uncomfortable to wear...not that its unbearable or anything...just not used to the fabric is all..anyways, i love love the feel of the tops from/of ""maple clothing"" the most!! really soft and comfortable! very easy to wear, and looks great in both leggings and jeans :)"
233525	i bought these for parents day gift.my dad really liked these.they are comfortable and light!if anyone looking for the gift. i recommend them!
233582	i have already rely on this brand because they are the most comfy i ever wear. love this brand and would go for other brand
233628	this item was shipped very fast. the leggings are a beautiful dark navy blue color, and they are thick enough to be warm without being too bulky. i am very satisfied, and plan to buy more in other colors - definitely recommend! just got another pair of these in brown, and they are exactly like the first pair - love these leggings!
233671	was worried that this item may not fit and having to pay so much money for just one item... but when the product arrived, fell in love with the packaging... then when i opened the package, loved the feel of it. washed it before i used it of course, and was really happy with this item. very sturdy, and gives the perfect support. no lines at all were visable. went to the gym with it and really amazed with the feel and there was no riding up or bunching up. it stayed exactly where it was supposed to and really need to order another asap, just wish the cost wasn't so steep for just one underwear...
233691	i traveled internationally with this bag and it worked out great.  i like that it expands and i purchased the citron in order to easily identify it coming off the baggage carousel.  the wheels make for very easy use and i hope it will last for several more trips.
233693	these are so pretty. i bought them for my little girl but for a second i thought about keeping them for myself - that's how pretty they are! she loves them and i'm thinking of buying a pair for me!update: these ended up being a bit big for my 4 year old so i wore them instead. i originally gave these 5 stars. after wearing them for 2 weeks without taking them off i need to update my review. i noticed that they didn't sparkle quite as much as they originally did so i took them off to see if they simply needed to be cleaned. (i wore them pretty much continuously for two weeks - in the shower, while exercising, etc.) they were green. yes, green. in between the hinges and around the stones - the only thing that wasn't green was the outside gold plating. so, while they're really pretty (or, at least, they used to be) if you're the type of person who sleeps in their earrings or wears one pair for an extended period of time (a week or more) i wouldn't recommend these. if you want something to wear out for a night occasionally i suspect these would hold up for a while.
233766	the design should be good.  however, the fabric is too soft to cover my abdomen.  any bigger size is out of shape and definitely not look as good as model shown. that's why i gave only 4. but machine wash, not problem.
233805	when i wore my dress to school , everyone said that i looked beautiful! i felt beautiful too!it is cute and comfortable.
233814	i needed a new band to replace my old wedding band. my old one split in the center, and they jeweler to much to fix it. this ring was well priced and came fast.
233904	made my feet hurt just trying em on!!smells horrible and the quality is poor. design is nice if made with better matterial. soles are not cushioned at all. theres no support at all.on top the seller requested a $20 restocking fee. and for me to pay to return em.
233958	this was an unbelievably generous deal. i greedily ordered the big 4.00 carat earrings. my mistake. i have a small face and these earrings, while very nice, were just too big to be flattering on me. not a problem. i kept these but quickly ordered the smaller 2.00 carat earrings. i could never afford real diamonds. the cubic zirconia earrings in sterling silver are wonderful.
233964	i particularly like the cut, as i ride a bike a lot.  they have a high cut on the thigh, which will be great on my ride.  cool colors, like everything a/c makes.  love the junk locker - everything stays very secure.
234018	the kit is great, it comes with extra needles and everything you need. buuut i give it 3 stars because when you first get a monroe piercing done you should star off with a 16 gauge stud and ball. this comes with a 14 gauge and now the ball is embedded in my upper lip. if you get this kit buy yourself a 16 gauge ball and stud!
234029	bought one for  myself, one for my wife, so this is a duplicate review of this product, we are very pleased with product, customer service is excellent and shipping very fast/
234043	the jewels on them are coming off that's really the only thing wrong with them. eventually the jeans will look ok without them.
234100	i wear these pants for tap dance class. these pants fit very well. i'm very curvy. i find they mold to my body very nicely. they smooth me out, not cutting my circulation in any way. the material is good quality. the pants have a nice weight to them, as well as a good length. they are long enough for my 5&#34;6 frame.  i purchased a large (i wear about a 12 size in pants). i  recommend them.
234101	these are obviously made of a good quality material with sturdy construction.  however, the material is a bit thick and tightly woven, so i only wear them in cooler weather.  it is also more of a synthetic material, not like cotton.it fits true to size, very flattering and seems like it will hold its color for a very long time.
234102	can i return this thing?? its a good lint catcher that is the only positive thing i can think of to say.
234152	came in a plastic bag. no pretty gift box as shown on the pictures. looks ok. works fine so far.
234427	i have tried these on a variety of steep snowy grades, frozen creeks, and trails of packed snow.  i find packed snow to be where they gain the best traction.  they pull on easily and do not move around enough to cause a problem.  they can be easily stowed or can hang from a caribiner.
234444	as advertised and neutral colors make it easy to match with several outfits, jackets, etc. soft material and warm as well.
234482	as a collector of claddagh rings and someone who wears one every day i would highly recommend this nicely detailed comfortable to wear ring. the price for the quality of the jewelry is amazingly lower than what could ever be bought at a local jewelry store.
234531	these are super cute shoes but i just can't wear them.  the strap that goes across the toes is really stiff.  it hits my foot too low and rubs on the side of my foot.  otherwise, they would be very comfortable.
234586	i really wanted theses sandals to work because they are very cute, but naturalizer needs to actually produce wide width sandals and not just label regular width as being wide!  i've had 2 pairs recently and needed to return both because of the same problem.  i don't have super wide feet, just a basic (w).  i am giving up on naturalizer and it's a shame because they do have some really pretty sandals.  so, if you have a wide foot, look elsewhere or you will be disappointed.
234595	amazing quality, fits wonderfully, amazing price...it looks really really cute and it doesn't make the head look like a mushroom or something like other ones with the same style. love it!
234647	the color of the leaf looks nothing like the picture. it is a darker blue. i would have liked if better if it was the color that is shown on here.
234717	i loved this ring i would order a dozen more! i got so many compliments on it too. my little sister saw it and i let her try it on and she loved it too, so i let her keep it and when i went home to order it that night....it was sold out! please bring this ring back again! i'd pay more if i have to!
234721	these pierced earring in pink are beautiful and comfortable. i thoroughly enjoy the look. they arrived in padded wrapping in a small box in my mail and therefore quickly.
234826	i bought these elsewhere online for a cheaper price (with the possibility to return, not knowing how rl shoes would fit me). the style is very lovely, simple & clean (heel not too high, bonus), but the toe strap was far too tight across my toes & uncomfortably squeezed my little pinky toe - very uncomfortable when sandals or shoes do that! so i had to send them back. i wish this was available in wide sizes as well as the regular size which is too narrow for me. to me they were like shoes made for cinderella's tiny feet. i would size up 1/2 size if that gives the ankle strap a little extra room not to choke the ankle. but the tight toe strap was the sad deal breaker.
234848	i bought this with the blue toned spinner ring and often times stack them together on my middle finger.  really pretty look, and the blue color is stunning!
234854	a really nice large capacity pack.  i use it back and forth to get groceries and it's great for that.  i don't think i'd want to carry things all day in it as there are better packs for that but for my uses it's perfect and the price was great.
234855	this bag is remarkably good for the price tag.  it is made out of durable canvas that i expect should last me for years to come.  i have had my bag for about four months now. i have loaded it full of school books and a laptop and had no issues with durability.  i also filled it to the brim with clothes and some camping gear to test out it's load capacity and durability.  i took it out on the trail and performed great.( i am not recommending this bag for backpacking, but it gets the job done.)pros:-durable-rustic look-confortable-useably largecons:-button clasps(not strap buckles)-security on outside pockets(if you have small valuables put them in the hidden internal pocket.)overall a great product.
234864	of course it's not as sparkly as the picture.  not bad.. no chain though.  now i have to buy a chain and total price is adding up.  black bag it comes it should be thrown away, it is a terribly cheap mesh unlike the cloth it appears to be in the picture.  pendant is smaller than expected given the picture.
234877	it is big and sparkly, looks great and doesn't seem to be of the cheapest quality so i am happy!
234915	i wish the earrings i received would have been this color. mine were a deep navy not the cobalt/royal blue pictured
234936	very sparkly and they look exactly as pictured. (not always the case) i love studs in general but these add a great pop of color
234945	great product but what can you buy for less than $1 today? these are a perfect size great color that is bright, and help brighten any outfit. i wouldn't recommend to buy this for your wife for any occasion by itself but it makes for a nice accompaniment.
234948	i like earrings to go with every outfit and these are bright and will be noticed. they are well made and i don't think you can bet the price.  i am looking forward to wearing them.  delivery was as promised.
234950	for the price, really nice as pictured. love the basket setting. this makes a nice gift for every teen, great looks and does not break the bank. fancy enough, to wear anywhere. looks better than most.  nice size, showy but not huge. great to buy a few extra pairs makes great last min gifts. if u have a hole in your ear(s), this is a must.
235100	i have a narrow foot and i wear a size 8...by reading the reviews of others i bought an 8.5 i should have bought a size 9.  these boots are very nice but it took me three tries to get it on my foot with very thin socks.
235140	thin enough to see through if you just lay them over your hand as you would do with hosiery, (and i ordered black). not a true legging but rather, thick plasticized tights.this fabric might have started out as cotton but it is toxic chinese soup now. horrid chemical smell that will affect breathing when you open package. smell does not lessen upon washing. if you wouldn't subject your skin (your largest organ), to being slathered with petroleum, then you wouldn't want to don these either.
235158	these leggings are the right color and style, the fit however, not so much. maybe i shouldn't wear leggings but these were super tight. i got the largest size possible and they still were sliding off all night. you can see through them, the material is super cheap. they weren't very expensive which is the only reason i gave them a three. i suggest cinching the waist or something, but maybe not worth the effort.
235168	the stretch cotton feels comfortable. very form fitting and relaxed. i like how it looks on my legs. very cute.
235189	great quality for the price. the pagage arrived very quickly. they fit great and comfotable enough to go shopping in and work.
235198	its sometimes a gamble buying shoes and clothes online but these are true to size for sure!  and the quality for the price is great.  i will definitely order from them again and recommend this seller.
235422	i have purchased injinji socks in the past.  they have great customer support (had a pair go bad, they replaced with two pairs), great quality products, and are very comfortable.  these socks, however, seem to run tight compared to their other styles.  i purchased these to wear with my sperrys and they do not show! that is exactly what i wanted.  i am ordering next size up for my next pair though.  these are listed to a 10, i wear 10
235511	the colors and design of the bodysuits are very nice. the fabric is thicker than other brands and seems durable. i always like bodysuits made by carter's because they seem to last longer.
235523	don't bother buying this. it fell apart the 1st day i wore it! it was shiny enough but for the price i should have known.
235537	arrived on time and in good shape.  i bought this for building a charm bracelet for my mom.  it is a very pretty bracelet on it's own but will look even better when i finish the charm bracelet.  love the variety that amazon carries.  would recommend to anyone, especially those looking for a bracelet to turn into a charm bracelet.
235554	this arrived very quickly.  it is very soft and a nice size.  i stand in the cold waiting for the train at 6am so it really comes in handy.
235661	"this scarf is a versatile piece to include in your wardrobe. as stated by other reviewers, the colors are darker than pictured, but the metallic thread gives it some sparkle. ""sea breeze"" makes me think of shades of blue and green, but the color that pops is burgundy. i would wear this scarf with shades of blue, burgundy, pink, purple, grey, and cream/oatmeal.  i paired it with a pale pink top to give it a more seasonal look for spring. the woven fabric is a medium weight, perfect for spring or fall. whether this style scarf is called infinity, eternity, or circular, it is an effortless way to add interest to an outfit."
235681	looks like the picture, however its super sheer so white underwear and bra/tube top are necessary. im 4'11 115 lbs and this dress comes to my knees. kinda wish it was a little shorter on me. itll be nice as an easter dress :)
235708	this company always ships on time for ahead of schedule. yes the clothes run small but they alert you ahead of time and the prices are so cheap! i always order from this company and they have great customer service. super cute dress that on me, fits like a tunic since i am not as small as the model but i expected that and am very happy with the product, as always.
235721	this shirt is super cute and its long enough to wear as a dress with sweater stockings. the fit is great. i bought my actual size and even if i lose more weight, this will still look really nice. i order from this company all the time and i'm happy evry time.
235724	its super cute and trendy, but i ordered an extra large and usually i order a large with allegra and its a little big, so i was good with getting an xl, for this fitting dress, but its a little snug, so i wear it as a long top over jeans and its adorable!!
235783	i wear a 7 1/2 and ordered a 7...perfect. they are plenty wide too.  they are feather light , perfect for so cal winter. i sprayed it with a waterproofer for shoes, definitely good to go now!
235914	these are extremely comfortable and fit well - i normally wear a size 8 but i ordered 8.5 to be on the safe size and i think that was a good call. when i wear these, a lot of people call them &#34;toms&#34; - i'm a pretty destitute grad student and normally don't wear fashionable items so its kind of cool to trick people into thinking i have some kind of fashion sense. the only downside to these is now that its getting colder, i can't really wear them because apparently a lot of heat escapes through that top part of your foot that is exposed with these shoes! still, really cute and they go with everything.
235967	these things stay attached to your jeans.  they are a little on the short side, so its best used for jeans that are a skosh long.  i now look sporty and fabulous in my little black boots.
236021	attractive but broke easily. the chain around the finger snapped quite easily. we fixed it with our jewelry skills, but it shouldn't have broken as it did.
236054	i read other reviews and purchased a large for my 5'5 135lb frame.  it fits great and hugs my curves in a flattering way.  i've been looking for a white shirt like this, but this, sadly is completely see through.  i'm going to wear it with a t-shirt over-top.  i would happily buy this shirt in any color except white.
236216	this is lovely ..it does run a bit small im a 12-14 36dd.  to much larger the xxl will be to small. i am mid section heavy that area was fine. its was mostly the bust. the skirt was plenty big enough!
236218	so frustrated. i ordered an extra large, i normally wear a size 11 so i figured it should work... ladies the extra large... is like a size 5... and we all know what it feel like to try to put some that is 6 sizes to small  for us is like... normally this act is not attempt... lol... sadly it is very adorable, and now all i can do see stare at it, truthfully if that is what an extra large is this days... i must be morbidly obese to the world... smh... anyway, with no plan to look ill for my body frame... i have no plan to do an extreme diet for this..  have fun with this size 5 and under, but make sure you order an extra large.. i fear the large and medium may be size 0 :(...
236227	i was going for a cami that i could comfortably wear either as layering under other shirts, by itself under an open blazer or just by itself. and i needed it to be long enough that it would cover my entire torso and not roll up (i'm 5'9&#34;, so i often run into camis that are too short).unfortunately, these camis did not work for me.the fabric is really thin, really clingy and the camis themselves run small, which meant the fabric clung to every single bump and roll like it was painted on me. also, i could see almost completely through the fabric. to be fair, though, i was trying on a gold colored one, so maybe the darker ones are more opaque...however i don't want to have to live in dark colors just to have some semblance of modesty.on the plus side, they didn't feel super cheap like some camisoles do, the straps seemed sturdy even though they were light and thin and the length was long enough to reach past my waist. also, the shape of the neckline was flattering.so to summarize, great for layering under other shirts, but not much else...unless you like showing off your body and underwear a lot, that is.
236241	this attractive top provides just the right amount of coverage with the perfect comfort of soft material and easy fit.
236255	i like the see through fashions that are out now but i don't have a see through friendly body.  luckily this hides what needs hiding while letting me wear a cool fashion.
236257	this is nice and it fits the way i like it. i will be buying more of these in the future.
236354	just love these, i have 3 pierceings and have just had one done on the other year so i can wear my fav earrings. just love these.
236413	these socks are nice and warm, extremely thick and comfortable.  the only complaint i have is that they don't stay in place and shift around in your shoes or boots.  i bought several pairs of carhartt socks in different styles (but all the same length and thickness) and they all have the same problem.  i tried socks from thorlo that were similar but  still held their shape and didn't shift. so, if have shifty socks is going to drive you nuts, i'd go with the thorlos.
236444	though the sizing is accurate, the color received is not accurate to the photo. just beware of that. i purchase the lagoon and it's more of a light green color.
236452	i get so many complements when i wear this ring. if you are the fence about ordering this ring ~ go ahead and purchase it. you will not be disappointed.
236507	this is my first pair of aerosole sandals and i really love them.  i normally buy yellow box thongs because the bed is so soft but these are amazing also.  very soft and comfortable and great for my upcoming beach trip. i wear a 7 1/2 and i ordered a 7 1/2 and they fit perfectly.
236556	i got this as a gift for my friend who loves skull's.. it is great quality. the leather is nice and the skulls are big and chunky and look super cool. they twist so you can have them all the same or do your own thing. my friend is a girl and i thought for sure that since it was adjustable it wouldn't be too big.. it is much bigger than i thought and for it to fit her wrist we needed to take a link out. we have a friend who makes jewelry so we have taken it to her to make it smaller.. she loved it even though it was too big. she is just glad that she can still rock it and all we had to do was take a link out.. perfect size for a man!! if you are a woman and want to get this keep in mind who you might know that can help you take a link out.. also might be way too big for a smaller child..all in all i gave it 4 stars just because of it being much to large and had to take a link out otherwise i would have given it a 5..
236559	from what i've been told they are very warm, and loose fitting like normal socks. not super tight like some novelty socks are.
236564	good price, cute socks, hides hairy legs. you think i'm joking, but no. teen daughter says no shaving, she's not out to impress anyone, and she wears these instead. i'm stealing her idea. watch out, world.
236565	they go all the way my thighs like i wanted them too, and don't ride down. they're not too tight and don't cut into my skin.
236652	accurate sizing, good quality. the way they priced the item was a bit misleading. the shipping charges are a bit inflated to compensate for the cheap listed price. that being said it was still a decent price for a nice sturdy band.
236656	i ordered up a size because i wanted it to fit like the model.  i should have just ordered my original size.  however,  it is such a fun, comfy shirt i wear it alot.  i just have to roll the sleeves because they are long.  super cute and goes with a lot.
236657	i could have ordered a medium and it would have still been baggie enough. the large is great though! i'm 5'5 145. goes great with leggings
236661	i love this seller's clothes, they fit as stated.  this shirt is an oversize.  i order extra large but, i could have used large.
236666	as some of the other reviews said, it looks like it's a sweatshirt material but it's not.  it's much thinner but because i read the review before i bought it, i was expecting it and it works just fine for me.  i really love this shirt, so cute!
236689	it's not bad but is wide i mean i will wear it to run to the store. with a turtle neck under
236695	first i'm a size 12 and it was large on me, second it's well made and if it came in other colors i would purchase more than one!! very light so not for winter more for fall wear..
236697	i got this way before scheduled. product arrived wrinkled but after washing and drying wrinkles were gone and i love it. it's warm, cute, flattering and versatile. yes, i would recommend this product. ill post pictures once i actually wear it out.
236736	very comfy top. i wanted a loose top for traveling that was good in cool or warm weather without having to deal with a jacket...this did great. i am very pleased with this purchase.
236938	i'm normally a boxer brief guy until i realized how silly the concept is. the boxer briefs were made for guys to feel cooler than wearing tighty whities and not having regular boxers bunching up in their pants. the boxer briefs have been riding up when i'm wearing pants or working out. these will do the job they did but without the bunching at the crotch. i probably should have gone with a medium though. small was for 30-32&#34; and medium said 34-36&#34; or something. i'm a 33&#34; waist and got small. they fit a tiny bit tight, but are comfy. but if they shrink after washing i may have to get mediums.
236964	because the rise on the shorts is so high, quite a ways up on my belly, they're a bit uncomfortable and less easy when at a urinal.
237002	seems men's briefs are becoming impossible to find and when you do they are made horrible. until i found these i was just giving up on finding anything worth buying. boxer briefs are to hot and normal briefs if you find any are made way to small. these men's hanes classics are the best briefs i have ever wore. they are soft and comfortable and light.they fit perfectly in every way. not to tight and not to loose. they support just as they should and so light and soft it is almost like not wearing anything.....these are perfect.
237006	these sports briefs are both comfortable and stylish. they are made from 100% cotton that feels so comfortably soft.  the 'breathable' cotton material is cool and absorbent, keeping me comfortable even after a light gym workout!these sports briefs are sold in packs of 7.  each pack has an even assortment of dark and light solid colors, as well as a couple of 'sexy' stripes! ... that's how i was advised to describe these stripe sports briefs!!! :)just a tip: if you generally purchase men's boxers, you need to note that the sizing is smaller for men's briefs & boxer briefs.  for example:  in men's boxers, medium (m) size is 34 - 36 while in men's briefs & boxer briefs, medium (m) size is 32 - 34.check around on amazon for the best price on these classic 100% cotton briefs.definitely 5 stars for these all cotton hanes briefs!hope my review was helpful ... jeffrey a. (jeff)
237135	ordered a small because they listed the size as 30-32 under the mens boxers section but apparently these are sized to the boxer briefs size chart even though they are titled boxers which makes them a small at 28-30. they are slightly big so i kept them instead of hassling with returns.
237229	i have been wearing cuddle duds for twenty years and had no idea something this great was available.i am ordering another one asap.this is the nicestfleece lined top i've ever had.
237305	for the price they should give a coupleof extras for the ones thatpop  out clifford ihace bought ten colors mostly for the golf shoes they give a comfort in its elasticity but some come out & when it is overstreched it like a wet noodle cliff
237334	"this watch is great! for the cheap price i paid, i wasn't expecting much but when it arrived i was rather pleased. it has a tough ""leather"" band and it looks elegant not cheap. highly recommend."
237408	"i have an o'neill rash guard that's way too baggy for serious swimming. it fits like a t-shirt and drags you down so i was looking for a rash guard that is form fitting. the quiksilver all time rash guard is exactly that. it's perfect for working out. it's almost skin tight which is what you need if you're doing laps. i'm 145 lbs. and 5'9"" and the medium fits great although i might have been able to get into a small. it looks great paired with jammers and i highly recommend going with a dark color to avoid yellowing."
237429	i am pleased with this purchase. decent appearance and quality of beads. good value for the money. will make nice filler beads for any bracelet. a couple of beads had a substance which was like wax or plastic on them which needed to be removed for a shiner finish. good for any starter bracelet.
237470	i contemplated for some time as to what size to order.  i wish i would have chosen one size smaller, but according to the size chart this should have been the one.  i will not return it, since it still fits comfortably enough for beachwear.  i love the length of the skirt.  it is long enough to walk around comfortably and not feel like my rear end is hanging out.  would definitely recommend this suit.
237472	i finally got to use my suit. i love it. it is really soft inside. fits just right. it is a little bit longer (skirt) then other suits i have had but i would buy another one for sure.
237475	usually i'm a size 12.  the size 12s fit way too small in this boot.  returned and ordered a size 12 in the bugaboot ii which was said to fit true.  the size 12s in the bugaboot ii fit nicely.
237526	the product arrived on time and the shade and texture make it so versatile. great bargain, i got it in two others colors as well
237559	was looking for a lighter color jean from southpole and these are perfect. love them and i am very tall and southpole always has a very long inseam compared to what is stated, so i just get the right waist size and i know the inseam will be perfect.
237630	i usually wear a 7.5 and have pretty narrow feet.  these fit great!  i'm 5'1&#34; and these come up a little under knee high.
237677	these shorts are a perfect length for the older woman.  love the color--happy color.  fit is right for size 8.  quality weight fabric.
237772	really cute swimsuit, it does fit a little small though so you might want to take this into consideration when ordering and go up a size. i wen't up one size on mine and it fits perfectly.
237862	i've previously owned a asics men's gel-nimbus 12 running shoe and from then i was hooked on the gel-nimbus line and with the asics men's gel-nimbus 15 lite-show running shoe will continue the same trend. the 12s were durable and lasted a while and from instantly wearing these 15s you know it will stand up to the same elements and treatment.the shoe is light in weight and provides a comfortable support to your feet from walking to jogging to running. the reflective material really stands out in the night but then again don't expect it to scream &#34;watch out&#34; at someone....as some amount of common sense is still required to cross busy streets and intersections and the often look over the shoulder when running in poorly lit areas.definitely will recommend this to someone who is willing to invest in quality footwear once cost is not a problem.
237895	hugs feet well.  i had back and knee surgeries so i needed shoes that can handle the hard pavement.  well cushioned and absorbs pavement shock.  it may be too soft for some.  these have the most cushioning of any shoe i've ever owned.  i usually had shoes in the nike air family.  i also have asics gel racers that are on the opposite end of the cumulus.  great for heel strikers and people with sore joints.
237927	i was so excited to get my new pair of asics, but alas, it's not for my foot. i wore it one hour around the house and my feet felt like they're burning. i have:high archwide toe-boxi thought this shoe with its plentiful cushioning would be right, but i wouldn't take a chance on something that hurts after a half hour, so i sent them back. i'm sure the shoe would make plenty of other feet happy though :-} it's quite cute looking. more pink than i expected from the picture, but very stylish that way.
238129	these are a very good imitation of silk, but run large. you may need to order a size smaller than usual.
238182	it is just what i wanted, i don't like the huge jackets that make you look bigger... the mighty lite is perfect, elegant and warm!
238204	i like this-it's a bit snug in the bust area so if you are ample-be careful in the size you order.it is comfortable albeit a bit snug. looks great with whatever i were it with or under.if you don't tuck it in you will have that &#34;pregnant&#34; shirt look-mine isn't to bad as it is a snug fit.nice.
238206	"the reason i put ""tee"" in quotes is because this is more tank than tee. i adore this shirt. i am 36b 108 lbs 5'2"" and ordered the medium, to give some perspective. the medium fits snugly (but not overly tight) in the bust and very swingy/loose everywhere else. what i love about it is the material, which is super soft and flowy. i ordered the grey color. while the description says ""cotton"" it's 65% poly and 35% cotton. in my experience, blends work better for tee shirts, so this was not a disappointment for me. i know it will wash very well and stay nice for a long time (as long as it is air-dried). i also like that there is no cleavage and no bra showing; the neckline is high enough to guarantee this but not annoyingly high. this makes this shirt very wearable and i can just tell i will be going to it again and again just because it's so practical. i know lots of women do not find the rounded bottom flattering but i've always liked that look - i feel it adds a touch of femininity and pizzazz to an otherwise ho-hum top. i will be purchasing more, although the color selection is not really my style. i'd love to see this shirt in a brown, cream, olive green, and yellow.*eta i also ordered this in white, and it is 100% cotton! i guess it's not all that strange that different colors use different materials, just odd that it's not in the item description. i am actually a tad disappointed in all-cotton as it doesn't hang as nicely as the blend, but whatevs."
238276	bought it as the perfect slouchy hat but then to find out that my fav animal, a penguin, was part of the label just made it 10x better. so warm and comfy!!
238290	i'll be honest, i didn't actually expect very much from a pair of shoes i bought online without trying them on first. i've tried a few different shoes from different sites before, and was always extremely disappointed. these, however, are awesome! they're super cute and look way fancier than a wedge sneaker which is always nice. i was so delighted by them when they arrived that i actually wore them with a dress to a wedding that weekend. i got tons of compliments on them! great quality, only thing i would say is the laces *are* comically long, so either tuck them in or have another pair handy. i will probably buy the tan version of these because i enjoy them so much.
238314	i ordered these to wear to a wedding and they were super comfortable and looked cute with my dress. i don't normally like the look of flats with a dress but these look so vintage. i wear a 6.5 and ordered a 7, perfect fit. i plan to order the tan and the orange as soon as they are back in stock! my foot is somewhat wide but these did not pinch the way most ballet flats do until you get them broken in. i danced all night in them and my feet weren't even sore. the shipping is pretty fast, they arrived before the estimated delivery.
238341	runs a little big but doesn't shrink too much after washing. great bright color. my daughter wears it all..the...time lol.
238386	these boots look and fit great.  they don't lace up super tight so they work better over skinny pants or leggings than under regular pants.  the only reason i didn't give them five stars is because the material is fair quality but not great.  i don't expect they'll hold up over years of wear and tear.  however, the price is good so if i need to replace them later on it's not a big deal.
238472	love the zippers!  they are great!  these do shrink.  baby is wearing these as a newborn (6lbs 3oz, 1 week old).  get the right size and you'll be set!!!
238492	when i saw the price of these, i was kind of skeptical-- even though they're from a reputable brand. however, when i opened the package, i love them. the set of two is so cute and when i saw them on my godson i knew i had made the right choice.
238513	you can never have enough sleepers for an infant!  these fit great and wash very nicely.  i like the zip versus the snaps.
238588	ordered a size small and for my size 34a it was comfortable.  perfect fit and not tight to where it feels constricted.  can't wait to order in more colors.
238608	i used to have to worry about chaffing from sports bras.  i used to have to put sports glide stuff on if i was going to run more than 3 miles.  not any more!  my husband bought me a champion bra as a xmas present last year.  i immediately fell in love with it!  i now have one in black, red, purple, blue.  i needed an orange one for a nemo costume but their orange one is too dark.  i'll soon have a white one too.  there is no seam so there is no reason to chafe!  the fit is fabulous and their are super comfy while still holding the girls in place.  i highly recommend these bras!
238640	omg! this bra doesn't hold your ladies, it smashes them! in a few words: the most uncomfortable sport-bra ever. i couldn't even breath on it. i did order a size up, but apparently it wasn't enough. usually, i am a xxsp so, it rarely happens that i find something that it's too small - well, not in this case. i order an xs and i couldn't move. i almost turned purple. ahahah further, i didn't like the fit at all. i purchased the white one which was kind of see-through. additionally, this is that kind of bra that shows your nipples if you have that issue.  sorry: thumbs down!
238693	this fits very nicely and is really comfortable.  i usually wear a small or medium, and the medium fits well.  very attractive casual top for wearing around or working out.  like the contrast stitching.  also is high enough in front that you could do yoga or exercise and not worry about the top sliding down.  bought 2 of these and may buy a third in a different color.
238729	dress arrived very quickly. quality of fabric very nice. 14 year old granddaughter was very pleased with dress. she will wear for dressy occasions and sundays. the length and the swing of the skirt w/mary jane 2 inch heeled pump made her look like a movie star. she immediately picked two more dresses for me to order. glad i found lindy bop!
238732	the dress is very pretty and seems well made as many have said it does run small. i however didnt care for the material it was mad out of it feels very cheap polyester and it has a bit of shine to it
238807	you're taking a risk here. the blouse you receive may not be the one other reviewers are talking about, and the seller can't accept returns because they are so far  away. they did offer me a refund, so i'm waiting for that, but i'm baffled and wish i could include a  pic here, because this blouse is quite lopsided. very high, shows my belly, on right front side, but long on right left side. not a fashion thing, clearly a mistake, which really makes me sad about who might have potentially sewn this... i actually feel bad writing this review, but it had to be said.
238891	i bought this for my 8 year old.  he is very big for his age so i bought the large one but it was too long.
238989	i love this bag & manager to get my stuff in it but wish it was just another inch bigger.
238996	i have a myriad of baggallini bags now, so i have begun to use them for serving different functions.  i own the plaza mini in forest (i think the interior color is called mimosa - it's a medium[ish]-dark yellow).  it's a clean color - doesn't look dull.  i think i would love this bag in black for dressing up and going out on the town.  i use the green one as a pencil bag to carry school essentials (pens, pencils, eraser, notecards, headphones, digital remote for lecture participation, etc.).  i personally think the little handle is cute.  i don't use the shoulder strap, but did notice that it's made of a lighter material than other baggalini shoulder straps.  this is one of the few baggallinis that still has the button snap over the very back pocket - it annoys me, because i'm afraid the metal snap button will crack the screen of my iphone if i want to put it back there.  no big deal though; most people seem to appreciate the snap button, and don't like it when it's not there.  i wanted to buy this one in more colors, but this bag is expensive for a small baggallini...deduction of one star for price.  otherwise, a feminine adorable bag that serves me well.  it has a smooth design that slips surprisingly easily into my backpack when it's almost full.  i have yet to purchase a baggallini that i don't love. :)
239022	these boots are amazing. super comfortable. i think they look exactly like the picture so it was exactly what i wanted. as many of the previous reviews stated, these boots are a bit wider than your standard shoe sizing. for me, that was perfect. i have wider feet. they are probably a bit larger than your average shoe size as well, but i&#8217;ve found that with a thick winter sock underneath, they fit perfectly. they are the perfect mix of functional and cute!
239104	i wear a size 32, bought a size 32, fits perfectly.these board shorts are very bright and are quite the attention getter.due to no lining, they dry very quickly. love them. hurley knows how to make boardshorts.
239114	i saw these at my local department store, but they didn't have my size so i ordered them via amazon.. they look like nice dress/golf shorts, but feel like board shorts.. which is great - very breathable, lightweight material.
239291	this wrap style hoodie is made of french terry fabric which is not too heavy, but enough to act as a light jacket.  the belt is sewn to the jacket in the back which prevents it from shifting around or getting lost or riding up. it's longer, covers your butt. the sleeves are quite long and look cute rolled up a bit. i bought one in navy and charcoal. i love them!!!  they are so much more polished than a sweatshirt yet still super-comfy. note: this hoodie runs small!  i usually wear an 8-10 in jeans, size 10 in blazers, but the extra-large in this hoodie fits me perfectly...so definitely go up a size or even 2 for a more comfortable fit.
239417	these shorts are perfect for what i was looking for: a casual short to walk the dog, or hang around the house, or just run over to the convenient store. they are super comfortable and i love that they have pockets. will probably be getting the black pair too before long. highly recommend.
239427	these are very cute pattern and very soft material but im 5'2 and 110 lbs skinny but i got a big butt and the first time i wore them i ripped up the crotch. these are for small girls and definately not if you got curves i had to sew them back but i still love them. they are really really soft and the pattern is super cute, but they are for small skinny girls. i thought that was me but i guess not. definately for girls not women very very cute though i wish they fit me a little better
239445	love these.  i am 5'5&#34;, 150 lbs, these fit great and ive got lots of compliments.  cant beat the price :)
239623	i reviewed this before i believe, and it is pretty, but a whole lot smaller and less impressive than it looks in screen.  i found antique gold earrings online that would match nicely, but they are unavailable right now.ok but not as good as i hoped.
239624	its very cheap but cute. some of the flowers were facing the wrong direction but i had it fixed. if you are really rough or tend to tug on jewelry i don't recommend this
239659	i have bought and returned 3 pairs of boots now on amazon (thank god for free returns!).  i have a pair of slippers by keen and they are very comfy.  so when i saw they made boots i decided to give them a try.  i am keeping these even though they are a tad bit big.they are comfy on there on but i have plantar fasciitis and wear custom orthotics.  these accommodate my orthotics with room still available.  i do wear winter socks but with these boots i could even wear thicker socks.  today the high was 20 degrees with lots of snow and ice.  this was the first time my toes were not freezing half way through walking the dog!  they do not provide ankle support so these wouldn't be ideal for long hikes but for everyday walking the dog even in the parks (off road) they will serve its purpose.they are very stylish so i feel like i could wear these anywhere.  i am not a small girl (5'10&#34; 220lbs) and had no problem zipping these up my calves with my jeans tucked in!
239689	i got these a size up from what i would normally buy based on other reviews i read. they fit just fine. no chance to try in the water yet. they look good on. they seem hit a little lower than i would normally but still are flattering.
239692	i bought a pair of these in an xl to replace a tankini bottom that was too skimpy. i was nervous because they didn't have a sizing chart, so i was pleasantly surprised when it fit the way i expected. normally i wear a 16, but rounded up to an 18 for swimwear. it's not too snug and not too loose, hits just below the navel, doesn't create rolls over the top, and offers about as much control as an average swim bottom. there's actually enough give in these that i could have ordered a size down and still had it fit (especially if i wanted more control). if it helps, even though the ordering page calls it an xl/18, the tag that came on it has it listed as size 46-48. as for the quality, it has two layers, no loose seams, and kept its shape & color after a full day in a chlorinated pool, full wash, and gentle cycle dry.
239705	really comfortable, no itchy seams, breathable. i ordered a 3xl and received a 2xl, which is actually still slightly too large for me at 52&#34;chest/38&#34;waist. i have other 2xl under armor shirts (not baselayers) which are much tighter than this. beware of funky sizing.
239849	the ring was not misrepresented, but it just doesn't draw the eye the way i anticipated. it runs slightly smaller than standard for ring sizing, but not a full size smaller.  for some of us it is the difference in comfort or which hand/finger it can be worn on. the rose gold finish is a bit more coppery than some rose gold (finish) rings, but not so much that most would be put off by it; will probably be worn mostly in situations that i still want to wear jewelry, but that wearing jewelry that i was concerned about losing would be an issue. (i.e. hospital, swimming...). someone just building a jewelry wardrobe would probably enjoy this.
239915	it fits great and has a slimming effect.  i wish the straps were adjustable (i have narrow shoulders) but otherwise i love it!!
239941	they are even more comfortable then i expected.  no complaints.  i will soon buy another pair of nike's in a different color.
239999	i love these shoes so much. they fit perfect, and are easy to walk in. i would reccomend these to everyone.
240076	i purchased 2 of these and the globe on one was upside down!  thankfully i could bend the holder to remove the sphere and turn it around.  the paint lines of the blue are a little sloppy but otherwise, for the price, it's a good item!
240087	given as gifts. very pretty. sized proportionate to photo. great for the price, and doesn't seem like it will break too quickly.
240097	material is smooth and comfortable. other than wearing it for the beaches, it could be a good travel clothing to pack in as it is lightweight.
240161	pretty caftan in vibrant color, nice material, very soft.  suitable for lounding.  i like it because i needed something like this for my lounging at home after a long day outside.  thanks for the fashionable and pretty caftan.
240199	these shoes are sooo sexy and quite comfortable. they arrived quickly and feel soft on the outside. the only downfall is the stitching looks a little unprofessional up close, but who the heck will be that close to your shoes anyway? overall great buy!
240202	loves, loves loves these wedges, i was so happy when they arrived. the shoe looks just s it does in the picture, they are very comfortable i wore all night with no issues, no stumbles, no balancing act and no pain :) they add height but not too much and they look great with jeans or your favorite summer dress. i will definitely be getting many wears out of these and maybe order another color :)
240230	i gave this shoe a 2 star rating for cuteness,i knew the shoe ran about 2 sizes too small but they were so cute and matched what i needed them for. i'm normally a size 9 1/2 so i always get a 10 in wedges for comfort. this shoe strangled my feet. within 10 minutes out the door i was miserable. i forced a smile the 5 times i was complimented on them but they will sit on display in my walkin closet for one of my tiny foot friends to borrow.
240401	i love these shoes. the color is arresting and they are surprisingly comfortable to wear. they are very flattering and sexy. my friend made the comment above. nice!
240416	i am very happy with my purchase. i have always worn saucony shoes when running, or working out. these have not failed to deliver. i have also found that regardless of weather i pay $150 for a pair of shoes or a good deal like this, they last about the same amount of time. i am rather hard on my shoes and put an average of about 40 miles a week on them. these are holding up well.and amazon always has the best price!!
240425	again....i bought a size m and it ran like a size xtra large.  way too big for me but i will keep it for my fater in law.  i got a great deal on it so it's a keeper.
240433	i couldn't believe the detail on this ring for the price they wanted. this ring is a steal at the price.
240464	great looking scarf, not overstated or bright, in fact color is just a little off from picture, a little more suttle.
240519	these shoes fit me as expected with a sleek look, but they are not leather as described! the label inside the shoe says:upper: other materials/syntheticlining: textilesole: rubberdisappointing, but i already wore them and like the look enough to keep them. just be forewarned!
240546	i love this precious little ring just precious and i received it very quickly thank you it is a sweet addition to my collection much love and jesus bless you from florida
240622	i was looking for a plain black sneaker that didn't look like a space ship and i have found them. .some of the other sneaks look as if they were designed by an aeronautical engineer turned cup cake manufacturer. not these, they are black on black on black soles. cool
240633	"for a shoe this substantial (and touted by every running magazine as super-luxurious!), i expected more cushioning. i also own the asics nimbus 15 and the saucony ride 6, which are about the same weight, but seem far more cushioned and ""pillowy"" than the glycerin.  i'm ok with a ""weighty"" shoe, but it better be worth the extra ounces, and the glycerin just isn't worth the weight for me.  i am a true neutral runner, but something about these shoes caused me to pronate and get sore knees after each run (perhaps it's the stiffness or lack of forefoot padding?)  overall, i'm having a hard time even categorizing these shoes, but i guess it doesn't matter, because in the end - they were just average for me."
240677	i ordered this, but my husband was very skeptical about the quality of a stainless steel ring with all these artificial stones on it -- so, when it arrived, he was very pleasantly surprised at how shiny and lovely it looked. now to see how well it holds up to long-term daily wear.
240699	item arrived on time but was brown braided leather & the stainless steel looked unlike any i've ever seen....very cheap.  not pleased with this purchase.
240721	pros:excellent band fit and holdbecause of elastic inside the edges of the band, it stays put against your skinsoft straps do not cut into the skinstraps are elastic even on the adjustable parts, so they stretch even when pulled to maximum tightnessunique under wire shape makes for great support in the cupnot expensive for a quality bracons:straps are elastic even on the adjustable parts, so they stretch even when pulled to maximum tightness. this can be good if that maximum tightness is enough for you, and good for your shoulders, because the stretchiness doesn't cut into your shoulder. but if you're like me, and the stretchiness feels a bit loose or doesn't hold the cup upright enough, then this is bad.the deep cut of the cups caused &#34;spillage&#34; after a couple of hours. now, this could have been because i needed a larger size in this bra, or because of the shape of my breasts. my mom has this same bra (in a smaller size, 38 c) and does not have this problem, so i am thinking that it may be my own fault, but i ordered a 44 ddd and i frankly have never had to order a size larger than that, and i don't know what size comes next, without being too big. however, it may be a potential problem when ordering, so if you're uncertain, try ordering a cup size up. the band size is perfect, so don't change it.in summary, this is a really good bra, for under $30, and if you have prime, it's a definite bargain. you won't be disappointed. try it on when you get to to ensure that the cup is a good fit, because it's a deep plunge bra, the cup size you're used to may need adjusting. i will definitely buy this one again.also, i notice some people had trouble getting it on due to the &#34;stay put&#34; rubber on the inside. this is only a problem because people have different methods of putting bras on. personally, i put the bra on wrong side up (with the cups facing down resting on my abdomen, and the tag hanging out), and fasten the back bands in the front, then turn it around and place  the cups over my breasts and pull on the shoulder straps. doing it this way, i had no more difficulty than i do with any other (lesser quality) bra. always make sure you are completely dried off before putting on your undergarments, no matter what kind they are. (clothing against wet skin and under more clothing can cause your skin to break down and can be a medium for growing fungal infections, like yeast, on your skin, in addition to making it difficult to slide clothes on)i hope this helps!
240748	really big. too big for me but it is beautiful and made well. the camel i purchased is very 'orange' so be prepared if you don't like the hue. still it is a beautiful bag and i love all the storage areas.
240792	i bought this to wear under other shirts that are a bit too low cut or too sheer. obviously it can't be worn under something that is completely sheer but it works under a thin white sweater that i have. sizing runs a tad small but i think these are sized to juniors sizes. i wear 38dd & size 22 jeans and fit well into a 3x. would definitely recommend to a friend & am planning on buying several more in other colors!
240839	this is a light sweater, perfect for fall or sitting inside on colder days and relaxing (with all of your cats :) )it's cute and comfy and the sleeves are the perfect fit.  since this comes from china the sizing is smaller than american sizing.  i ordered a large and it fit me like a medium would and i'm 5'0'' and 110lbs.  just to be safe try one size up or measure yourself according to the sizing info on the product page.
240855	not what i expected, material is very thin, thought the top was going to be padded, (b/c that something that i really needed. but other than that, i liked it.
240874	i mainly bought these shoes because they were fun colors and cheap. i've bought reebok years ago and liked them. initially they were of great comfort and they felt great to walk around in. however, they're definitely not made to workout in, as i am a runner and workout regularly. i've never had problems with any of my other shoes, but these in specific made my feel extremely hot and uncomfortable. they also had no support as needed for when i was running so my feet hurt a lot. wish i would have just spent the money on a real pair of running shoes. i use these for running to the store or short walks. that's about as good as it gets for these... quite disappointed..
240904	these boots came fairly quickly and before the expected delivery date. they're exactly as pictured. they're extremely adorable and i wear mine all the time. i went up half a size and they fit pretty well. although if you stayed true to your size youd probably be fine too. definitely a good buy.
240906	i purchased these for my daughters birthday and she loved them. very nice quality for the money.  they were packaged very good and delivered as stated.  very nice looking boot!
240935	this is a lovely flowing lingerie that would compliment many body shapes. the color is attractive too. not too bold and bright!
240940	this nightgown is much more transparent than the picture leads one to believe. and although it is sexy and hugs the body, it doesn't look quite as glamourous when its not the model pictured. the color also appears a bit off (darker for me) than in the ad. not significantly (except for the thong), but noticeably. not a big deal. it's either an issue with lighting on the photographed model or a dye lot color change. it's also quite soft.
240955	this looks like a sneaker from the outside, but it is a canvas shoe with sparks on the outside (and great tread on the bottom).  i was surprised when i got it bc we have owned many pairs of stride-rite and i've never seen one constructed of canvas -- now i know why this one was so much less expensive than the other stride rites.  it is still a good shoe, and good for climbing & running (bc of the great tread), but i do not expect it to hold up as well as the others would.  on a bright note, on day 1, my daughter stepped into a muddy lake in her new shoes.  i wiped down the outside and rinsed the shoe in the sink (i was afraid a full-blown washing machine cycle would destroy the sequins), and they look new again.
241082	i bought this to replace a different style organizer (which was not particularly useful)this one was a better fit and it has lots of pockets and two zipper compartments. it comes in several colors, so i ordered another color to give as a gift.whereas the previous organizer was too deep, this one could be a teensy bit deeper. nonetheless---it does the job quite well.i would definitely recommend it ... and in fact ... i have!
241126	sturdy main pocket. inexpensive. stylish. lots of outer pockets... so you can fit a lot in a little bag. i would give it five starts...unfortunately, the stupid pockets keep coming open when i am walking, or if i get jostled on the train, or you know, fill them up. they're secured, you see, by these infuriatingly-flimsy little snaps under the sturdy-looking buckle/loop things which you would think serve the purpose from looking at the picture, and as a result, you really run the risk of losing any valuables you don't want to keep in the zipper pocket. which basically reduces this in function to a big purse with decorative pockets. i mean, you could definitely put your stuff in the outer pockets (providing you don't overload them) but... any risk of losing your keys, your phone, your charger... just makes this something i have very little use for.oh and if you leave the buckle thing open and the snap comes unfastened, you can lose part of your bag. which would make it look dumb.i guess if you have a soldering iron, or wanna sow through the leather, you could affix the snap part to the bag, and use the loops. that would make it pretty nice. but who's actually going to do that?
241229	i love this bead. it looks 10x better than the picture. it's so sparkly. looks great on my pandora bracelet. i'm still amazed at the price. this bead even comes in a little box too. the shipping is great, it came in 4days with standard shipping. i would definatly recommend this bead.
241321	i'm very happy with these gloves! they are stretchy and allow a little room.they go up a little past my elbows(i have short arms). you can pull them all the way up and they will not slide down,or wear them kind of bunched and it still looks good.
241349	these shoes look great and very stylish.  the fit was a little too narrow for my liking. disappointed that i had to return them.
241429	i got this set as part of a gift basket that i put together as a gift for a friend's baby shower. she opened them up and loved them. the designs on the onesies are very cute and i like the different colors. the cupcake theme is adorable. i also felt them and they are really soft. they also are stitched well and didn't have any areas of running or loose stitching.i bought my own kids gerber onesies and found that they held up very well, despite many washings. it is nice to see that gerber is maintaining their standard of good quality with these onesies. and these onesies are so much cuter than just plain white onesies. since there are five of them, they are a great value for the cost. this is an adorable set of onesies to give a new mom!
241465	this set includes 5 onesies with snaps and double stitched hems. the cute little embroideries are also stitched and not decals, so they hold up through laundering. there is an elephant, kitty, &#34;happy&#34;, and cupcakes. there are bright and darling. i like that they are 100% cotton.recommended for quality and value.
241577	hey, these work nicely.  i have not had any slip-offs and they are truly hidden.  i like em and i recommend them.  best price that i have found so far, so that is a bonus too.
241846	this hair accessory is really pretty and looks exactly like the picture :) i also have had no problems getting it to stay in my hair
241858	i absolutely love this hair clip and have ordered an extra one just in case something should happen to the first one. the picture does not do it justice, and the color is much more beautiful in person! i would definitely recommend this hair clip to friends and family.
241874	this piece is so beautiful. looks wonderful, though it took a while to get here. it is totally worth the wait. my hair is really fine but it locks in well. it looks soooo pretty! i cant mention that enough.worth the money, worth the wait and worth the price!!
242002	this shoe looks very nice and can be dressed up or down. they were pretty comfortable to walk in straight out of the box.
242033	great with jeans to wear on weekend to run errands.  put on some socks & the loafer & your good to go. jb
242039	fit perfectly.  comfortable from the moment i put them on.  constructed well as all clark's are.  stylish.  can be worn with jeans or for dress.
242052	shoe is well built and comfortable to walk in except for the size issue. i usually wear a size 11 with no problem. this shoe was too short by at least one half size. i returned the size 11 and replaced with an 11 1/2 which fits perfectly.
242115	this hat has some hanging yarn that i am afraid to snip because it will probably unravel. it's not really as slouchy as i'd like, either. and it took forever to get here. i do like the fact that it isn't too tight around the forehead and it doesn't give me &#34;hat hair&#34;. but i doubt it will make it through the winter. it's more like a beret than a slouch hat.
242208	i ordered a medium which is a tad too big for me ( i am 5'4, 130 lbs.), but i can wear a sweater under it!  the picture looks quite fluffy, but the coat is actually light.  with all that being said, it is a really warm coat and i'm loving the white! i would suggest this coat, seller, and brand to everyone!
242210	this coat is fitted, but not too tight. nice arm length and not bulky. lightweight, filled with real down, but not very warm. really surprisingly not warm. looks great though, shiny fabric makes it seem a bit dressier than other down coats.
242249	i ordered these for my wife and initially ordered a 6b in a slightly different style, which were a bit tight in the box.  since they didn't have those in stock in 6c/d or 6 1/2 b, she kept looking and found these navy pumps.  after considerable soul searching, she opted for the 6 c/d and once again picked the wrong size.  i have ordered her other clarks that are a 6 1/2 b so why she didn't just order that size i write off to brain lock.  the 6 c/d's were just a bit small but in every way were another example of clarks high quality.  they have been returned and 6 1/2 b ordered.  she highly recommends any clarks for comfort and style and finds that 1/2 size bigger in pumps seems to be the rule for her.
242262	i purchased 4 dresses from lb and loooove  them! they arrived about 2 weeks early, and are quality dresses. i love the color of this dress (a little more on the red side than pink.) it is very flattering and hugs all the right places. i am 5'7 150lbs and the m (uk size 12) fits perfectly! snug but very comfortable and easy to breath in. would definitely recommend!
242287	"on the internet watches are one of those items where the list price and the sellers price seem to have no logical connection.  forty-percent, 50%, even 70%+ discounts are far from the exceptional deal; they are the rule.  thus, watches should always be evaluated no on the list price (often inflated to imply luxury/a steal) but on what you get for the money you pay.at around $200, this invicta offers a lot for the price.  of course, watches are a lot about the wearers particular aesthetic.  this watch is large, and will almost certainly be too large for one who prefers a trimmer more classic style. that said, large faced watches seem to be ""in,"" and i for one take some delight in how this watch blends certain classic deco elements (the highly textured white face and the elegant silver numbers which match the body color are just two examples).  the red highlights are understated, which lessens the ""bling"" effect when worn as does the fact that the metallic blue hands are so dark that they often appear black.  for those interested in contrast, click over to the invicta 14331 which is near identical but with a gold body and electric blue numbers creating a far flashier look.  so again, if you like large, but less colorful, this is likely a watch you should consider.in terms of the mechanism, everything about the watch thus far speaks to a solid design.  i usually find multiple dial watches busy and annoying to set.  these issues don't really occur with this watch owing to the understated design of the secondary dials and the clever ""quick set"" buttons which make setting a breeze! the watch also comes with multiple bands that are very easily swapped out.  the bands, as is often the case with new watches, come out of the box a bit stiff, but i expect they will soften with time and wear.  still, it takes about a minute to change the band color, a feature sure to appeal to those committed to color coordination.to sum up, i can say nothing negative about this item at this price.  indeed, i'll be wearing mine with pleasure.  just make sure that you like that large watch look!"
242397	that the wall street journal hasn't yet filed a suit by ralph lauren against the maker of these shorts is a bit surprizing. down to the logo and the brand name they run so close to ralph lauren polo that one could easily think they were. that said, they're great shorts, fit well, launder well and are a convenience in summer when shorts that can go anywhere from the swimming pool to an informal party are to be desired. they're well made, well thought out, the design fits almost any man. i happen to like shorts of this kind which have a built in &#34;liner&#34; code meaning you don't need underwear although depending on your activity wearing a jock might be a good idea. are they durable? ask me next summer as, just now, they're getting a lot of wear. the price is more than right and i fully intend to buy at least one more pair in a lighter colour. that is assuming the lauren organization doesn't put a legal foot on their neck and halt their sale.
242459	love this boot so much that i ordered it also in brown!!! this is my third pair of this boot!  i love it! so comfortable!
242476	i really like these clarks.  they fit well, look good and i can wear them all day.  the embossing adds a classy, casual look to the shoes.  they are on the large side of 8 but with more substantial socks they fit well.
242478	they fit perfectly.  very comfortable.  zipper makes them easy to get on & off.  i love my clarks, and will not wear anything else.
242515	i can count on clarks to provide spot-on 10 m shoe size, so i am pleased with the fit. the loafers are not only comfortable but stylish with casual pants or jeans. the heel is a bit lower than shown in the picture, but not a problem for me. a good quality shoe.
242539	these shoes are exactly what i expected. clarks are the most consistent brand of shoes that i know of and once again they proved it to be so.
242554	these are a really great pair of ankle boots and have looked high and low for the color i bought.  i do wish there was more cushion in the heel as these are clark's.
242613	but yet so very sexy.  i love the feel of the material. honestly, it is so very soft.  order this!!
242617	after the last top i must admit was a bit apprehensive b/c the last one was sooo thin & way toooo small. but the other 5 tops of patty's i have--i love, so i decided to get this one b/c it looked so sexy and different, and i would return it if it didn't fit instead of giving it away. well. i just love it! it's what we've all been asking for! better material, better length, and they're still so comfortable! thank you for listening to your customers patty! love it! (update)===nov=3/2013 here i am again buying the olive one! i loved the black one, so i decided to get another color. this one is an olive grayish color.  the style looked good on me, and i was the first one to write a review on this top. a message for those who have a wider middle or tummy, try wearing a vest to hide it.
242622	the sizing chart says to order based on bust size, but i have found that the shirts fit better if you order a size larger than they recommend. i am not in the best shape, therefore i do have some extra to hide. choosing the extra large (which is what i usually wear) instead of their recommended large, fits just right. not too loose and not too tight. i am a repeat customer of patty women, as all of their clothes are well made, soft and comfortable. take it from me, you really do get what you pay for!
242661	i am wowed by these tops - i bought two.  they are super soft, very comfortable during vinyasa flow yoga, and really attractive as well.  these are going to be my go-to yoga tops.
242662	i love this top!  it is very comfortable and works fabulous jogging, riding a bike or weight training for me.  i love love love the fact that it is long.  i am always tugging at shirts because they feel short but this top is nice and long.  even with my love handles showing i embrace the way my body feels and looks in this.  thanks for making a great product.  i look forward to buy more!
242680	this is a very nice detailed ring. i get lots of compliments. great price, great value, and a very nice ring.
242689	at first i was concerned that these earrings would be small about the size of studs or a bit bigger but to my surprise they are actually a nice size and the lion head is very much noticeable...i love them and they look great with the necklace and bracelet as well.
242692	i had been looking for lion door knockers that weren't too large, and these were just what i was looking for!  the photo here does make it seem like they are larger; you have to read the dimensions before purchasing.  i think that if they were bigger, they would look tacky.  the shine of the &#34;gold&#34; hasn't diminished in the months i have had it.the shipping cost was actually more than the item!
242759	i love these boots. i must have perused every boot on multiple online stores and ultimately settled on this one and i'm glad i did. they look great and fit great!
242761	these boots were so tight/uncomfortable around the toe area. i would not order these if you have a medium to wide foot. wish the reviews were more honest. least comfortable boot i've ever bought from clarks products.
242791	tried these on at the mall to get the correct fit. had to size down a half size. great boot, very comfortable. able to purchase at 30 percent off with amazon.
242792	i was looking for a pair of bootie. after comparing this with sam eldman petty boots, i decided to buy this one. i usually wear size7 and order size 7. it fits ok, a little bit lose. but i know that half size down would be too small. the arch support is not that perfect for me since i have high arch. overall, it is nice and i decide to keep it.
242820	now my wife didn't like this bra and all the other ones she didn't like i gave bad reviews but not this one, it was soooo sexy and although my wife didn't like it, i did.... it would be nice if all the manufacturers could get together and have standard sizes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
242828	i like everything about this tie except for the fact it arrived with a huge black spot right on the front of the tie. it almost looked like motor oil?? i was able to return for full refund but was really disappointed they were out of stock. i still don't understand how a new tie would have a huge black spot on it.  the other tie i purchased (in light blue) was perfect.
242898	bought 2 of the cami's for work, its difficult to find something in blue that i like! the items arrived quickly which was great & they fit perfectly, definatley would recommend these!
242928	i'm pretty short. at 5', i wondered if these boots would look awkward (sometimes knee high boots can be really hit or miss), but they look really cute. i ordered a half-size larger based on some other reviews, and they fit perfectly. there are no issues with how they fit my calves... they are a bit large, but it's not remarkable. the size thing is kind of puzzling, as some have found their regular sizes to be perfect, but in all i would say that if your shoe size runs to 6-6 1/2, 7-7 1/2, etc, get the larger size. i can wear anywhere from a 6, 6 1/2, or 7 depending on the brand of shoe.you know, it's kind of like clothing: i know that i'm actually a size 2, but for some reason all of the clothes i buy seem to run super small and i end up in a 6!! it's so strange!anyhow, i digress.the quality of the material is good, but not great. however, they are very reasonably priced and well worth what you pay. i have worn these boots several times and there are no scratches, scuffs or tears.i wonder how they would look if i actually wore them while riding a horse.recommended!
242961	these boots are great and for the price i was impressed it says they run small so i went up a size and they are just a touch big but with a sock they should be fine.
242964	i ordered a 7.5, i have been the same size since i was a teenager my foot is not wide but i could not even get it past the arch in my foot with just stockings on.. ridiculous! had my daughter who is a size 6 try them on and she finally was able to get it on over her foot but they were too tight on her..then when i went to ship them back it was 18 dollars! and if i order an 8 what if i cant get my foot into those either and if i go up to an 8.5 it will be to long if i finally get my foot it..just disappointed because these were exactly what i had been wanting..
242987	good boots. they are light weight and not heavy at all. they fit true to size. very fashionable!! love them!
243027	these shoes are a beautiful dark rich red (crimson) color.  in fact, it was just a perfect color for my grandson since it's the exact color of the alabama crimson tide!!!  and, this is the fourth pair that i've ordered of this shoe and my grandson loves them.  the price is great too.  certainly going to be more if you find them out in the store...and on line... i haven't seen a price to beat it.  of course, i had to order these in a size 18 so i really had a limited choice of different styles to pick from.  but these do not lack style.  if you're a new balance fan, these are great school, or day shoes.  my grandson swears they're most comfortable.  all i know is that i could make a dog bed out of the shoe boxes for a size 18....  they fit, they are comfortable, they are the right price, and they look as good as, and in this case better than, the picture.  on my computer they're good looking in the picture, when we got all of them, they looked even better!  we were not disappointed in any aspect when we got them, we were pleasantly surprised.  we have the black, the navy, the green and now the red. would recommend these without a doubt!!!
243052	these are over an inch in length, but very light weight. they are very cute and cool looking. highly recommend.
243064	fits as i expected. not the highest quality product but not planning to wear very long. provides support. slightly tighter than i would want for a daily wear item but suits the need in this case.
243070	hey anything my wife wants to wear like this for me, im all for it!  nothing but spicing up the sex life!  looks great, and fully functional! lol
243164	"this ""sterling silver simulated diamond oxidized celtic tree of life pendant necklace"" is a very pretty and nicely made piece of jewelry that would make a nice gift for a teenager. the pendant hangs from an 18"" chain that is a little thinner than i think it should be, but that is easy enough to switch out if the need arises.the detail is nice and the ""simulated diamond"" appears to be good quality and not cheesy looking in any way. it also comes with a decent black velvet bag to store the necklace when not being worn.recommended!cfh"
243176	sucks, heavy, scratchy, bad fit and stupid logo on the arm. i didn't like anything about this shirt and i use it to wash my dog now.
243217	love these boots, i was looking for boots that either had buckles or laced up and these have both! they are tight on my calf but its not the boot, i just have big calves :( luckily you can adjust because they lace. after about wearing for 4 hours, they broke in nicely.
243251	love this blouse! not something you see everyday. it fits like a juniors medium. if you normally wear a misses medium i would probably get a large. i'm in between small and medium in misses and the medium fit as shown in the picture. sleeves are a great length for me. i'm 5 ft and around 125lbs. snug fit but a large would have been to big.
243285	i get compliments when i wear this blouse. i have the black one also. i wash them with my regular laundry and dry them in the dryer and they held up great. the sleeves are shorter than expected but i can deal with it for the price.
243301	"i just received this shirt in the mail yesterday.  it's true to size, which doesn't always happen when you buy online.  it looks just like the picture.  i'm looking forward to wearing it out.  my only complaint is that i wish the sleeves were a bit longer.  i'm 5'10"", so this happens often anyway.  other than that, it's really cute and fits nice."
243320	i bought this in a large and extra large, bc of the reviews but i must say the large fit perfect. the extra large was too big. i must say i love allegra k, never had any issue with them. will continue to shop with that company and feel comfortable placing my order.
243334	i had intended on purchasing a different pair of timberland's, but when i tried them on in the store, i like these much better.  plain is good.  they fit my calf perfectly too.  i'm small so someone with larger calves will probably have a difficult time with these.  i actually planned on purchasing these at the timberland store in stratham, but when i saw how much cheaper they were on amazon, i bought them.  needless to say, the lady at the store was pissy with me because i commented that they were cheaper here.  i do find that you need to try on timberland's simply because each style can vary drastically from another regardless of the size.
243370	the fit was very narrow, and a 9m is what i always wear; i exchanged it for the timberland women's savin hill chelsea ankle boot in a 9m, which was a great fit.
243386	i have really mixed feelings about these ....i got these to wear with jeans and sweats, and they're ok. i have big feet (11 c); i have other naturalizer shoes, and that's the size that seems to work best. these are just a little on the narrow side -- not totally uncomfortable, but not as comfortable as i had hoped. i can wear them with most of my socks, but not with the heaviest ones that i like to wear in the winter.bottom line: even within a given manufacturer, the sizing can vary. some of my naturalizer 11cs fit great; these don't quite measure up. they'll work, but they're not quite what i had come to expect from naturalizer. four stars because they're definitely a quality item, should last a long time.
243447	the style and cut is really nice. there could be some more comfort lining, but overall a really nice shoe for skirts or pants.
243467	i read a review and ordered a bigger back size to compensate for larger cup size.  very comfortable.  wiresemi circle smaller than my breast but i just gently glided them through and it was a very endowed sexy lookwhich imediately turned my husbands head and he followed me away from the game on tv.i ordered two different color open bras and they came together in this cute little black pouch so that i cankeep them together with my other delicates.  very happy with purchase.
243470	i got this in the mail pretty quickly, received ahead of time; could just be luck though.the package was discrete and the bra was encased in plastic inside the envelope, tagged, clean, and good looking.quality is great for what you pay for, i imagine i will have this for a long time. it's rather pretty.why only 4 stars? i'm a 36d (i'm 5'7&#34; and 136lbs) sometimes i am a dd depending on the brand but, in most cases i am a d. i ordered a 36 size bra. though the 1/4 cup would probably fit a c, this does not fit perfectly for me as a d. i can still wear it, my boyfriend loves it, but it's not something i feel totally sexy in simply because of the fit.  the wire does not follow my breasts and does not run parallel to my sternum which i think most women look for in a bra. since the bra has little support, the bra stretches forward giving more of a &#34;shelf&#34; effect and less of a bustier look. i kind of get a &#34;muffin&#34; look too if you know what i mean.
243525	i recently bought an &#34;average&#34; size pocket watch/necklace! it is beautiful and i didn't want two but i saw the intricate butterfly on it and the &#34;antique&#34; look sold me!! it took a while to arrive it wasn't due until after christmas or two weeks after that,but i arrived home from a vacation on christmas day and i looked into my mail box yeah it's here!! but...... i kept opening it and nothing . i was so disappointed but wait there was this cracker jack size watch. it's gorgeous and numbers are so clear! it's better in person. i took off my other( which i still love) but this one means a lot! the butterfly symbols something ever so precious to me and to receive it on christmas wow!! i love it! be prepared how tiny it is but it's everything else i hoped for!!!!!!!!!!  the size is about the circumference of a quarter but thick as an average one!  bellisimo!!! grazie
243569	it is a simple design, but works well. the turning colors for the seconds is interesting. would buy as a gift.
243656	looks great, just a bit too big. however the lens keep falling out after a few weeks of wearing, might as well bought a chinese cheapy locally.
243673	if you would like to change up your wardrobe, order this jacket for an edgy look. i wanted something different than the general, mainstream jackets you find at department stores....this jacket is definitely it!!! it's comfortable and fits well. really compliments your waistline.love this jacket! what i would like to know is when will they get the blue one in size 8-10?! i'd like to order that one as well!
243682	i am usually a size 2 but got the 2-4 (which is actually a size 4). it fits well; better than another jacket from them i got but it has huge shoulder pads in it which are very ugly. you cannot return their items unless you have the original packaging and they do not refund the exorbitant shipping prices they charge so i will not be able to return it. if i can find a way to take out the shoulder pads and sew it back up then i will wear it but if not then it will have been a big waste of money since it was so expensive.
243691	i dont always like to wear a watch so this is really a nice alternative and i love the splash of color
243717	i liked the style and the price was good but found them to difficult to put on. i had to use a shoe horn to wedge my foot in. once on my feet the shoes felt pretty comfortable but since i was looking for shoes that are easy to slip on i decided to return them.
243718	i really liked this shoe its made well  and would look nice with pants .i only gave it a three because of the width even though i ordered a 6 wide i couldn't get my foot in and they don't come in an extra wide so i'm returning them and trying a different style that comes in a wider size . my order came within 5 days and sending them back was easy
243785	colorful bird design is very darling!!  my daughter is 40 pounds and this fit her with some room to go.
243838	this is a denim like material.  it is nice for the corset, but for the thong it is very stiff.  i would definitely not wear the thong, i just threw it away, also it had odd material like elastic for the sides and was really large.  but i only purchased this for the corset, so it didn't matter.  i like that it has a flap of material that goes underneath the lacing, so your skin does not show through the lacing in the back.  it looks nice and because it is denim, it's casual enough to wear with jeans.  i'm happy with it.
243846	"the picture is deceiving, the leggings do not look anything like it. then you have the fact that they are small enough to fit a 13yo, no way should they be listed as ""women"" leggings.  and the 'chemical smell!'  very bad!  but...intimates21 was very pleasant to deal with and kindly refunded my money right away.**revision** my bad, the seller was afire store not intimates 21. afire offered to refund half the price & let me keep the leggings ""as a gift,"" or refund all when they receive the returned item. of course im not returning them as postage to china would cost me more than the price of the leggings!!**"
243899	very nice thick shirt but not big and tall as advertised especially after first wash shrunk so bad my gut was showing.
243922	i'm 125 and these fit great. nice and snug without feeling suffocated! i thought they were cotton when i bought them (my mistake), but they are like super thick tights, when you stretch them out they have a shine to them.
243948	i bought these leggings to peek out from underneath longer tops and tunics, however, in direct sunlight, i could see my underwear through them. (it was pink, i mean surely black would have been a different story...but still) i expected these to be a little thicker, however they are still very comfortable. i'm 5'5&#34; and the leg length is still long- i would suggest if you're short, look for something else as the legs bunch around my ankles.one last annoyance, they arrived with a rip in the side of the leg, and i wanted to exchange them for a new pair, but it would require me to drive to the actual warehouse in order to do so. i opted to just mend them myself, as i can do so, but i found this a little frustrating.all in all, they're comfy, good fit, and with some black undies, a long shirt, and a tiny bit of mending, they'll do what i need.
243960	would not have bought this except for the positive review, so i thought it couldn't hurt to purchase it since the price was so low.  i'm so glad i did purchase it - this tunic is absolutely sweet, especially for the price.  it looks great with my leopard leggings and beige pumps - top has suede patches and is made really well and is very comfy.  fits to size.  definitely go for it.
243965	really impressed with the color, they do an excellent job of dyeing this shirt. very well made. but it did shrink.  i think i would like it better with a pocket.
244016	im 50/50 on this shirt. the price was ok and the quality seems decent, but it is a little on the thin side. think somewhere between vintage style washed and hanes heavyweight. the black is 100% cotton, but i was expecting 50/50 blend. for around $5 you can get almost any brand blank t-shirt that may be a little thicker then these.
244193	i have bought a couple of rings from this vendor and they are all stunning and exactly as advertised. it goes with everything!
244249	comfy, warm however, a bit on the tight side for someone who someone who wears a size 10/ 10.5 shoe
244250	i am a size 8.5-9 (female) and these barely fit. i like them and they are comfortable, but you can tell the material is cheap.
244280	these shoes are super cute, and comfortable.  i have a somewhat wide foot (not wide enough to order 'w'), and these didn't pinch my toes like some other shoes i have.  the wedge is a nice height, and easy to walk in.  the color is exactly as shown.  highly recommend.
244294	this bra is really supportive. i do like it but i'll only be wearing it with shirts that are not extremely fitted because of the shape of the cup. it makes my boobs look pointed and to me, it looks unnatural. like i said it is very supportive and gives great lift and pushes the girls up nicely, i just wished the shape of the cup was not so projected. i ordered a 32 dd and that's my usual size so i would say it runs pretty true to size. also, the straps are fully adjustable which is great because i'm petite and need to tighten my straps almost all the way. good bra just keep in mind the slight projection.
244297	pros: the colors are fun and the materials sturdy. it gives good cleavage.cons: the cups run a bit small, giving a quad-boob effect. the band is very stretchy.the 30dd fits more like a 32d.i'd suggest going down a band size and up at least one cup size.
244380	they are ok, seem to run small but it was too good of a deal to pass up.  order more in a larger size.
244435	this shoe, which i bought for 1/2 price on a deal of the day, is amazingly comfortable and is now my go to casual sneaker.
244442	i bought these shorts in 4 different colors for the purpose of golfing.  they have some stretch to them and are very comfortable.  the fit it true-to-size, and as depicted, fall just above the knee.  my chief complaint is that even when properly secured, the zipper falls of its own accord.  i've been wearing my polo shirt untucked so it's ok, but when i start playing at more rigid courses with dress codes that require them to be tucked in, i have a problem, you see?  i'm not sure if it's my shape or a design flaw.  it happens with all pairs. so heads up.  or...fore!
244451	the pearls are beautiful and what a good price value, i feel like i should send in more money.  i am a pearl nut and dont like to spend the money on real ones because you have to take special care of them.  the color is just like the pics too  you could not ask for a nice set.
244463	the ring is really pretty. however the material (whatever is used) made my skin on my finger start peeling. i have sensitive skin, but i wear commercial jewlery all the time and i've never had this happen before. thought it was just me so i cleaned it, then gave it to my friend to wear.  same thing happend to her. i mean the seller was great and maybe i just got a faulty ring.. don't know. i guess you get what you pay for.
244502	i really like the product since the moment that i start to usedit's naturalreally works!!!!i am a happy customer
244521	"as of this review i own 21 pair of vibram fivefingers shoes, and need just a few more pairs!  i knew before i bought my first pair that many vff owners loved their shoes but reported the single biggest drawback was they became foul smelling.  i have some sneakers that i'm afraid to wear around people because of their odor  and knew i wanted to try something before i started wearing my vff's.  i just started looking online for a product or products that i could try and luckily came across rocket pure's natural deodorant spray!  two things it mentioned made me choose it, first it mentioned dealing with odors caused by bacteria and secondly, it said ""natural"".my daily regimen before putting on my vff's is to simply wash my feet, spray rocket pure on each foot and rub it around by hand, especially making sure to get some in between my toes, done!  first off, i love the pepperminty aroma and second, my feet and shoes smell great whether i've worn them for an hour or eight hours.  granted, i own enough pairs that i can rotate what i wear regularly, but i really don't think it would matter.  i can take any pair, stick my nose down inside and not be the least offended by what i smell.  for most people who love vff's, the experience would be perfect except for the odor problem, and it's a problem that can literally cause people to stop using and buying them.  my vff experience has been a perfect one because of rocket pure.  i'm writing this review so others know there's hope for them as well.  one last comment, when i first went looking for something i didn't just buy rocket pure, but i've yet to try the two other products i bought because rocket pure spray is so easy and convenient, smells so good and works so well that not only do i doubt the other products could duplicate those results, but i really look forward to my rocket pure experience each day.  i'm someone who just got lucky!update: since this review i've added 6 more pairs of vff's to my collection, call me crazy ... as i'm sure many do, but that's quite alright!  i love my vff's (obviously that's all i wear) and now my rocket pure!"
244556	good fit ,colors very nice will be buying more of skechers ,no problem yet, keep up the good stuff coming.
244606	this ring can be purchase and worn by both men and woman.the ring has the southwest look as to native american jewelry.i would recommend this ring to friends of both sexes.nice look to add too your jewelry collection for a very low price.
244653	much prettier than the picture, but they sent me the wrong size!!!!!! i'm super sad i can't wear it while i'm wearing my other rings because it only fits on the same finger as my other ones.... i tried to order different size. but no  such luck.... but it is a beautiful ring and i get lots of compliments.
244677	these are soon amazingly cute! the fit is perfect. the shipping was a little slow but i would totally buy another pair
244695	um. yeah so i'm really pissed off! i want my money back. i got the wrong pair. i got some bow one?.. i'm seriously upset. totally calling amazon and getting my money back. i always get the wrong thing when i order?? ..... :(
244704	i really like these leggings. they are of good quality, look just like the picture, and have a nice silky feel to them. the only thing that threw me off a bit was their size. i ordered the xs expecting the leggings to be tight and fit me like they fit the model in the picture. however, they are a tad bit baggy on my legs (i'm 117) so instead of getting a sexy see through look the material sort of just hangs off my legs making it difficult to see that there is a sexy sheer design to these pants. i still love the leggings. i just wish the material stretched across my legs so the neat overlapping design could be shown off.
244720	when i opened these i thought that they looked cheep and ugly. i wondered why i bought them. they are a thin, shiny material that looks like it could just fall apart.once i put them on, everything changed. although not the highest quality, they really look great on. feminine and trendy. you won't get years out of them, but they are fine for today's trends.
244727	it's not a heavy duty belt, but it does the job and the buckle holds securely.  the reason for 5 stars has to do with the fact the rainbow belt brings back fond memories of my then 4 year old grand daughter.
244752	loved these boots. i agree with some other reviewers that they run a little big if ordering your regular size. i just wore thicker socks, and they are perfect. plenty of toe room, both vertically and width; in fact, the shoes themselves are fairly wide, so if you have narrow feet, these may not be a good fit. very soft material around the ankles. ordered another pair.
244770	the colors are vibrant, and the fit is wonderful: not too high of a heel so i can wear them all day. i always order a half size larger with heels like this and they fit perfectly.
244784	"normally, i like a chunkier heal for stability (i'm a curvy girl.) however, i needed a formal shoe for a special occassion and i took a chance on this shoe. it was worth it!!! it fits well and it doesn't hurt. it's a high heel, but it doesn't do that toe breaking, 90 angle thing like some ultra high hills. instead, it's designed with a perfect slope that actually feels good and the structure of the heal and ankle strap provide stability, while looking super sexy. be warned, the dark blue color is almost purple and it doesn't match any blue dress i have. however, the shoes were just that nice, that i kept them anyway! i wore them to work with an all white outfit and i got compliments from several people. i wish they had more ""normal"" colors."
244814	i was so lookin forward to gettin this ring but my daughter got a hold of it before i did and she wudnt give it back .... so im not happy but she is.. been meaning to order me another one just haven't done it!!!!
244848	i got this a few days before the expected delivery date. it shipped within a couple hours of ordering. overall i love the ring. the infiniti sign isn't too large and not too small. it's perfect on any finger. i chose mine to be on my ring finger. i will get back to this review in a few weeks and tell you guys if the ring changed color or turned my finger green. overall i rate this as a 5 star!
244865	this is the pink color i was looking for.  very cute ankle boot.  i have to struggle to get them on and they are somewhat tight so i cannot wear them all day long.  i would recommend ordering a size up.
244936	be honest with yourself and the sizing will work for you, in fact, i was so pleased with the first one, i thought for sure i could go down 1 size. do not do that if you are on the smaller end of the sizes. for example i wear an 18/20 because i'm an 18. i went down a size to 14/16. not happenin. you might get away with it if you are the bigger size. this skirt is stretchy and sexy. because it holds tight it gives the illusion that i am thinner and that i have a decent backside. it does not ride up. usually the price is the exact same on amazon as it is on it's on-line web site. i have problems with that web site so i just order from amazon.
244942	arrived promptly. prettier than expected. it's my go to top when i need something that looks nice and is comfortable too. i have a lot of regular doctor's appointments and this is works out great for those. i look nice and if i need to remove it, it slips over my head easily. i should have ordered more colors. it's still there for the same great price so maybe i probably will.
244974	my grand daughter loves this cool and comfortable maternity top that i bought for her. we are very pleased with this maternity top and the quick delivery . i would most defitenly recommend this top . the color is beautiful , the material is wonderful for these warm/ and hot days for the expent mother.
244975	this is a wonderfully shear, light top for those hot summer days. the fit is correct and my suggestion would be to hand wash this garment. the top does wrinkle but i think it's to be expected. i bought 3 in different colors and am very pleased.
245063	this slipper has superior arch support. actually this slipper has more arch support than most of the other orthaheel shoes.  i wear and ordered a size 9 and it fit perfect.  there is plenty of toe room.  this is the best orthaheel slipper.  this slipper has the all around support of the best orthotic shoe and it looks and feels like wearing a slipper.  i love it.  i am so happy to have an orthaheel slipper that i can slip on and wear around the house.  this shoe gets an a++.
245064	i have been having a hard time finding the right shoes.  these have the arch support i need and they are soft inside.  my heel still wants to slide out a little bit, but i have that problem with most of my shoes.  i think my heel is just narrow.these are some of the best shoes i have.  too bad they are slippers and i can't wear them to town or i would.
245124	i normally wear a 9 1/2, but since these come only in whole sizes, i ordered a 10. they were gigantic! both much too long and much too wide. i can't comment on their comfort because i had to return them. just wanted to warn you about the sizing. for me, anyway, ordering a 1/2 size down would have made more sense. i didn't like them enough to re-order. they look/feel kind of cheap for $90 shoes. i guess you're paying for the special footbed, not the styling or the materials.
245137	its very slimming and all but the under clasp is very uncomfortable and i'm tempted to cut it out! :(
245202	i bought these for my husband.  he is a 33 x 29 and they don't come in 29 but only 30 length.  i might have to take them up but i expected to do that.  what a nice quality pair of pants.  i love the fig color too.  it is rich looking.  got them in 2 days too.  very very impressive.
245342	this is a wonderful scarf. soft jersey i love it.  it looks great with causal wear.  dress up a simple outfit. great
245366	bought these to serve as slipper/shoe sort of hybrids to use for quick, cold dog walks - and for that purpose they're perfect - these are great and very cozy and warm. they're also easy to slip on and off and fit true to size. i wear these not only on dog walks but also quick trips to the store and (don't hate me) i even wear them to my super-casual office in lieu of real shoes.so - given that i wear these to so many places, these shoes could use more padding on the soles - am i using them for more than they're probably intended? i'm going to guess that's a yes - so if you don't require them to have a lot of padding, these are great - if you're looking for a slipper/shoe to wear to your liberal dress-code place of employment - your feet may get tired and sore by the end of the day from lack of a good insole.
245369	well, these arrived today and look just great. it will be easy to &#34;spot&#34; (no pun intended) our luggage at the airport. sturdy but i think sometimes the luggage guys cut them off. time will time with these, but as long as they last we will be &#34;spotting&#34; them easily!
245461	if you like skulls and rings and watches this is for you ! very cool (but won't fit fat fingers) it does stretch but not that much
245464	awesome ring watch. it looks great, so far keeps an accurate time. i bought it for my daughter for halloween. it seems she loves it and many of her friends were complimenting her and inquiring about the watch.
245480	the fit was good on this item.  it doesn't look quite like a real diamond but from a distance it can pass. very shiny & sparkly. can dress up or down.  paid a very nominal price & it was worth it.
245486	anytime you want to show some bling but don't want to wear your good stuff, this is a great ring to wear.  i put it with a silver band and no one will know it is a &#34;great fake.&#34;  i love this ring so much, i bought two and gave one to a friend.
245492	the ring is ok. the top design is smaller than i thought and it fits snug. my ring size has not changed and this is the second rose gold ring i purchased from here that is small. i'm not sure if they are just made cheap or what the issue is. but the finger i intended on wearing it on is definitely not possible unless i want to cut off my circulation.
245495	this a truly stunning ring with its crystal/swirl design and rounded edges.  the price was great and i love wearing it!
245499	the crystals in this ring are so sparkly, it's a joy to wear. i am a repeat customer and will keep coming back, as am always delighted with the items and enjoy that the shipping is usually much quicker than expected - in some instances they are even quicker than national orders.
245512	first, let me say that i ordered &#34;medium&#34; even though i wear a size 2 in clothing, so technically i am a small.  but i don't like to wear underwear that feels tight so i generally buy a medium or 6 in panties.  so, the fact that i found these fit somewhat large may not really be accurate - just slightly larger than the way they usually fit me.  -- other than that, the other point you may want to consider on this particular style (high cut) is that it may not fit you quite right if you are tall, long-waisted, and angular like me.  the reason is that the material bunches up between the waist and the top of the pad.  i think if you have a little bit more around the hips or are smaller-waisted, these would work well for you.  the quality of these is very, very nice.  they would hold up well.  the pads provided give a very gentle boost, so if you are not looking for a huge difference, these would be for you.  they look good under jeans, though i would not wear with clingy material as the pad line might show. the nice thing is that there are a set of pads provided with each pair of panties, and one extra set of pads that is slightly thicker, in case you want more boost.  the little lingerie bag is a nice touch.  all in all, these are a very good buy if you have the right body type, and for a longer-waisted person i would recommend trying a lower rise.  of course, when my husband saw that i was browsing booty pads, he said he thought booty pads are a waste of money and that he thinks i am fine the way i am.  so i guess that's good, but if you are thin like me, there are definitely times when a little curve under clothes can be fun, and what better reason is there than that?
245515	i liked the effect of the insta booty padded panty.  i have a vitamin deficiency, called noassatol, so this really helped.  there are two types of inserts; one is silicone and the other foam.  i recommend the foam over the silicone as the silicone was very heavy.  after a while, i felt like i was carrying around a load in my pants!  i usually wear an xl, but i had to get the l, which may still be a little big, but i'll stick with the large for now.
245516	for someone like me who has medical conditions that causes me to lose everything i had behind, these are perfect!  eventhough my husband says he loves me the way i am, these do help my self-esteem a lot!
245546	i had to send the first dress back some of the seam over the breast was apart.  these dresses arrived in a couple days, and returning it was easy.  i do not like the padding in the breast if your big busted like my step daughter i bought it for these pads look like she has saucers on her breasts.  it would be nice if we could remove them.  i think if the pads were covered the whole breast area they would not stand out.  other then that, this is a nice dress.
245596	the shorts are made to leave little to the imagination and show a lil &#34;cheek.&#34;  i love the way they look on her. it made our caribbean excursion well worth it! i have to keep this at a &#34;g&#34; rating so just know that it will personify sexiness in and out of the water...(smile)
245851	like many moms, i want my kids to be able to swim with appropriate, non-wedgie causing, quality swimwear. after many suit purchases locally from brand names, i decided to try this. i am so impressed. it's quality. it covers what should be covered. it fit well (though a tad too snug  in a 10 in my opinion, and my daughter is 9 and on the slender ~ slightly smaller side for her age) and stays in place as she swims and dives. worth the price, plus the fabric holds up well to the heavily chlorinated pool we use about 5-6 days a week, others have worn so thin they got tossed. i like it so much i plan to get my younger daughter one, and as soon as my third daughters suit kicks the bucket, speedo will be where i look!
245883	i have washed and worn 1 pair of thr socks once,and there are 2 holes in the calves.  totally sucks. cute socks.
245966	if you like to see a man's butt buy these for him.  and i hope your man's looks as good as my man does.
245977	you can't go wrong with yellowbox, they are so comfy and cute. i have had another pair for 4 years and they are still as comfy as the day i bought them.
245999	love the ring the sliver hearts and cz diamond are very real looking just like a real diamond ring for anyone that is going to order this ring please size up , this ring fit is small.
246017	i bought this for a trip to the islands and it was perfection.  fun and easy to wear and pack.
246038	i bought this for a reddit doctor who gift exchange for a girl i'd never met before who lived three states away from me.  she said she loved scarves so i thought this would be perfect.  when she received the gift she was absolutely ecstatic and said it was the perfect length and great quality.
246040	exactly as described, and it is warm. thank you!  it arrived on time and was packaged well.  i have no complaints.  still debating if i want to keep it or gift it (as i had originally planned)
246060	i love this top.  it is comfortable, long and loose.  it works great with leggings.  also washes well.  no shrinking.
246089	after reading all the posivite reviews, i decided to just go ahead and try this dress. when it came in and i put it on, i immediately loved it! it hugs all my curves and makes my body look great. i'm about 5'4, 160lbs and with a good amount of curves (mostly hips and thighs) and i got an xl. i showed my boyfriend and he loved it on me! i will most likey order another color!
246094	very nice fit, shows off all my great curves. love how the back drapes low to show just a hint of the crack as a teaser. my only challenge is trying to find shoes to with the pink dress since its not a true pink its a bit hard and doesn't look good with black heels.
246112	love the dress i look amazing in it and it fits beautifully. my boyfriend loved he surprise of this brand new dress for date night.
246120	the product doublju is so awesome. i would recommend to my others friends. its a five star and appeal. it looks classy, sexy as conservative with an interesting look of appeal. the price is just right. i love the packaging and the class of appeal of the sellers type of product. the five star is because awesome business owners that help the consumer deserves all the royalities. i will recommend to other buyers. stay in business i will use you again.
246193	i wear this every day and the quality on it is great. this bracelet keeps it's polish too doesn't tarnish, great gift to give at a great price.
246199	at first i absolutely loved it but after awhile the heart started to turn colors..very disappointing because it looked so cute :(
246244	i bought one of these at a pricey boutique as a splurge during a girls weekend, then checked amazon to see if i could find another after i wore it once and fell in love with it! this is very soft cotton,wears well and feels great! you can wear it off the shoulder for a fun night out look or on the shoulders for more of a daytime look. this is the kind of shirt you could live in all summer! very cool and comfy. it's listed as one size fits all and in my opinion that's accurate unless you are plus size. i don't think you could wear this if you were more than a woman's size 12-14. i normally wear from a large to a medium top (a little busty) but this works perfect for me. if you are reading this review, buy it, you wont regret it!
246292	i really like these shoes, but get your exact size do not order half a size down, because they fit true to size.
246306	comfortable for around the house - expect it to show a lot of cleavage.  it is nice and long to cover the low cut bottoms.
246349	i am a 36b and purchased the lg/xl size and if i were any larger, cup-wise or around, i'd be sending it back because it is definitely on the smaller side. the material is synthetic and slightly slippery and feels nice against my skin. great price and would recommend to anyone my size or lower. not for curvier ladies, as it wouldn't provide any support.
246454	this is just what i hoped for in a flannel shirt.  i bought it a size larger to be able to layer t-shirts under it during the colder months.  the fabric is nice and soft, and the cut is flattering.  the quality is good. two minor minuses:  the buttons are small and lightweight, so if you have arthritis or dexterity issues, it is hard to button.  also, the tag on the back of the neck is rather large, and it's sewn into the fabric in such a way that it would be hard to remove.  the tag may be itchy on the back of your neck, so just be aware of that fact.  overall, a great flannel shirt, just in time for the cold weather here in new jersey.
246472	i work at an office now, but my younger years were spent doing manual labor. my respect and reverence for dickies was born there. i now where these regularly to the office. they fit great, feel comfortable, and have yet to show any signs of wear. i carefully removed the rear-tag. they're indistinguishable from any other pair of slacks. i picked this trick up from airline pilots. a lot of them apparently really like dickies and use that trick to wear them instead of their expensive, uncomfy, and delicate slacks.as always, dickies run a bit narrow. these are made for working men, lean and tough. no shame if you don't fit that description, just order a size or two up accordingly.
246485	"i got the aqua (18) one and it's absolutely true to color. it's fascinating to click up and down the box with the selection of colors at the top of the page.  mine was by far the least expensive--$5.50 with free shipping.  i'm not sure if there are actually 75 different solid colors or combinations but almost all of them are just shy of $10 with free shipping and returns with prime membership.  several cost about the same by adding a $2.50 shipping charge.mine is definitely worth the price.  i'm sort of surprised that people believe that something labeled a ""pashmina...scarf shawl wrap"" could cost under $10 and be expensive wool and silk. on the other hand, that is exactly what the description says.  the reason i didn't give mine 5 stars is that the fiber content tag is way toward the middle of the wrap instead of in a corner or at the end and when i pulled it off, it left 2 little strips of adhesive which don't readily pull off.  i have to figure out if i can use goop or something to remove the adhesive because it will stick to whatever.  whether or not i can get it off, i'll still use it as a wrap or else, like another reviewer, as a tabletop accessory. (our leather sofa has an elbowed hole which this would handily cover up.)based on what others say, for the most part the other solid colors and combinations are usually true to the described and pictured color so, at this price, these are a great deal even though they're not true pashmina.  we see that companies are using the term not as a technical reference to the fiber content but as a synonym for the words scarf, shawl and wrap in the title of the product.mine is light, pretty and soft."
246579	i wish there were more scarves like this. i bought this a while back and forgot about it. just got this yesterday, it is absolutely beautiful and so soft. and at this price, who would have guessed that you could find such a treasure. very happy.
246635	however, while i love the color and the height etc, my wide foot still has problems. the shoes fit, but they feel slightly snug. i've decided to keep them because they're so darned cute. hopefully they will stretch at least slightly. but my foot really deserves the widest width i can find.
246647	these are very pretty earrings but they are huge. i didn't think 2.0 carat stones were so large, but i suppose that could be a &#34;my bad&#34;. the positive note, is that they didn't irritate my ears. i am very sensitive to certain metals, and was worried these would make my ears itch and burn, but they were fine.
246707	i really should learn the metric system! i had no idea that these chains were going to be so thin! i decided to keep the 3 chains that i had ordered because the price was very reasonable and i braided them together to form one thicker looking chain.
246732	ok...i know you wondering for the price what will you get. but if you buy them you won't be disappointed. i intend to wear these for my wedding and they look elegant and classy. they definitely don't look cheap and the stones are very shiny. i look forward to showing these bargain earrings off at the wedding.
246750	i have, for better or worse, wide feet and thick calves. to find a boot that looks attractive -- even sexy -- yet fits me well is a rare treat. across the holidays, i had bought a few new dresses for work, but i live in a wintry climate, and so i really wanted to get a pair of tall boots that i could wear at the office. these fit my feet and my calves very well. although some other reviewers were disappointed that these boots weren't leather, i am actually pleased that they aren't, as it is easy to wipe off salt and other winter grime with a wet cloth in order to make the boots look good as new. they also seem to be water-resistant - no leaks yet:)to address potential purchasers' concerns about the size of the calf/shaft of the boot: try unbuckling all the outside buckles before zipping up the boots, then re-buckling them. the parts of the boot that go into the buckles have three holes precut, each about 1/2 inch apart. you may need to zip and then set the buckles at the loosest setting the first time you wear them. but i found that the leather-look fabric stretches out a bit after a few hours of wear. so the next time i wore the boots, i could zip them up without unbuckling. then i was able to tighten up the buckle setting so the boots did not sag down.one important thing to be aware of, though, is that these boots are completely smooth on the bottom. the artwork on the soles is nifty, but it doesn't add any traction at all. so be super-careful if you are going to wear these boots in rainy, snowy, or icy weather.also, on days when i have to do a lot of standing or walking at work, i've learned that these boots are not particularly comfortable. i bought some gel insoles and hope this solves the problem.
246753	i love this style of top, the only problem i have with the shirt is that the breast part is a little big for me. other then that it is perfect. i love it.
246764	having never bought from this designer i wasnt expecting too much. but i was pleasantly surprised. this top is beautiful. i wore it to church and it was highly complimented. but note it is slightly smaller than regular sizing. go up one size.
246767	i really wanted to like this top, but it is just too cheaply made. love the bright, cheery colors of the fabric&#8230;but not the fabric and -definitely- not the construction. cheap, cheap, cheap-looking. would not recommend buying it, unless i didn't like you.
246779	i'm a size 18 and a 40 c. i purchased 1x in the leopard print. it fits very well, in fact it is quite slimming. i was concerned the neckline would be too plunging, it does plunge, but i didn't have to find a safety pin to keep it closed as i have done for similarly constructed tops. very pretty. bring out your sexy ladies!
246782	bought this top because it looked so pretty. when i got it, it was the same as the photo & the fit was really nice. not to tight and not to slack. bought an xl.
246784	this shirt is really nice and fits great. however, i wish that it would have been made out of a different material. the material is a very shiny, and silky material and just isnt for me.
246804	i always wear size 7 in shoes and have other anne klein shoes, but this is very uncomfortable. it has an odd fit, it is quite long but somehow hurts the heel and the toes. it is too tight up front. i rarely complain about heels, but this really was not comfortable at all even with inserts.color is also not dark red, plum/purplish color. i did not mind the color though. i was looking for something other than black so this is ok though it seems manmade, cheap looking rather. do not recommend.
246807	yes, these seem to run a half size large.  i am a consistent size 7.5 in pumps, though often a 7 in boots, sandals, and athletics.  but i couldn't keep these on in 7.5, so i returned for 7, and they work.  the style and wearability are so attractive, it was worth the effort of returning and reordering to acquire them in three colors.  it would have been five, but tan was sold out in 7, and i returned the bronze snake because it wasn't to my taste.  i wore the red patent for the first time with lace trouser socks and menswear pattern slacks.  the reviews were good, and they were fine for all-day wear.
246813	these are pretty but the sizing is a little off. i wasn't sure if i should get the 7-8 or the 9-10 because i usually wear a 8 1/2 or 9. the 9/10 is a little big for me but not too big not to wear. just rubs a little when i walk. i wish the straps were a little tighter because everything else seems to be the right size. still very pretty and i like them. great pricing too
246818	i really like this top. it is a bit more snug of a fit then is shown in the picture. the material it thicker than i thought as well-- not a bad thing.
246977	i just got these yesterday, my first pair. the color is amazing, they fit perfectly (i wear size 8, and bought size 8) i wore without socks to work and they were not only comfortable but they didn't rip up the backs of my ankles. highly recommend these shoes!
246989	i love this one as well, i wear it more often than the other watches i have purchased.the band is very comfortable as it is rubber, and the watch itselh is pretty accurate.
247036	i ordered the black in a large. my normal dress size is either a 12 or a 14, so i might normally have gone with an xl as i didn't want a dress with too much cling, but following the listed measurements i'm glad i went with the large. it fits perfectly. definitely go by the measurements that are listed, otherwise you'll risk not getting the right size or something that doesn't fit right (like one of the other not so satisfied reviewers).you can wear it as either a one shoulder or an off shoulder dress - either way it looks great. the material is nice. its thin but not so thin you have to worry about stuff like bra or panty lines. if you get the right maxi-dress, in the right print or color that fits your body right, you can dress it up or down. you could dress it up as an evening dress or down as a summer dress. which is exactly what i wanted. i'd looked around quite a bit and resigned to the fact that i'd probably have to pay a higher price than i had originally budgeted, but then i found this.seriously. for the price, you can't beat it. really good quality. you can wear it a bunch of different ways for a bunch of different looks. i may eventually own this dress in a number of different colors, that's how much i love it. i'll admit, though. buying the white is probably not the best idea considering the material. that's a risk you take when you buy white online without trying it on.anyway. i'm extremely happy and satisfied with my purchase. its not a to-die-for-amazing piece, but that's not what i was expecting when i ordered it. i got exactly what i was expecting and i'm in love with it.
247066	cute buy! , very thin, seems fragile, be careful! took the advice of some customers saying to buy a half size up because of the small size, and i did, but it was still kinda tight, but i would rather not return them, too complicated, but other than that theyre cute!but if you want something more sturdy and comfy:i bought t strap flats like these from the brand called breckelle here too, on amazon, and i have to say, they are cheaper and look way more than what you payed for! very comfy and sturdy!here's the link:breckelles cherry-12 ballet ballet-flatsthey are definitely more than what you payed for, i got them in black and they fit as expected, very comfy!
247134	i have short gray hair and this looks great. my gray shows through the dark brown and shows off the knitted tecture. really fun to wear. looks old fashioned.
247158	i love this under my things when out and working or snowblowing. it fit great and just feels so good on.
247170	this scarf is the perfect length, fullness, is super soft, and very nicely priced. i purchased the blue and another in light red. these would be cute with so many different outfits, imagination will figure out one use. but yes, lovely scarves.
247222	i am 5'8 at 170 pounds and curvy.  i ordered a medium and it fits very snug.  the rouching (spell check) can be moved up or down, which works because i pulled it to the middle to get rid of my slight muffin top and it worked wonders.  there is some spandex which i was wondering about considering that its 100% polyester.  the color is just like the photo. (i ordered teal)
247243	as the reviews have stressed this piece does run very small i got it one size bigger and wished i had gone two sizes bigger, it's snug.
247291	better than ones i can purchase here in stores.super value, they make my earring gifts look even more special.
247348	skechers women's go walk 2-axis fashion sneaker,black is a newer style for skechers as they are less loafer like than their older styles.  they are as comfy as can be with the soft padding and the soft fabric top.  the sole is cushioned extremely well and do great on my tile floors around the house.  they go with capris or jeans- just about anything.  i bought my mother a pair also as she has trouble fitting her long toes but these fit her perfectly and feel good for her around her tiled house or for shopping -etc.  my feet have some problems with pronation and a low arch.  skechers do not help with foot problems except for the excellent cushioning.  i have several pairs of skechers and love them all.  i still wear my good sneakers for food shopping or walking the dog for 45 minutes.  i wear my skechers every where else. what would it take to fit in some arch support when made?  i recently bought the skechers in leather- skechers go walk undercover, and these seem to have much better support so check these out.  they are not as pretty as these.
247370	after having knee surgery my mom purchased these skechers go walk shoes for me. i need ergonomically comfortable shoes that are easy on my knees for walking yet that look fashionable enough to wear everyday. i am usually brand loyal to merrell shoes, which i love. i have owned skechers before, and while they are a fine sneaker for most people, i really didn't find them to be easy enough on my weak knee for long walks. these skechers go walk shoes, however, changed my opinion of sketchers shoes!1) they are so cushy - i live in nyc and can walk for miles in these shoes without aggravating my knee. the soft rubber sole seems to provide a slight spring to my step. and the shoe hugs my feeet comfortably.2) they fit true to size- i ordered my typical size and they fit perfectly. they are comfortable and not too tight. yet, i can still easily and quickly slip them on and off. also, my foot does not slide around in them when i walk. they are probably the best fitting slip on shoe that i have ever owned.3) they wash and wear nicely - i have them in black and they don't attract dirt. however, since i don't wear socks with them i have tossed them in the washing machine to clean them and they have come out perfectly clean while still retaining their original shape and fit.in sum, i was very skeptical that a slip on shoe made by skechers could be ergonomically designed well enough to allow for pain free walking with my bad knee. however, skechers go walk shoes are amazing! they are cushy, with a great fit and a fashionable look. i am impressed that they still look and feel great despite almost daily use. i highly recommend them for anyone that wants a comfortable and nice looking slip on walking shoe.
247405	bought these primarily for the color combo, but hoping they would be as comfortable as my other go run2's and go walk 2's. and they are! if your feet hurt, give them a rest with some of the skechers go walk/go run line models. i still may have to undergo foot surgery on my right foot, but these skechers are the only way i can walk with comfort until then. i have replaced almost all my shoes with skechers go run 2's and go walk 2's; they are all i wear.
247409	cannot wait to buy another pair.  love these shoes. light weight, fun colors but sturdy enough to take the pounding my 12 hour shifts give them.
247467	do not buy! it is cheap plastic and i threw my money out the window. i bought five of these type rings on reviewers responses in different sizes and colors. it looks best on the pointer finger because of it's size but the stone is misaligned or samller then it should be. it is meant to be put in gumball machines.
247514	these men's briefs are great except for the sizing. i normally wear larges, and can even wear xl in some underwear brands. i ordered a large, and it was so big that i feel that i might have to go down 1-2 whole sizes. i plan to reorder and try a smaller size. if i can get the sizing figured out, i think i'll be happy. the fabric is very soft and light weight. nice and sexy underwear for men of any shape or size! i'd recommend these to any man! just keep in mind that you might want to order a smaller size than your average underwear size.
247549	just got these merrell decora chant winter boots and find them to be attractive in a functional kind of way.  nice looking black suede.  they have great tread for those who are looking for plenty of traction in a winter boot (i for one don't want to be slipping on ice!)  they are mid calf length and have a side zipper which allows easy access, a plus.  i have a pretty high arch, and found these fairly easy to get on and off.  they are warm and snug and feel good to walk in.  i wear a size 10 (euro 41) and purchased these in a size 42 and they fit just fine.
247555	the ring is nice but smaller than the pic shows , if  you are  a petite person and like small rings then this is perfect
247559	this ring truly is beautiful, although the picture is a bit deceiving by making the ring look huge! it's actually quite petite but not too petite. you can tell by the band that it is fake but only if you were wearing it. overall this ring is gorgeous!
247597	these shoes were even cuter in person than online, but for a person who does not wear heels, they are uncomfortable and a bit tight
247603	i have owned a pair of encore ice clogs for several years. while the shoe is very comfortable, it made my feet look so wide, more like two boxes rather than shoes. i wore these around the house as indoor only shoes because of the unattractive way they made my feet look.so when i considered ordering the encore nova crystal, i was hesitant. i finally decided after a careful examination of all the pictures of both shoes that these did not appear to be as bulky as the encore ice. i am very happy i took a chance on this shoes.they are a little more fitted than my other merrell clogs, but will likely stretch out once the plush lining flattens with wear. or i can stretch them a little with shoe stretchers. regardless, i like the look and feel of the nova crystal very much. i like them well enough to order another pair, in black this time.i have many pairs of merrell clogs, mules and sandals. they are my &#34;go to&#34; shoes for maximum comfort, for my feet as well as back and knees.
247619	i have 5 pairs of merrell encore shoes and this time i went with the fur lined ones since its getting cold outside and they look so comfy. i have worn them 4 times now all day and i don't have a single complaint.the color is a bright grey which i like, its different then my usual black or brown merrells. they fit just like the others without the fur lining, but are nice and toasty. they are soft lined and make my feet nice and warm.i will be purchasing them in a few other colors as well, they fit like a glove. a glove for my feet! :)
247640	i tried a pair of merrells on ina sporting good stores and opted for the 8.5. the shoes were too short when i walked in them.  i liked the weight of them, the way they looked--everything except the sticker shock when i had to return them to a shoe store in tuscaloosa, alabama, $ 13.85 to ship ups in the exact packaging they arrived in. i reordered the shoe in blue/ turquoise from another supplier who did pay return postage. my great shoes cost me a great deal more than they should have.  caveat emptor: let the buyer beware...and check for return shipping.
247652	the item is nice and fit perfect, it will do go for sleeve less dresses. nice material too, real nice
247660	this sun shades is the perfect fit. the size , the color , its all blended well together.i chose it because of the design and it works!!! will recommend to all my friends.
247700	the watch was purchased because it was large enough to read for this senior citizen to read and keep accurate time.  very attractive to wear to work.  our break rooms do not have accurate clocks to return to work at the correct time.  i set the watch to computer time and now have no difficulty returning to my desk when i need to be there.  could have bought  a cheaper large watch, but i questioned the time keeping abilities of a $10.00 instrument.  have received numerous compliments regarding this watch.  love the value that amazon provided on this item.  have recommended amazon for the great value when a fellow employee wanted to purchase one for himself.
247745	this is a very nice sandals but i can't wear it because it run big,i am a size 6 and it's somewhat big for my foot
247786	given the price, i shouldn't be surprised, but the quality is really really poor. i liked the shape from the image, but when it arrived it just looked and felt cheap, and had an outsized pink-colored flower button attached. just no.
247820	i get lots of compliments on this.  perfect size makes you feel skinny and trendy in a sweater!  thank you!
247824	beautiful! stunning! gorgeous! that is how my girlfriend looks when she wears this!  this sweater hugs her like a glove in all the right spots while being chunky and super comfy for her at the same time.  i love when she wears it and did i mention its a beautiful sweater that makes her look beautiful?!
247849	i was going by the heavy cotton headline and this was anything but heavy.  it had the feeling of a lightweight undershirt.  i ordered a xxl because i knew it would shrink and i wanted a loose fitting t-shirt.  the xxl was more like a large and more like a medium after being washed.  i will give this to someone as it's a bit of a hassle to return it.  not impressed.
247859	this is a good dress for the price.  it can be worn for shopping, travel, beach, just about anywhere.  the fit is loose so you don't have to worry about panty lines or bloated stomachs and you could even wear tights or leggings under it.  i am 5'2&#34;, 125 lbs, athletic build, size 4 and i ordered the small for a good fit.
247955	it is nice and i like the color, sizing is ok, but it seems a bit too short. so thats the only issue for me, so i have to really choose carefully what im going to wear it with.
248015	i was unsure about it at first because of the collar.  i didn't want to look costumey, as i bought it for every day wear.  after wearing it out, i now love this dress, and i've received many compliments when i wear it.  i got the 4x and the dress fits very comfortably until you put the belt on.  i don't know what these guys are thinking, but the holes for the belt make the dress painfully uncomfortable.  it just doesn't fit the size of the dress.  i chucked it and got a wide red belt to go with it instead, which i think breaks up the dress nicely.  another downside to the dress is that the zipper is shoddy.  on two separate occasions the zipper started to undo from the bottom.  it's not a permanent problem, you just have to unzip and rezip, but it certainly can cause embarrassment.
248195	this necklace is thin but beautiful and shiny, the silver makes it looks like shiny little diamonds. i love the style is nicely twisted and that's what's makes it look very shiny. love the shine silver bright color. thank you!
248205	this heel looks great with jeans and dress pants.  they are comfortable right out of the box as i expect from clarks.  i added an insole just as i do with most of my shoes.
248339	i am so in love with these shoes.  they fit great, look great and are made very well.  the price is great.  i am so satisfied with these boots, they are my favorite pair of shoes.
248341	i love my boots. the color is different than the picture. it is more gray or very weathered black, but they fit great and look great. i get many compliments and wear them all the time.
248398	colors not as pictured, is mostly blue flowers than yellows so, its o.k but not superb. fit o.k and is confy
248476	i bought this for my sons girlfriend.  amazing!!! just as described.  actually the picture doesn't do justice to the actual ring.  its beautiful.  i can't wait to buy more from jewelry by marcus.
248562	this could pass for a piece of real jewelry.  the sizing was accurate and the ring is lightweight.  very pleased.
248565	i ordered this because it was so pretty. the stones are beautifully cut and set. it is too large and the stones do not look like genuine diamonds. my daughter kept the ring because she thought it was a nice fashion ring. i prefer simulated diamonds due to the conflicts and inhumane treatment to diamond miners. i feel we all share responsibility when making a purchase. the ring is really pretty and sparkly, i really like the idea of stainless steel too.
248593	so i read all the reviews first and i am glad i did the shoes do fit smaller. i am a 7 and i got a 6 and they fit perfect! i was a little bummed that the zipper on one shoe doesnt work the best. i am just not going to unzip it anymore! i love how they look and feel. wore them in a snow storm and was impressed my feet didnt freeze. good buy!
248619	i bought this for my teen daughter, she loves the design.  she is comfortable with this since she isn't showing too much skin and it fits her beautifully.
248661	bought these for my daughter.  they were so inexpensive i thought she might report they are uncomfortable, but she really likes them and has been wearing them every day since receiving them.
248685	these were really nice - however, i encountered the same problem as another reviewer noted.  the posts were very bent when they arrived, because the earrings were not even in a box - they were just placed in an envelope that was not well padded.  i tried straightening them out and succeeded for the most part, though the posts are still slightly bent/not perfectly straight.  such a shame, since the earrings themselves were pretty - nice color and size.  i would have given a 5 if it were not for the bent posts.i hope the seller can package them better (in a box or some other way that ensure the posts do not get bent) for future buyers.
248706	i took the advice of one of the reviewers here, saying that this shoe runs big, so i ordered the next size down, but it turned out to be too small!this shoe runs true to size.  now i have to reorder them.
248747	i don't like foam in bras for young people, and i purchased this for a teen.  oh well...i may need to read the details more - but don't remember there being a statement regarding the 'foam.'  young people don't need this, and i have concerns for the health effects of foam against the skin.
248790	i like that these are thin with a good stretch, it means they can hug my hips pretty well, but not smoosh my breasts.i am satisfied by the quality of the tank material, but the trim and stitching could be better.  the ribbon trim and the stick threads look a little cheap.
248802	"they're very thin, so perfect for layering or wearing alone on those hot summer days. these camisoles, like the active basic tees, are super soft, wash well (without shrinking), and are true to the color pictured. you can't go wrong having a few of these in your closet.update: i finally encountered a color that was not true to what was pictured... it's the ""solid tan nude"" and there's nothing nude about it. whereas the picture looks grayish-tan, it's actually just decidedly tan, and a yellow-toned one at that. if you're trying to match something, don't rely on what you see on the screen, as i did."
248931	followed size guidelines but shoe was still much too big. also very heavy-- uncomfortable to wear. returned with no problem.
248962	i love these boots!!! they're so cute and so comfortablethey're very true to size and i wear them all the time
248990	my son isn't able to tie a shoe, but as kids get older it is harder and harder to find nice looking velcro shoes. he needed athletic shoes for gym and needed to put them on independently. i replaced the original laces with these...voila! he is very happy and so am i!
248992	i just had hip replacement surgery, and i won't be able to reach down to tie shoelaces for a few months, so i wanted to turn my lace-up sneakers into slip-ons. these work great. i bought them in red, orange, yellow and tan. they are 45 inches long, so they don't skimp on length. i like them very much.
249026	i like the fit as well as the shimmer of the leggings and the high waist is nice for anti-muffin top! :)
249089	i gave it a 4 because it looks fake/weird when its upclose and i also needed to order another one and return the last one i had bc a stone was missing. looks weird bc the stones are glued randomly (not neatly) to the white background.overall, looks so great from a far and ppl are always complimenting it. looks great in photos. just dont look toooo close ;)
249253	these are great.  really pretty and soft.  great quality for pajamas.  great to wear all day.....i love to sit around early evening in pretty pajamas
249325	i probably would not buy another pair with the closed heel. it hits just in the wrong part of my achilles tendon. i will try to soften the part that sticks up. otherwise, the color is very nice. due to foot issues, i have to wear birkenstock, so it's nice to have a different pair.
249340	in this age of uploads and downloads it is nice to have a peice of yesterday. it keeps perfect time (if you remember to wind it) and the fact that it has the &#34;steampunk&#34; finish is a beautiful touch. i have received several compliments from people usually asking if it was a family heirloom. i the frount and back allow you to see the inner workings of the watch and the gears in motion. and the price? $19.90 delivered? a steal. very pleased..
249363	i bought it for my daughter, she liked it . and it really looks pretty, good design, and light weight.
249391	i've enjoyed these, glad they are sterling silver so i can wear them all the time.  i have multiple holes, so i get to pick the sizes, i've actually purchased 2 of these sets so my daughter can use them too.
249401	i usually wear a medium but since this was on sale the only size available was an xl. there is no way that is true to size. it fits like a medium would. surprised me b/c i own pants from the same brand and size 9 fits true to size. definitely a layering piece since it is very sheer.
249411	this purse is perfect. i ordered the khaki and it looks great with any casual outfit. the inside lining is red which i did not expect but was very happy to find it wasn't a black abyss. the inside lining is also thick, like a canvas fabric, and stitched together very well, as the rest of the bag. the leather also has been very durable and hasn't scuffed or scratched anywhere with daily abuse. the studs are also great quality, all still completely gold and secure in place. the strap is the perfect length to put on one shoulder or as a cross-body bag; i am 5'2. it also doesn't constantly fall off my shoulder as some other past shoulder bags.my clutch wallet did not fit in this purse so i transferred my wallet contents into a smaller wallet, which i don't mind. i carry my phone, a box of altoids, some pens, chapstick, powder and my wallet with a good amount of extra room left. the outside zippered pocket is great to protect and grab my keys quick. it's also a good size pocket, going to the bottom of the purse so you can fit more than just your lipstick. totally in love with this purse, great quality at a great price and would definitely recommend.
249502	if it had the notch out cover over the time like in the square model, and a black band it would almost be just like niobes watch in the matrix reloaded.
249530	this is a very appealing t-shirt that fits great and is very comfortable.  unlike most clothing this shirt is free of sewed-in labels that i really like.  it is always a nuisance to have to cut them out on new clothing.  the shirt is great for wearing with levi's jeans.
249569	i ordered two black leggings in large. one fit okay just have to get used to the low waist. the second one seemed like it was a size smaller although it was marked large. i'll probably give it away. i have no problem with the thickness of the fabric.
249613	...but this is definitely not a plus size dress. it is very disappointing, because i was really looking forward to wearing this.
249638	these little booties are like walking on marshmallows. they are so comfy and also have nice support. i wear them without socks and here in the cold chicago area my feet remain toasty warm. very pleased with these and highly recommend.
249654	although it took several attempts to get the right size (i am size 10 and had to by xxl) these look so nice and truly take of inches from the waist.
249661	so disappointed..item looks nothing like what was pictured..jean material more of a bustier thsn a corset..xl was a small really im a size 12 and could not even fasten...waste of money...buyer beware
249672	great for the price, fit was accurate, and overall the faux leather is great looking! looks like real leather, and it honestly breathed pretty well taking that it is an artificial material. wore it for a wonder woman costume, will now wear it for other stuff too!
249681	"i've had my pebble for about 5 months now and i don't know how i lived without it. the most useful aspect of the pebble watch is as a triage device for your messages and calls. scenario: you texted something to your girlfriend 10 minutes ago. now your phone is in your pocket and your phone alerts you to a new message. is it your mom with some urgent family news? is it your boss saying you need to call him immediately? so you set down your coffee, fumble in your pocket, pull out your phone and unlock it to find- it's a text from your girlfriend that says ""lol"".so what the pebble does is let you know immediately what the text is, what your new email is, who is calling you etc. so that you know if it's something you need to deal with immediately or that warrants a response.i know what you're saying, ""but taking your phone out of your pocket or purse only takes like 7 seconds...""  true, but how many text messages do you get a year? thirty per day would be around ten thousand per year. how many emails do you get? what about tweets or facebook messages? reminder and calendar alerts? multiply that times 7 seconds and you can see how useful pebble really is.also, the pebble has vibration, so if you are in a meeting, or in class, you can simply glance at your wrist to read your messages, without the conspicuous rudeness of pulling out your phone and reading it while someone is speaking to you.of course, pebble also has apps that can do other stuff: control your music, find your phone, etc. with the upcoming version 2.0 firmware apps will be able to do way more. and of course there are the hundreds of cool watch faces to choose from so the look of your pebble stays fresh.my one negative on the watch is that it isn't very scratch resistant. if you get a pebble, you should really get a clear screen protector from places like gadgetwraps."
249685	i purchased the white at a cool $245. over 100 bucks above the other pebble colors, but i had a gift card and, well, why not, i really wanted the white. it arrived promptly, which is part of the great amazon prime service. other than that, my experience was not good. the item looks cheap. it is what it is and that is cheap. it looks like a casio from the 80's. nothing in the watch reflects the price, not even at the lower msrp. i consider myself somewhat of a tech geek, and this product is just ok. it is very basic, but it does do what is promised - vibrates to indicate text or calls. and allows you to change the faces, which is pretty cool except that the display looks so cheap that the designs don't really shine. i will wait until the technology is more developed to get a unit with more functionality. not a bad product but really overpriced. this one is going back.
249694	just so you are aware this is not the indestructible version of the pebble.  they are charging almost twice the retail price for the version that is easily destructible.
249704	i bought this as a gift for a techy-  it was a hit at first&#8230;.  but then upon closer inspection it kind of felt cheap and basic.  even as a watch seemed clunky and crappy.  once it was turned on - it felt super basic and could tell it would be hard to read if you were out or in a darker place.  font is small and it didnt seem to work to great when texting the person or giving any info.  the smiles soon wore off and my awesome gift fell flat.  now still searching for something cool to replace it with.  may be good for some- but not my techy&#8230;..
249710	i had been considering the meta watch over the pebble for pure aesthetics but finally decided the pebble is superior and bought mine little did i expect pebble to release the metal version of their pebble the day after i placed my order. i decided to stay with this pebble and i am loving it. it can do way more then any other watch i've ever owned its smaller then i thought it would be and it is light weight. i love the apps and watch faces that you can change out given you can only put 8 on at a time of both apps and watch faces combined. the ability to make custom watch faces is also very nice and have a couple already made. the watch is very light weigh all things considered being used to the metal watches. i got this as a replacement to my 130 dollar invicta i got from kholes and let me say i love it even if it looks a little sportish i might buy a cheap metal band after i get my pay check. one thing is for certain get the smart watch+ app for ios users it is very useful in a lot of areas and get the free run keeper app. also i can't wait for the pebble app store app to come out for ios users like myself. it was easy to learn how to navigate also and is very easy to use. it is super light weight.
249714	the hinges on this watch insure a secure fit and it looks beautiful. the face is a little small and difficult to read in low light.
249765	these are the perfect combination of features (for me) for driving.  here's why.thanks to lasik i don't need glasses to drive but do need reading glasses to catch details on my gps or cell phone.  that meant fumbling between two pair of glasses.  even when done sitting at a stop light that was a real pain.with these glasses i can see to drive and glance down at my gps without any fumbling.  as an added bonus, they are not polarized.  that's good because at least with my car built-in gps and iphone screen using polarized glasses interfered with the images being displayed.beyond that, these glasses are light, comfortable, and have a quality look and feel.  they fit my &#34;slightly larger than average&#34; face well without looking overly huge.  finally, they come with a very nice semi-rigid, zipper case which includes a heavy duty clip and also a micro-fiber cleaning cloth.
249793	i have apparently gained weight. i loved the look of this but i ordered a size that usually fits. sadly this did not. i donated it to the good will. some lucky girl will be pleased with such a pretty dress.
249879	i did not know what to expect.  when ordering online items online, the items do not always look and feel as expected.  however, i am pleased with this shirt.  i hope they still have this shirt in the other color i saw.  i would recommend this shirt.
249933	this 36c fits more like a 34a - useless to me if i want to actually breathe while i want to work out.  also the straps come through the hole and velcro to themselves... like a nursing bra...not sure what that's all about but definite buyers remorse but returning stuff online is such a hassle.
249959	i have a very small rib cage and a large bust. this bra did not fit well at all. the front closure did not stay level, causing the plastic to dig into my skin. i returned my item. it might work well for smaller busts.
249960	very comfortable. it was worth weighting for. i am a larger chested person and to get a bra at this price is nice. the cups are a bit stretchy witch is good.
250043	this is the coolest watch i have ever had. the tap to 8 takes some getting used to. my problem was mis-interpreting what they meant by &#34;tap&#34;. actually proper skin contact will suffice. you have to break the field or whatever it takes to activate a touch activated device like this, but i found that my thumb making contact worked great. now, i have a wonderful conversation starter. it is truly unique and looks very futuristic when it's operating. i say get this and take their breaths away. now...if it only came in a rectangular shape, i'd buy several dozen as gifts!
250046	it was nice, although somewhat thin, i purchased to wear to work, but again somewhat thin, would defintely need something underneat, and if you have hip, this sucker rides hard  lol no bueno for work, and it was not super tight, i got a size large and needed a medium.
250079	very cute!  accurate description, and i love amazon prime free and fast shipping.  i really like the two purses in one idea!  wish all purses came that way! another christmas gift knocked out!
250154	i read it run small so i bought a xl. the sleeves are just fitting but the bodice is way too large!  i will give it to my sister.
250166	"i received this necklace free for review, and the timing couldn't have been better-- i recently bought a ""living locket"" (like the origami owl line), which is a fairly heavy locket with charms inside. i loved the locket, but hated the chain that came with it, which looked cheap and gaudy. i tried a different figaro chain i own, but the locket didn't hang properly... it needed to be able to move freely so it could sit right in the middle. this snake chain is perfect for it.my biggest concern when i buy chains like this is the tangle-and-kink factor-- will it get tangled in my hair, and will the chain kink up? i'm glad to say that it's been smooth sailing. it's not getting caught in my hair, and it feels smooth and sturdy. it's thin enough to look delicate, but it's strong. i think it's a great find."
250216	i was afraid to try these but decided to give them a go and just have fallen in love with them. they are so cute from every angle, look wonderful with big tops and cropped tight ones! they are so comfortable and just fit right in with my wish to look a bit different!
250229	i have many medium-size hobo-style bags that i switch back & forth, and the single zipper pocket held most of my small items and was about to rip off from the volume and weight. this organizer is incredible, helping me empty that overstuffed pocket out into dainty little compartments so things are organized and unforgotten. the zippered pockets and main compartment are wide enough to hold half-letter size paper as well as #10 envelopes. i no longer have to dig around for my lip balm or a pen. it now only takes 30 seconds to change handbags, and i would highly recommend this to any other woman who carries her whole world in her purse.
250235	had to relace the corset. i like the bow at the bottom...i think it is supposed to be that way. i wasn't sure what size to buy so i got the 4x. it fits reasonable well in the ribs but the lower half can't be cinched. it won't get tight no matter what. the bustier feature is useless since there is no way to order a cup size. my boobs (b to c) were either painfully mashed or spilling over the top. not attractive. match that with the two triangles sticking out above my belly button and it really just looks odd. it is very good quality and i will wear it but it will have to be matched with dresses that have a narrow cut in the waist to help press it in at the bottom.
250267	i love this scarf!! the color and size is great! the quality isn't the best of the best, but for the price...wow! if you're careful and hand wash it, it should last you awhile.
250431	this necklace is cute but the flower is more of a peach color then cream. the necklace had rust on a spot before i wore it. i am afraid to wear it because i do not know it is safe?
250528	i always like skechers, but this time, i really don't like it. it doesn't fit me. it is tighter than my size. it is really painful when i wear it.  :s
250572	i wanted a 24 inch long silver necklace to transfer my braceelet charms to,  but evidently the 24 inch one wasn't available and so now i have to use two extenders to make it long eneough.  i was disappointed and wish the longer one had been available as advertised.  it's pretty, though and i will keep this one.flo philips
250639	these are the most comfortable, light weight shoes i've ever had! i have several pairs of these shoes and i love them!
250764	i was ecstatic to find a burgundy cardigan of this style. i was pleasantly surprised to find how thick the material was for the price. it's a perfect fit, and don't be off put by my statement of being made of thick material (to elaborate - it is made of quality material; it is thick enough to be warm, but not heavy or cumbersome). i have worn this with both a long sleeve shirt and a cami. it looked incredible with both. the sleeves are fitted, but not tight. it is comfortable and has become a quick staple in my wardrobe...and not just for the autumn/winter months.
250819	"my daughter and i were a bit disappointed with this kit. first off the nail polish is super tiny. but also it has a different sort of smell to it. it kind of reminds me of glue. it is also somewhat clear and leaves just a slight lavender tint to your fingernails which didn't really look that pretty. perhaps a slight pink tint would have looked a little ""healthier."" (the purple tint made me think of hands that are way too cold.) anyways, she only did a few nails and then wiped it off. it didn't seem like regular nail polish and neither of us liked the hue.next is the lotion it comes with. it was not easy to open and it also was not pleasant in smell. it reminded me of special ""unscented"" lotionals made for sensitive skin or something. you know how sometimes those have a slight, sort of almost medicinal scent to them? or like the smell of phisoderm facewash. but you are suppose to add some ""pretty"" fragrance to it that the kit comes with and some color dye. neither of us liked the smell of the fragrance. and i don't understand why we'd want to put artificial dye in a nice pure white lotion. when i opened the fragrance, the top/dropper part came right out with the cap and spilt a bit, so that was not thrilling. we didn't bother trying to open the dye.the one thing my daughter had fun with was the crystal mud. it is in a bottle and looks almost like pink sand or pop rocks. you mix a small amount with water and it turns into a sort of slushy gel to soak your fingers and fingernails in. my daughter had fun with this, and also again when her friend came over. it does have a neat, relaxing feel to it. and there is enough to make it a few more times. and my daughter kept the nail buff that comes in the kit. but that was it. everything else was disappointing. you could have more fun going to the dollar store or drug store and buying a bottle of regular nail polish and small tube of hand lotion in a scent of your choice and putting it in a little dollar store basket or gift bag."
250841	i loved the white because it goes with everything, but overall i am very pleased!!!  i want more colors lol!!!!
250852	to start, i am 95 pounds, so i thought that even though this was an xs, it would still fit me.the panties were pretty tight and uncomfortable to wear, but still looked cute on.the top was pretty small in the chest area as well, and i'm pretty small up there. it doesn't look as nice as the photo shows, but it still looks alright.if i were to get this again, i would definitely search around for a bigger size.
250862	i probably should have read through the whole description before purchasing. i thought this was more of a soft fabric but i'd say it's more of a rayon blouse fabric. i kept it, who knows maybe i'll find somewhere to wear it but haven't yet.
250872	this is a really nice blouse.  i really like it and it looks really good with a pair of jeans
250877	nice but way way to small. still looking for someone just to give it too. my daughter wears size xs i ordered med it fit her but she said she would never wear it.
250887	i love this top - it's the 4th or 5th allegra k item i've purchased. they're not meant to last or hold up to long wear, which is why they're inexpensive, but i like having new lightweight tops every summer so as long as it lasts through a few months i'm happy. i've already washed this one twice (cold water, hang dry) and it still looks great. i don't like to iron so i throw it in the dryer on a low setting while it's damp to unwrinkle the garment. looks great over a tank top with jeans and i've worn it with cropped black pants to the office as well.
250894	i ordered this in white and absolutely loved it!  the material in the white is different than the black.  i wish the black was the same as it is not as comfortable.  i still really like the shirt but it is a little smaller than the white and without the give of the material, it makes it a little uncomfortable to wear.  i guess i could shed a few pounds or order the next size up!  very cute cute though!
250914	thisis a gift for someone who needs some up to date clothes and she will rock it with a scarfalways likes my gifts for xmas
250915	this shirt is so cute and comfy i love it, only one thing, it wrinkles easily! i hate wrinkles! they look so sloppy!!
250925	the arms seem to be a little small but my arms are big and im still loosing wheight so i know i love this blouse!!! its so gorgeous and i love it bc it's very unique. excellent quality i can't wait to show this off this summer!!! and...yessss i would highly reccomend this and they have other very unique styles. it is a must have!!!! order up people!!! lol these tops absolutly rock!!!! i give this a +10!!!!! being the very best i have!!!tyvm!!! :) i will be back for more unique styles!!! :)tyvmval b.
250942	looks like the picture, fits well.  i wear an 18/20 in most clothes with a 42 d bust. i bought the 18 and it was pretty much perfect. could have been just a little bit looser so an undershirt wasn't as noticeable but it works.  fabric is nice and soft and the shirt is comfortable and cute.
250977	these are your standard long-sleeved bodysuits (i call them undershirts).  i use these as an undershirt as well as a pajama top (paired with cotton pants) when the lo doesn't need something warmer.  they didn't shrink in the wash/dryer which is good.  there is room to grow which is also nice.
250979	fits my 10 week old wonderfully, but these definitely won't fit after 14 weeks or so. won't fit for months 4-6 for my daughter, who is in 50th percentile for height and weight.
250982	we use these as undershirts during the winter for our baby girl. the quality is nice and the fit is as expected. i'll be ordering the next size up when the time comes!
251087	"ok.  this cardigan is a mixed bag. the problems:1)  the ""t-shirt"" fabric advertsied on its title isn't accurate.  i don't have any t-shirts that have spandex in them.  when i picked it up, i knew immediately it wasn't all cotton.  there is something about 100% cotton;  it breathes;  it softens with age which is why it's everybody's favorite casual apparel.  so, no, it doesn't have that nice soft cotton feel to it that i was expecting.2)  the buttonholes aren't cut properly on the front.  ladies are complaining left and right that it won't close properly.  this is why.  a button hole placed vertically on an opening means the button is constantly pulling the button hole wider and it means the button will pull out.  so ladies, when you buy a garment with buttonholes, notice which way the buttonholes are placed.  i only buttoned this sweater once while i tried it on and immediately took it off.  the buttonholes are already gaping.3)  i have a pretty good hunch that this fabric will pull and snag in short time.the good points:1)  the overall sizing is good;  the sleeves are truly 3/4 length.2)  the style is just too cute;  ladies were complaining about the neck being too low;  but i was expecting to wear a tee under it.3)  the colors are cute except and true to description.i got two:  when i like something i usually get them in a couple different colors;  i'm returning these.  the quality of fabric is not satisfactory and the improperly constructed buttonholes make it a problem."
251116	i was a bit worried about this top, but i've ordered other allegra k items and have been satisfied, and this was no exception. i ordered size large, i wear size large in most us-based clothing companies, and it was the right size for me. haven't washed it yet, but i'll just air-dry it to avoid shrinkage (which the tag recommends anyway). the all-over print skull hides my belly without being obvious, the back covers my butt without sticking out in some awkward way, and from the side, i still have a nice silhouette without looking like i'm wearing a giant black trash-bag. overall, a really nicely-shaped over-sized shirt--something hard to find if you're a &#34;size large.&#34;
251134	didn't fit accross my top, i don't have wide shoulders but it just feels funny.shipping back to china too expensivegave away to smaller friendshes happy with it
251163	this pack has a really nice grab bag. i think it was more boyshorts. 4 pairs of boy shorts, two thongs and two others. all really cute and she loved it. great little gift.
251181	this skirt is a great color and great fabric but the waistband is so tiny i actually thought the skirt was folded in half when i saw it!  if you wear anything larger than a medium, assume the waistband will be uncomfortably tight. for me, the skirt was even too small around the highest band, making the top poof out.  would be cute on a little person. anyone bigger than a 12 should pass on this one for sure.
251218	i hated this item! it was so cheaply made that it arrived with a hole in the back of the neck! i gave it away! i will never again purchase an item of this sort!
251247	this bikini looks just like the picture. the fabric is thin and the stitching seems a bit cheap. in any case it fits me, it looks cute and the price was awesome! so i'm keeping it. probably won't be wearing it around my in-laws, but for sure to go to the beach with hubby. sexy bikini!
251287	for the price these earrings are okay. they came before the estimated delivery time which is a plus. i've gotten compliments on them and they hold up pretty well on my ears.
251288	my review says it all, the snake shaped earring broke in three pieces when i tried to adjust the size, i was kind of disappointed because i really wanted that one.the other two (the non piercing dragon and the pierced style dragon) seem a little fragile too, luckily i didn't have to adjust them to get them to fit my ear.you can't really complain too much because the items were only .99, plus you do get the blue cable thingy that cats seem to like.
251301	right now i only have one to rate because the seller sent defective earrings! currently we are trying to work it out. they are asking for pics of the defective parts but not everyone has a digital cam! i only paid just over a dollar for these, and that's just what i got, one working earring! the earring that works though is pretty heavy on the ear but looks great if you can tolerate that weight!
251324	as expected, on time, right size, right quality for the price. kids are happy. item does not require additional comment.
251325	i just received my blazer and this is my second purchase from lookbookstore, i love the fit and it just stunning. i cant wait to wear and turn heads...lol
251364	love the shoe. had to send back. needed a more neutral color. i just need to get in black to love these as well
251383	these shoes are comfortable, fit well and were comfortable right away.  i have somewhat wide feet with a high instep so i was a bit concerned about how they would fit but they were fine.  if you don't have wide feet these might feel a bit loose.  the soles feel a tad less springy then the open toe &#34;flipflop&#34; style but they still can't be beat, and i wear these all day with virtually no back or knee pain.they're well constructed, arrived quickly and it good condition.  no complaints whatsoever, i'm a fan of fitflops!
251397	this ring is too cute. i love them. it took about a month to receive it but that's to be expected after all it is coming from china! will order again. the ring looks better in person than the picture.
251437	these tights are of good material and very comfortable. they were a decent price, and i like the design too!
251438	these leggings are awesome . they look just like the picture and i'm normally about a size 11/12 and they fit amazing!
251445	i got this borwn headband for my conservative office environment.  i have the fun pattern sweaty bands that i wear when i work out, but wanted something more &#34;vanilla&#34; for work.  these headbands really don't move.  i do power yoga, and am a big sweaty mess when i'm done.  my bangs/hair stay out of my face, and that headband doesn't more.  it's crazy.  all the other &#34;yoga&#34; headbands that you can buy at the upscale stores slide still, these stay put!  i love them
251496	it's a statement style of ring - everyone believes that it is genuine - it also elongates the finger. very nicely.
251521	my daughter's worn hers probably 6-8 times and we wash in the washer after each wearing. we love the outfit and she seems really comfy when she wears this. we've gotten many compliments.
251655	they look cool.  they wrap around so there is no reflections or wind coming in the sides.  previously he did not like sunglasses.  now he loves to wear them.  i am glad i bought them.
251708	this is a nice, light weight scarf that drapes like a slightly heavy gauze might.  good subtle color.  looks nice with jeans and a tweed blazer for the brit lit look.
251767	my wife enjoys me in these a whole lot. they have definitely paid for themselves. ;) quality for price seems good.
251769	looks and feels sexy!!! this product is not only fun to wear, but it also keeps you junk right up front .
251783	i thought it would be smaller than it was.  my fault, i should've read the dimensions.  so i cut it up and i made a very small purse out of it about 6&#34; wide. then i made an wrap to go around my ankles for a costume.
251786	purse looks like the picture. the strap is adjustable but a little flimsy for a purse strap. i carry a lot in my purse but it's holding up just fine. it's just too cute, i even bought boots to match.  i'll get another one when this thing bites the dust.
251849	i choosed 1oo% rating even though they were a little larger than a large should be after washing them they srink very little made the fit better i did recommend this priduct to my friends for a confortable fitting lounge pants
251904	great color:  rich and sparkly!  the earrings are a beautiful shade of blue and they have depth and clarity of color.  they match the pendant and look like they should sell for at least twice the price.  these earrings are easy to put on and i've never had trouble with the backs being too loose and separating from the earring - an unfortunate occurrence with other pairs of earrings.  i highly recommend these earrings and will probably be buying at least one other set as a holiday gift.
251908	"totally forgot about my high school reunion so i needed a dress fast. saw this was prime eligible and it was less that $20 so i said why the hell not. if i didn't like it, at least i didn't spend a lot of money. came in on time, didn't even try it on. ordered a large since i just had a baby and everything is a lot bigger than i'm used to lol. dress fits pretty darn amazing. only minor issue i had was it was a little big, just a little, underneath the armpit. who cares. it was beautiful over all. i felt beautiful, it hugged my curves really well. it was the perfect length. i'm 5'5"" and a total hourglass. well worth the price for me."
251931	i waited until someone received theirs before ordering mine. they were happy with theirs i'm not. 1st i wears a  us size 6. so i ordered a medium. should of gone with the small. 2nd the material is like a thick slip with way too much give...horribly cheap looking. so unless you order a size or 2 smaller it will not have that fitted/snug feel to it once u put it on. i would recommend you pass on this one.
251959	these pant was just perfect with the jacket. stylish and comfortable, just a great hook-up. the pants and jacket, you just can't beat.my brothers are envious. i will recommend this combo to everybody!the only problem was that gorilla that packed this shipment... no invoice and the pants and jacket was severely wrinkled. i will have to get them professional press before i can wear them out in public. can you help me out ?
252024	i loved these capris. they were my absolutely favorite for yoga and wearing out and about. however, because of the extensive wear, the seams between the thighs started to come apart after about 6 months (maybe less). this might be due to the wear and washing, but it wasn't because of the thighs rubbing. it was definitely seams coming undone.i would have bought another pair though if they still had them.
252084	great earrings. they were packaged nicely. all earrings and backing were accounted for. better quality than what the image shows.
252092	they have a retro-ish look i wanted and they fit well. the color is a little darker in person for the tan.
252093	very cute boots and surprisingly fit perfectly. i have narrow feet so they wrk very well. love them and plan on wearing them alot :-)
252097	i love these boots!  they are very cute and comfortable. the overlay tends to twist, so you have to straighten them out periodically, but that's fine with me.  also, one side tends to come untied, so i double-knotted the bow.
252126	it came a little after christmas, but that was the estimated arrival time. delivery wasn't quick, but around the holidays nothing is really that fast so it's understandable.my mom loves it. she comes home every day she wears it boasting about the compliments she received about it. fabric is nice. i haven't really gotten a good long look at it, but no complaints from the mother figure. overall, it was a great, if not belated, christmas present.
252172	my husband bought these for me for christmas.  i love them.  true, the zipper does not open them up all the way to the top but it does help you to get them on.  and i don't have skinny legs but i am able to get my pants in the boots.  i found a way on the internet to get the pants in the boots and them not being skinny pants.  hint:  fold the pants up around the bottom of your leg and put the sock over it to stay.  i did this with my boots when i was a younger woman in the 70s and i still like the look!they are comfortable and true to size.  i have had many wonderful comments on how nice they look.
252264	these are great!  they fit like leggings but look like jeans!  and thy yo up high enough that it helps with muffin top.
252270	i have seen these elsewhere for more. this looks great on!  i am taking it to the beach with me!
252314	otherwise its a nice lightweight sweater vest that i will wear quite a bit for nice occasions as well as golf.
252326	in case you didn't notice, these are scarves. they're cottony and small, not a huge scarf. you're getting exactly what you see, they're very long and very pretty. i can wrap my head in them or wear them around my neck.
252329	these scarves are very pretty. they are lightweight and not too bulky and i love all of the colors.  i would definitely recommend these scarves.
252343	not tight or scratchy at all.  lightweight material provides gentle smoothing, not firm support.  like the color, a rosy nude.
252356	let me start by saying i hate all compression products! every time i wiggle and worm myself into a $60 thigh/muffin top controller, i wonder why i don't just lose 10lbs, but apparently that's not in the cards.  that being said....these are wonderful! they are lightweight ( the other ones are so hot), they do not roll on the leg (you know how annoying that is!) and they smooth and shape!i am throwing away all the other (more expensive) ones i have, and buying only these!
252367	these are lightweight, non binding and super comfortable. the legs dont roll, they dont pinch and the quality is good. i initially bought one pair, then 3 more. order one size up though for a perfect fit.
252373	this is made out of very stretchy material that when taken out of th package, looks like 3&#34; wide. as you put it on, it stretches with your body but will remain completely snug fitting no matter what size you are.  also it is extremely see-through.  maybe good as an undergarment in cold weather or something you may consider wearing to bed.
252407	these are perfect to go with short dresses.  fit's very true to size.  wonderful for women who are pregnant because the waist band is not binding.
252420	i was worried about the color since most comments said they were straight up gray, not black, and i wanted a black boot, but i liked the styling enough to go for it. while definitely gray, they were really cute, comfortable, and fit well. i love the dark gray color and agree with another reviewer who said that the non-blackness was actually better so as to stand out from black leggings. definitely recommend.
252470	i love love love this waist cincher. it tightens as your abs contract and gives a better workout. i'm already needing a smaller size!
252475	my baby buckeye (former collegiate record holding athlete) wants to get back in shape after injury so she ordered this on my account. i asked her, for this review, does she like it? she replied &#34;marvelous!!!&#34;
252515	this one turned out to be a little darker than i expected, but still i can tell its purple and not onyx. any lighter and i guess it would be lavender, and if i had wanted a lavender ring then i wouldhave bought a lavender ring. it is purple, by crackety, and its gorgeous!
252527	4 stars this is pretty , but definitely looks fake. great for a gift for kids or young adults. only whole sizes.
252553	i guess you get what you pay for. nice to stack with other rings but i would not really recommend it, unless for a child maybe. looks kinda cheap
252557	i don't mind wearing costume or fashion jewelry that's well made or made to look like the real thing, so i was eager to receive this 'tanzanite' band. unfortunately, this ring looks like costume jewelry. haven't found an occasion to wear it yet and will probably find a young girl to pass it on to. wouldn't buy it again, in any of the colors.
252583	it looks exactly like in the picture and i must say is a cute model of swimsuit but is way to small and i cannot get in. is exactly how other reviews said too weird built. im 5.6 and 150 lb and no way to get in. for sure is gonna work for somebody very petite.
252605	i like the fabric and it arrived on time. the fit and cut of the dress is very nice. it is very flattering.
252611	got the pink /fuschia which is a nice summer clor. the dress fit fine and tho the material is only what youd expect for the price, it is not fliumsy nor see thru. the ties make it fit well adn the high- low hemline fit me just right. casual enough for the farmers market, but could take you into driks on the patio in the evening, depending on how you accesorize it. nice dress, good value.
252618	these are by far the most beautiful capri's i've ever worn. i have the caspian blue and the indigo colors. the design on them looks amazing. the caspian blue is my favorite. they are a flattering fit for the most part.i took away a star because:-both the caspian blue and the indigo colors show sweat. they turn black anywhere there is moisture. maybe choose the black color if you want to avoid this issue.-more likely to get camel toe with these capris than with the thicker compression-style capris by under armour.-at the waste line, these tend to dig in a little so it makes me look a tad more flabby than the compression style capris.
252632	i purchased these for a very cheap price and when they came i was pleasantly surprised at what high quality they are. the jewel looks nice and is very shiny and so is the rest of the earring. these are great for all ages because of how nice they look. not too big & or chunky. i will be giving them as a gift to my sister (18) but would like to keep them for myself (26). highly recommend.
252765	i was a littel worried based on some previous reviews regardin sizing issues, they are very stretchy and a lot of give so i would say they fit true to size and will give if you are little larger than the chart recommends you ought to be fine.
252889	these look amazing!  these will make your lady (or yourself) look amazing.  great fit, comfortable and sexy.  great for the price and well made.  a very satisfied purchaser!
252893	they seemed to be made very cheap the pair i bought had a tear in them i couldn't send them back because it cost more to send them back than they cost.
252919	this would be the one!  i absolutely love this shirt!! this shirt has become a defintite favorite.  it looks with good with everything, not kidding.  i wore this with a skirt one day, pants another and even jean shorts and wow... very flattering, very comfortable and the draping is extremely sexy.  the fabric is not heavy at all, it's silky so you can wear this all 4 seasons.  you could wear this under a jacket too if you'd like.  i bought this in black and am thinking about anohter in the blue, or the green.. very beautiful shirt!  thanks for reading.
252930	like the varsity shorts of back in da day when dudes where cool with wearing short shorts.  nice slim hot fit that gets the necks snappin like a ping pong match at the pool and beach.  great find and excellent price.
252979	purchased to take on a trip to mexico so i could easily go from the beach to a restaurant, etc... easy to throw on and go. love it.
252985	this product is a little bit of a more shiny material than it looks in the photos, but it definitely fits well and the fabric is nice and silky/soft so it is comfortable to wear.
252998	this ring is true to picture, does seem to about a size small. i love it!! i am having to switch to white gold from yellow gold and that being a very expensive switch, i thought i would try this way first, considering my job, rings take a licking on me. so far i am very happy with my purchase. i will be buying again (as long as this ring don't tarnish!). :)
253033	i like the quality and the style, however, it was a little durty! i had to take to the dry cleaners before use.
253042	i usually have a lot of trouble finding shirts that fit me right in the shoulders. even with slim-fit shirts, they tend to sag low on my arm. maybe the designers are trying to tell me i need to do more shoulder exercises, but calvin klein body fit seems to be the right size. the sleeves also aren't puffy like a lot of slim-fit shirts are, which i never understand. slim fit should be slim all around, in my opinion. the material is nice also. definitely a shirt i will need to iron every time i wear it, but the no-iron material never looks very formal to me.
253061	for the price this is a steal, its very well made and i like the shiny stone, it will make any hand look pretty.
253066	this ring looks real from afar, the silver is nice (and i like the thick band design).  so far i've worn it for a few weeks without any tarnishing.  i know that cubic zirconia stones can get cloudy with lots of exposure to water and such (hand washing, lotions), etc. but so far it has stayed looking shiny and new.  hopefully that shininess lasts, as i bought this as a temporary wedding ring (my real ones don't fit due to pregnancy).
253180	do not get this wet, lotion, oil, body spray nothing on it. because it changes color really fast. i was a bit disappointed in this because i've gotten accessories in the past that lasted way longer
253189	i love the bracelet for its design, however i only got to ware it one time the charms turned my wrist green! i contacted the seller and they very graciously replaced it with another bracelet which sadly did the same thing.
253233	these are very soft and fit well but the brown color got a hole at the back after the first wash i guess the stitching was too close.
253234	not for yoga, they are too short! comfy underwear. they look exactly like in the picture. arrived on time. no complaints so far!
253297	this dress is perfect if you have larger hips. if it wasn&#8217;t made for a curvy figure, there would be no way i would have been able to get it zipped up. i ordered the small (i&#8217;m 5&#8217;4&#8221;, 125 lbs) and i had it to lay on the bed to get it zipped. the chest area is very snug so i&#8217;m ordering it in a size medium to see if that will be a better fit. otherwise, it fit great everywhere else and the material is thick so it&#8217;s comfortable and flattering. my boyfriends jaw dropped so he definitely approves.i&#8217;ll update this review and give it 5 stars if the medium gives my girl&#8217;s more room.
253301	i like the quality of this dress very much and the fit is perfect. the color is a true creamy white.
253364	i should have realized from the cheap price tag that we would get what we paid for!  the shoes were needed for a weekend event and arrived just in time.  however, as soon as we took the shoes out of the box, we noticed that one of the straps was not attached.  to make matters worse, the seller (shoe dezigns) accused us of breaking the strap, even after i sent an email immediately after we received them to explain their condition on arrival.  the seller was horrible to deal with.  i will never order a product from them again.
253374	my shoes arrived very promptly.i am very pleased with them. they were exactly what i wanted and they fit great. great quality and good value!
253407	i love these big, heavy type rings. if you don't, then this isn't for you. if you do, you will love this ring. it's delivered very quickly and exactly as pictured. i bet you will get some nice compliments as i have. enjoy!
253450	these are the nicest sox.  colors stay bright washing after washing.  i will buy again.  my daughters will love them too.
253458	im 5'5 and i weigh 130 lbs, good length if u wanna feel sexy and the material mimic silk very well. soft and i love the streachy thong cause i have a huge butt. the robe itself is abit small when u try to rap it around but it stretches. i love my robe super cute. i boughg it in dark purple &#9829;
253481	bought this for my wife for christmas. its your standard silkscreen design. material was somewhat thin, like the vintage style tee at target. ran a little big we thought.
253510	this couples necklace set rocks! can't wait to give this as a gift to my brother & sister in law for christmas. the chains are great quality, the charms are a little smaller than i thought... but i wouldn't change this necklace at all. very happy with this purchase!
253561	this is a good quality product.  it is 100% cotton and very durable with lots of pocket room. they fit nice and are very comfortable.  it has an inner drawstring belt as well.  i like them so much i ordered two more in different colors.
253612	very pretty, soft and comfortable skirt. my 19yr old daughter says she is gonna a take it,  she likes it so much. i have gotten loads of compliments on this. i would definitely recommend.
253623	i bought these for my 83 year old mother-in-law.  they fit and were comfortable immediately.  she loves to walk 2-3 miles a day and she can wear these!  a great shoe for a really great price!
253628	going on holiday to cancun and need some comfortable beach wear. this is to long on me but can be hemmed. very pleased.
253693	items shipped fast. the bright colors are awesome. these leggings have great fit and quality. bought 2 more pair. hope to buy more in the future.
253712	my daughter loves to wear 2 shirts, a tank and a burnout or light weight shirt over them, the color and sizes were correct, and she wears them regularly.
253769	i bought these to wear while walking/jogging in italy on a 2 week cruise - fila being a brand name over there they did help me blend in a bit.  the uppers lasted well, and clean up nicely, but i had to get rid of them after the trip - we walked around 10000 steps a day during that 2 weeks and that was all these shoes could stand.  the shock absorption was gone as was the vast majority of the tread.  they had a nice even wear pattern, but i do demand more than 2 weeks wear out of a pair of shoes!
253795	"this outfit is awesome. it's an excellent combination of sexy and cute. i'm 5'6"" and weigh about 130 lbs and the medium fits me perfectly. the pom poms just hang down while there are actual ties at the top that can loosened or tightened depending on your cup size. it's  short, runs a little higher than mid-thigh. the only downfall i see is that the ears don't stay up. when the hood is up, the ears kinda lay flat against it. i'm gonna try some starch to get them to stay, hope it works! also, this costume is $39.99 at party city, and i got it on here for $29. great costume for a great price!"
253818	these are almost like wearing yoga pants all day! i love that they don't bind or pinch and i was comfortable even sitting at my desk. i will certainly be adding more to my wardrobe! yea!
253826	i like everything about this dress. the fabric and pattern are quite nice. it is a little short and a tad tight on me, but i am a larger size.  i am 5'5&#34; and it definitely hits me shorter than the pictured model.  not something i will ever wear alone, only as a swim suit coverup.
253890	i have very long legs and these reach right to my ankle however since i bought them with boots in mind it's no biggy.
253911	these stretch jeans are super cute, but not soft like the jeans that i have been spoiled into wearing. this is the best deal that money can buy for the actual quality, they're just not velvety soft to my liking. would i buy them again, absolutely. would i compare them to a pair of sold design lab (my favorite), absolutely not, but in all fairness, they aren't even at the same price point. lastly, these jeans are trendy and do definitely make a statement. i am happy with my purchase.
253913	everyone order a pair of these they are stylish affordable i get so many compliments and they can be worn at  any occasion heels,sandals,flip flops or what ever you desire these are great and good quality pants great material and arrived on time
253918	i was really dissapointed in this swimsuit.  the swimsuit is beautiful and made of good material.  but it was not for me.  i'm very short torsoed and have a small waist and ample chest.. but there is no support and the sewn-in cups were set too high.  it's more suited for a perkier chest?  not sure.  no amount of adjustment save a removal and re-sew of the cups would work.  i might try that and update my review.
253934	having traveled internationally for years, i found the longer travelsox to work great.  i found this crew sock and wanted to try it out for travel and especially for daily office work.  as i have gotten older, my feet are more tired each day, even sitting at a desk and not just standing up and on my feet.the crew length is perfect.  the cushion on the sole is awesome and so comfortable.  most importantly, my feet feel great at the end of the day.  plus, i tried them on a recent road trip where i had to drive 7-8 hours in each direction.  i arrived at my destination and then my home with feet in great condition, not tired and not achy.i definitely recommend these socks!!
253935	i intermittently suffer from plantar fasciitis in my right foot, and as an airline pilot clearly travel a lot. i was looking for a black crew sock that that had some compression for my plantar fasciitis and decided to try these. overall these are very good socks. being compression socks they obviously tend toward being snug and indeed they are (when in doubt order up a size.) i wear a size 12 shoe and the xl fits well. they are comfortable on long flights (though i'm glad to get them off at the end of the day,) but most important to me the &#34;plantar fasciitis support zone&#34; really does help keep my arch comfortable even during plantar fasciitis episodes. they are wicking and antibacterial, and in my experience stay dry all day under reasonable circumstances. i am pleased with my travelsox and plan to buy more.
253944	i love this scarf.  lots of compliments!  i wear this with a dress that has a low v neck.  it is definitely more modest with the scarf.
253998	i bought this watch as a gift to my husband! its casual and semi-formal at the same time!! it is really affordable and you can really see the quality of it. it comes in a very elegant box and ready to be given as a present! even if it is a present to yourself! i really recommend it! it made a big impression on my husband!
254010	this watch is gigantic - 52mm diameter. its so big it has two straps to hold down wrist band in the back.i like it because its analog, shows the day of the week and date very large, and has an alarm. i'm trying to get used to the big size.i don't recommend it for a small wrist.
254082	thiis tee shirt is  very pretty for anight out on that hot summer days under ablazer and geans  i have most of the color .i love t try it you will just love it
254104	so cute with the little sparkle accent is a huge hit with my daughter. i love the color variety and will probably buy more. the only thing i wasn't sure of is how wide they would be off the leg/thigh area as we typically have her wearing spandex type shorts under her dresses. you could not see the shorts but they do not sit as tight on the leg as spandex/biker type shorts do. the waist is nice and comfortable, not too tight.
254168	i love how cute it is, looks pretty much exactly like the picture. it is very soft and warm so a plus for the winter. my only issue is it has some loose threads that need trimming.
254198	the clasp was broken and cheaply made.the chain was beautiful but not worth the money as the clasp broke during the first wear.
254225	don't expect anything fancy but these sunglasses aren't bad at all for the price. you get a three pack for less than what you would pay by purchasing a similar pair of sunglasses at the store. i usually wear high end sunglasses with a much smaller lens so i wasn't sure if i would like aviator glasses. however i like the way that these look on me and i like the mirrored lens chrome frame and they are comfortable to wear. they seem like decent quality and maybe slightly better quality than expected for the price. the only thing i would change it to add a little darker tint to the lens. when i look toward bright sunlight i still get blinded sometimes. if they would make the lens a little darker that would be great.i was provided with a single pair of sunglasses courtesy of newport blvd in exchange for my honest review.
254286	i bought this for a friend who is a breast cancer surviver. the scarf color is reminiscent of the breast cancer pink ribbon, and the butterfly pendant symbolizes hope.  both scarf and pendant are lovely, and of good quality material.  service was excellent; shipment was speedy; packaging was well done. i have ordered again from liuanan and am impressed with the continued good  quality and service.  i highly recommend both this item and this vendor.
254342	first of all, i received my pack of genie bras in a plastic sack and not in a genie bra box like they sell them at the store. i wasn't sure if they were real so i bought a real set of genie bras from the store to compare it to. the nude wasn't the same exact shade even though i had bought one &#34;nude&#34; bra from the store and one from amazon. i would assume that genie would make all of their &#34;nude&#34; bras out of the same material. also, the bras that i bought from the store had a different color for the printing on the back (like a where the tag would go if there was one). the printing on the bra from amazon was just slightly uneven too. lastly, the material that the bras were made from that i bought from the retail store was thicker.after having read the other reviews, they said to go up one size. now, i usually wear a medium (size 8) in clothes but i wear a bra that is a 34d, which genie bra says would be a large. i did not think that trying an xl bra would be a good idea since i never wear xl in anything so i figured i would take genie bra's advice and do a large. well, it was way too big. was that because it wasn't a real genie bra? i mean, it was huge. i don't know why people say to go up a size. maybe the fake genie bra's aren't always consistent about their bra sizes? it was so big that i might as well have not been wearing a bra at all, my breasts had absolutely no support.so, the set of genie bras that i bought from the store are size medium. they are a ton smaller than the set from amazon. as far as the support goes when you have the right size (and i say go down a size if anything, not up), the support is exactly what you should expect from any decent sports bra. just like any other sports bra, the genie bra gives me a uniboob. it's not my favorite thing but it's otherwise comfortable and doesn't make me look like i have a fat back. if you can stand having uniboob, i would recommend getting a real genie bra in a well fitting size.
254356	i loved the idea of these liners to wear with low sneakers and shoes.  i tried them a few times but each time the elastic really cut into my feet, even when i tried wearing them even lower or higher.  i just couldn't find a comfortable fit.  i am a womens size 8 shoe.
254435	i am a cowboy boot girl.  pointy toe all the way!!! buying round toe boots make me nervous.  these have enough of a toe to be able to find the stirrup if you need to or to quickly find that toe hold to scamper up a fence to get out of a round pen.  also, stranger compliment me on them when i am walking around.
254442	these boots are really nice but they do run small.. had to buy another pair they are really cute . but remember they run small
254463	my fiance tried this shirt on at a department store and bought it. it looks and fits great. since i am a serial amazon shopper, i decided to see if amazon carried any kenneth cole shirts. to my great satisfaction, they do! he bought this shirt in two different colors, paid to have one-day prime shipping and it was still less than the price he paid for this (1) shirt in the department store. amazing deal!if you are a guy that does not typically wear slim-fit dress shirts, i would recommend trying it on in a store first or being prepared to utilize amazon's free returns on apparel. my fiance wears a slightly different size in the slim fit vs. the regular fit kenneth cole shirts.overall, i highly recommend this shirt. the material is great quality, the colors are awesome (he bought charcoal and purple), and they look so stylish. i am very impressed.
254474	rarely have i been disappointed with new balance running and/or trail shoes. there is not a break-in time, they are comfortable, great for the gym and for casual wear. i wear a medium (n.b. has width variations) and i buy 1/2 size larger than my 'true' shoe size for a good fit. and, if you're into style/look, new balance has some great colors and color combinations such as the 610. the shoe insert is removable, as with most n.b. shoes, so one can insert an orthotic. this particular shoe is also good as a dirt deterrent.
254550	the item was better than i expected, daughter loved it will order another just like it, the chain and heart are very pretty.
254562	i took it out of the package....and it fell apart :( i'd been better off putting a quarter into a gumball machine than spending for something overseas that is put together so poorly.
254617	i ordered it may 10th and got it and the end of july. bye bye summer. the suit was okay but not worth the wait. the suit is shipped from thiland. i did not know that. i would not use this site again
254622	"this pair of shoes is beautiful, fits well, and people really like it. i got some compliments. you notice by touching or wearing it that it is not suede or nubuck. the manufacture call it ""synthetic suede"", but it feels hard to the touch. the only similarity to suede is the way it looks. suede is soft an malleable. anyways, it looks great! although it is hard, it does not hurt, there is plenty of room for your toes. this pair is very good for the price.i am editing this review: i have that pair of boots now for 2 months. it feels that after wearing it for few months it gets less and less hard. they are quite comfortable. people really like them. it is really a good buy. my is 6.5 and my toes have plenty of room even wearing thick socks."
254675	now is my fault i followed the other comments and ordered an xl instead of l.i'm 5'6 and 160 pounds and xl fits like...under my breasts, waay to big.the material is very good, leather like, i love it.just order your normal size.
254678	this is perfect for my 5th grader. her books started to way too much and i was afraid she would hurt her back. this rolls well, has plenty of room and looks like it will last a few years.
254741	performed amazingly. i work a labor intensive construction job 10-12hours a day in the north east. it kept me perfectly wa and dry.
254758	arrived a few days early and they are super soft and so pretty. the packaging is just the plastic pack they are mailed in which i didn't like, after reading other reviews i figured i would risk it about the size and i am really glad i only gave a few dollars. if you have any muscle in your thigh and have some hips these will not fit. i was so disappointed they are made for a child or a someone who is a double 0 to 1. they had a few strings from the hem but if you take a lighter to it quick they wont run. the material is really super soft and there is no tag which i like. other then taking forever to ship and being cut so small they would be a good purchase for what i spent super bummed i cant wear them. :(
254786	even if you don't workout, i don't see how the sleeves on this thing will fit anyone.  i bought the xl, i work out about 3 days a week - and my arms could probably rip the sleeves if i flexed.  i was barely able to even get them over my arms in general.  this shirt is unbuyable unless you have insanely small biceps to match.  i bet i could go up 2 sizes and the arms would still not be big enough, the xl's arms were that small.  i had to return it.
254841	all i can say is, cheap and it does not  stay on your ear, will not buy ever again! you get what you pay for...
254853	first, shipping was 7 days. i ordered it on the 9th and received it on the 16th, so right off, shipping was as expected. second, the color is better in person. on my monitor it looks more purple, as in true purple. in person, it looks like a deep eggplant. i saw the description as &#34;eggplant&#34;, but i ordered it thinking if it was too purple i would just send it back. i won't be doing that though, it really is a deep eggplant and at night nobody will be able to tell it's even eggplant, it will look brown, which is perfect for what i want, but if you're wanting that true color wheel purple, this isn't it. there is a pocket on back that does not lock, but it's close to your body, so i will use it, but obviously i won't put anything too valuable in there. the back pocket will fit a paperback with a little room to spare, and it is perfect for a guidebook and some maps, so that's what i'll use it for. the top flap, which has the twist clasp, opens to the main zippered compartment, which is a locking zipper. i put my ipad in there just for size purposes, and it fits with about an inch left on each side (going side to side). front to back, with the ipad in there, it left about an inch on either side. so, i'll put my ipad and hand sanitizer there. there's not much room for a lot of other stuff, but it does have a zippered mesh pocket inside, which i will use for my passport and it also has a little light attached to the inside so you can see what's in there without having to pull everything you own out of the bag. the bottom flap has two zippers that attach to the clasp in the middle, as seen in the stock photo. i will let you know, this does take two hands to get both zippers undone and re-attached. this isn't a problem for me, because i won't be holding anything in either hand that would cause this to be a problem. but i can see where this might be cumbersome for someone with dexterity issues or if you know for a fact that you're going to need to get in that pocket very quickly. for me, this is what makes it anti-theft and it's what i wanted so it's not an issue. when that flap is open, it opens to a wallet type compartment. it has 5 slots for credit cards, a smaller pocket that can be used for a cell phone, and a mesh pocket that does not zip. you could fit a pocket camera there, but not if it has a lense that extends out from the body of the camera permanently. oh, and something that i didn't see in the description, is that the bottom compartment is rfid blocking. and it also has a cut proof strap that can be adjusted to be used as a crossbody but can also be shortened enough to put on your shoulder. you could also detach the strap and re-attach it after wrapping it around a chair or something, but i won't be doing that at all.  i just don't see how this bag can get any better. it is well constructed and doesn't feel cheap or flimsy, yet is lightweight. i'll be using it for a week in germany and a week in paris.
254865	good material. the color is the same as the one shown in the photo. buy it for college and i received compliments from all my friends. nevertheless thought it would be a little bigger (as it fit my laptop) and did not. however i still love
254882	ah. i love these. they are comfortable. i wear m in most stretchy-pants and ordered an xl from this and they fit perfectly. super comfortable.
255011	very cushy.  love how these shoes feel.  they are a welcome addition to my fall wardrobe.  can't wait to wear them.
255023	i love it.  this necklace is just what i have been looking for...a statement necklace.the color is great too and will go with a lot of my clothing.
255132	i loved loved the shirt the first time i wore it (before i washed it). after couple of washings was too short..
255157	i love this! i cant wait to wear it! i got it for an upcoming beach trip and i have always loved this style so i finally took the leap! and i love it! very flattering.
255175	my new favorite shoes!  style goes with lots of outfits.  well made and stylish shoe.  would order these in other colors as well.
255204	fit just as i expected...ordered my regular size and had no problems. i got it in purple...which i love and the hemline makes me feel like twirling around.i am also short (5'0&#34;) and it went to my ankles...which i again loved because it made it feel more like a maxi.loved this and would buy again!
255222	"this dress fit me perfect, i'm 5'4"" 150 lbsexcept in the picture it appears to almost be down to her ankels,  it barely made it to my knees!  so this dress is very short compared to the picture.  i ordered 2 difference dresses, same type style and they came right where the picture showed.  not this dress"
255251	this dress is a bit looser in the bodice than i'd like, but that may just be because i am fairly flat-chested. it has a lot of nice detail and i like the &#34;swingy&#34; skirt, but be aware it is a bit heavy to wear someplace like hot humid fl (unless you stay inside with air-conditioning). there were numerous threads that needed to be trimmed off but didn't ruin the integrity of the seams or embroidery, but one can't expect perfection for $30 and i've had more expensive items that suffered the same issue. overall i think it is a good buy for the price and i personally am always pleased to find grey clothing or shoes.
255265	ordered 9/24eta 10/22ata 10/10i bought these because i wanted to see how well $9 legging would compare to some of my name brand favorites... blackmilk.tag reads size &#34;5&#34; -  i would consider them med/lgmaterial is better than most knockoffs i have tried else where. does not go see thru when worn.the bottom halves are not great and a bit flimsy. the material clearly does not have a large amount of spandex.overall. thumbs up. will be buying again.
255377	this is a comfortable shirt but it is form fitting so i  recommend a size up from normal.  the neckline is a little too revealing i have to move my bra straps outward so they won't show.  but it is a comfy, attractive tee.
255403	i love my gold pants...i live in new orleans so gold is a very tolerated color...black and gold for the saints, purple,green and gold for mardi gras and green and gold for st. patrick's day :) of course the fact that they're lame sucks but they're a hit every time i wear them :)
255424	this belt is a dream.  latches securely and unlatches easily.  making a size adjustment is also very simple.  highly recommend this belt, especially if you're looking for something secure yet comfortable and adjustable.
255469	i am 5'10, athletic, and i wear these for yoga practice. they fit me like a glove, the legs are as long as the picture shows. all the women in the class love these. i feel great in them, they are nicely elastic and soft. i will see if they can go the distance, but the seams are done well, so hopefully, there will be no problem.
255495	this is probably meant for juniors but i'm small so i bought it.  it's very long on me and a bit bit..but it will probably shrink in the wash.  it's cute and soft enough.  might get a small next time.  i'm 5 ft. 105 lbs.
255514	"just as i expected, a lightweight, slightly see-through peasant top.  fits true to size, looks really cute with all sorts of trousers and skirts, and it did well in a cold water machine wash, hang dry.  i bought another color, guess that means ""i like it""!"
255561	too large  and material is very cheap .  i washed it and it looks like a an old wrinkled rag.
255574	i had purchased a couple of these in different colors.  the fit is good.  i am an xl.  i know they will shrink, so i bought 2x and it was a bit large, so got a 1x.  the colored blouses seem to be less sheer, so i ordered a white one.  i will only wear it out at night as if you step into the sunlight...sheer city!  the darker ones don't seem to do that.  also, i got one with buttons...the buttons do not stay closed.  they wrinkle terribly, but that is the nature of the fabric.  they are wonderful for really hot, humid days as they are light and airy.
255576	just as described, couldn't ask for a better fit for myself, i'm an old hippie so this shirt goes with all my  clothing.
255597	if you are larger than an 8 or 10, this dress may not fit very well.  also, if you are very busty, it may not fit well either.it's a cute dress, but the sizing description  is somewhat misleading.
255616	a beautifully styled shoe is a delicious color.  the fit was perfect.  so sad to return them but i did not care for the cow hide fabrication.
255647	i bought this dress for my mum looks and feels amazing i'm told it's also very sexy the right look it's also very soft against the skin
255663	i choose the 5 star because the ring came and is beautiful! i wear it everyday! it came and i was entranced with how attention to detail the ring is and the size. i understood it to be a men/women ring which made it worth the buy. i am glad i purchased it and was worth the wait!
255691	what a great value for the price!  the colors are rich and beautiful, the pattern is gorgeous; and the material flows perfectly even though i'm a busty 38dd and a size 14.  i put it on and couldn't believe how pretty it was.  buy it - you'll love it!!
255732	i thought that the chest and shoulder area was really small and the top was shorter overall than i expected from the photo.  i returned it.
255772	i like the dress, the feel of it and how it flows.  unfortunately, one sleeve was too wide and i had to fix it because i didn't want to go through the hassle of having to return it.  i wasn't happy with that because the fix affected the flow of the side that was fixed.
255777	this caftan is very comfortable.  i love the way it feels on my skin, soft and airy.  i will definitely buy more; already purchased some sleeveless blouses, of the same material/design, to wear with my jeans. thanks for a nice product!
255786	loved the colors and the material, but there was no way to wear this in public without a full slip underneath - which negates the whole point of having something cool to wear for summer.
255787	i really like this dress. as for the color it didn't bleed. i washed this alone 3 times in cold and on gentle cycle. added 1/4 cup of vinegar just in the first washing w/ my detergent. that helped the colors to stay. (and your clothes do not smell like vinegar) i line dry almost all my dresses. i hope this has helped.
255877	i got so many compliments on this dress - that i ordered all the colors - i love it and would recommend it to everyone
255957	looks exactly how it is shown online, colors are stunning i'm 5'11&#34; and i got the 3x so it woulg be long enough and the only thing i can say is now it drags the floor but i love it.  the material feels good on my skin and from a side view i actually look thinner,  now that's for sure worth it to me.  i love this dress....you guys better get a few for yourselves before i buy em' all  lol!!!
256032	i will start by saying i adore patty tops and i have quite a few. i have auburn hair and tend to stay away from purple because i always felt that it clashed. on a whim i decided to try this top in the purple and am so glad i did. the color is almost a light eggplant color that compliments rather than clashes with my hair. i love it and am so happy with this top. as with all patty tops the sleeves are nice and long which is perfect for us long limbed girls and the fit is absolutely perfect. be careful if you decide to purchase your fist patty top as they very quickly become addictive!
256162	nice dress.  not as pretty as in the picture.  i washed it before wearing, because it had chemical smell of dye.  tip: wash it in cold water only, add some vinegar as it fades momentarily.  still it faded a lot, but  the dress looks cute anyway.  the price is  just right and it is good to wear to the beach, some outdoor functions.
256196	"i buy from sakka regularly because they always fit; are of quality construction (no seams coming undone a month or so after purchase . . . no buttons falling off . . .); and the dresses are always better looking in person than online.  plus, all of them are machine washable, and hold their shape and color.  all are also ""color fast"" - i have never seen a sakka dress bleed into my laundry. honestly, i've spent a lot more money on dresses at dillards, saks, and other ""upscale"" stores, and have finally learned to shop sakka first."
256243	this fits a little snug, but it's awesome anyways!i got a lot  of compliments. perfect for work or play
256282	bought this for our 33rd anniversary and it is a wonderful dress.  classic styling and plenty of flounce for a feminie feel.  the color was perfect with my peridots too!
256322	dress fits great on my 5'4 frame.  dress it up by adding a different belt.  washes nice too. would order again from this manufacturer.
256331	it looks and fits just like the picture. very nice. i should have purchased a small instead of a medium (i'm 5'2&#34; and 132lbs) but hopefully it will shrink a bit. i did notice that after wearing the shirt, sime of the color faded onto the sleeves. hopefully this comes out. i will purchase the other colors in a size small.
256342	these were supposed to come a month after i ordered them, but they came in a week! they're very soft, stretchy and comfortable. i'm very happy i bought these
256368	"these boots are great - really really like them.  the color is very pretty and they fit true to size (i am a 7.5 and occasionally an 8 so i ordered 7.5 and they fit well.)  the wide calf is perfect for my calves (approx 15"") and should work well with either tights or skinny jeans / leggings.  satisfied customer!"
256511	first off, if you're looking for a sheer cloth to throw around you for stylish reasons, here it is. however, if you're paying the 10 dollars it's asking for, you either have money to burn, or you don't understand the value of raw materials and the cost of making things.
256585	although the shirt was a little small for me (maybe i ordered the wrong size, i am a size 16 and i am tall), the shirt was really cute. i liked the colors. the olive green color it a nice change to my everyday black/grey/silver/white/tan/brown theme i have in my closet. the shirt i would say is for more of a petite girl, it is short almost above the waist line of jeans and the arms are &#34;mc hammer&#34; cut, which is very popular right now. cute shirt! great price!
256592	this is my favourite blouse. without a doubt. fabric is cheap, but the price is pretty low after all. if only it came in black or other colours.
256596	thin stretchy fabric. i am a small person 5'3&#34; 103 lbs fit perfectly. a little see through. so cute, loved it!
256620	i've had this dress on my &#34;wish list&#34; for a few months, and i finally purchased it this week. the fabric is a decently heavy-weight stretch blend that is appropriate, i would think, for all seasons. the top of the dress (shoulders and bust) fit as expected. the dress is definitely loose around the middle, and since i am rather thick-waisted, that is not a problem i usually have. so keep that in mind when you select what size to order. i solved that problem with a wide belt, and the dress looks quite lovely. overall, i am pleased with my purchase.
256677	material is nice and style is pretty, but sizing is way off.  bought a 3x and could not even slip it on.  had to return it.  return was easy, though.
256701	this shirt is beautiful and i love the way it looks. it felt smooth at first but after first wash, the fabric has become scratchy. it makes me sad because when i first got it, it looked so nice, i thought, maybe i should buy this shirt in several colors, but i'm not going to do that now. if something were this style but with a better fabric i'd be all over it.
256702	i know 4x sounds big but i was a little disappointed, i'll keep it and wear it with a sweater but never alone. a little to tight.
256720	the dress fits really nice. sexy yet classy. material is very thin, shows any and every imperfection, but nothing some spanx can't fix. i plan on wearing for easter.
256754	when i opened the package it smelled a bit weird but it looked nice when i tried it on. i washed it and the smell went away and i'm pretty happy with it. however, i was hoping to get this dress for a more casual day wear but i feel like i need a special occasion to wear it.
256764	this is the find of the year for me. these dresses fit perfectly on my curves and the prints helps to conceal my slight core issues. these dresses can be wore year round i about to purchase another one now! thank you maker and seller!!!!!!!! make more prints please.
256772	i'm 5'2 and 110lbs i ordered a small, fits great but it's really long. i'm going to have my seamstress shorten it for me but if your taller by 3-4 inches you'll be fine.it's colorful, the pattern is fun looking, nice material and for the money a deal!!
256788	i enjoy the ring very much.  a little large for a toe ring even when adjusted  so i use it as a pinky ring.
256800	this shirt is meant to be worn somewhat loose. there is no stretch to the fabric. i normally wear a small and ordered a large, which fits great in the shoulders (not too wide) and looks good worn with skinny jeans. i have worn a tank underneath, since the fabric is thin, but you could get away with wearing just a nude colored bra without anything showing. the gold stud style buttons are very cute, the gold doesn't look cheap and the color doesn't chip off like some cheap embellishments' color coatings might. in fact, they feel like solid metal (obviously not real gold, but an attractive metal). if gifting this item; i recommend having it shipping to yourself first, checking for loose strings, clipping them, and then gifting. although sewn perfectly (no seams off centered or unraveling), there were a few uncut strings hanging from various seams, probably just the result of being manufactured at a quick pace. again, this doesn't effect the quality of the garment, as they are easy to cut off, but gift wise, the random strings cheapen the look of the garment until clipped. there were only a few, so chances are you may receive a shirt with no loose strings hanging. the colors are true to the colors in the image. overall, a very attractive, fashionable blouse. i received compliments while wearing.
256821	item looks like the picture, but is very short. i am a 5 foot tall woman so normally i never have to worry about this, but this dress barely covered my behind.
256826	this dress is cute but cheap.  i noticed a hole in the armpit after only one night of wearing it.  it's very comfortable though and a nice color.  i got lots of compliments when i wore it to a party.  overall, you get what you pay for.
256827	this dress is wonderful! i received many compliments while wearing it and i felt beautiful in it. the material is a little touchy in the washer so be watching out for that. other than that, everything went really well with the order and delivery.
256847	there is not as much fabric as it appears in the pic.  i won't ever wear it but did not send it back.  the belt is very cheap but the dress was so what do you expect?
256884	dress not as cute as in picture.  i ordered a size small and the dress fits like an extra large. instead of money being wasted, i will give the dress to my mother. also dress is way too long.  dress is way below the knee.
256937	i just received my new wallet and what a great piece of work and `security item'. my old velcro wallet was falling apart and too many times i pulled it from my pocket only to have all my credit cards and such fall out all over a public floor space. within a few days, i receive this wallet and it's nice.this wallet is made of genuine sheep napa leather. i tried sticking a piece of scotch tape to the `hand-made' leather/lambskin and it did not remove any of it. i like having two separate bill compartments - one for money and one for tickets or stubs/receipts. i had no idea i could actually use all of the (91) eleven card slots. unlike my velcro wallet, these are tight fitting pockets with no worries about them falling out. i can even shake the wallet upside down and it all stays in.there is a middle section that holds your driver's license (clear plastic), (and folds up) while the other side has three tight compartments. this does tend to make the wallet a little bit thicker than most, but inside my jeans or slacks it is secure without a huge bulge. for the price, this wallet is a real long-time keeper. product generously supplied by manufacturer for an honest review.
256962	this is the perfect, simple hipster wallet. it's crafted from sheep napa leather for a nice, soft feel with great, lasting durability. the hipster wallet folds out once and has room for several cards, identification, and slots for money and receipts. this wallet/billfold is the perfect size for men who don't need a huge wallet to stuff in their pocket. it's very simple, basic and super nice looking. the newport blvd black hipster bifold wallet is the perfect size to comfortably slip in your back pocket. the price is great for the quality. even the stitching all through the wallet is very well done. can't beat the price for a basic, well made leather wallet. dave and greg from newport blvd. are great guys to work with and they sent me this wallet to check out.
256963	i'm a card collector, meaning of course cards in my billfold, and this wallet provides a good deal of space for assorted credit and discount cards.  it has 8 compartments, 4 on each side of the fold, and each can easily hold two to three cards, depending on thickness.  this wallet also features two billfold compartments for both small and large bills.  or, in my case, extra places to store your cards.  on the whole, this is a high quality wallet at a very reasonable price.
256970	i feel like a degas ballerina in this skirt.  or a fairy princess.  the skirt is long so could easily be shortened by cutting the bottom.
256976	"i received this skirt today, and i absolutely love it! it's very pretty and feminine, and also a bit unusual looking. as far as the size goes, the measurements given by the seller were correct - i am 5'2"", and weigh about 130 and it fits me just fine.it's comfortable around the waistline, and the length is mid calf on me, which is exactly what i hoped it would be. i have an ivory satin victorian style blouse with black lace at the neck, and it will look great with that, but it will also look good with a plain top. i plan on ordering another skirt in a different color - if you're looking for a really pretty skirt, this is the one to buy, and it sells for a very reasonable price - highest recommendation for this seller!! update: i love the black skirt so much i just ordered another one in green - and as i expected, i love the green one too! hee grand has such unusual things and such great prices, i give them the highest recommendation! of course i will be buying from them again very soon - i think i will get one of their coats next. great seller!"
257015	i absolutley love the blazer and there's nothing wrong with the item. i thought the size i ordered was my size but it was too small. i gave the blazer to my daughter and it fits her perfectly!! we both love the blazer and thank you for the order. the construction is amazing!
257031	i ordered three different kurti from this seller, and i'll be reviewing each one, though each review will be basically the same.the neckline on this shirt is printed, not embroidered, and has some sort of stabilizer behind it. the bottom of the pattern does not look exactly as shown, but it's still pretty.these run large. i've got a 45 inch bust, so i ordered their 46 inch bust, as i was afraid there would be pulling if i sized down. the craftsmanship is about what you'd expect---some loose threads, but still lovely. the fabric is thin, but not so much that i would have to wear a tank top under it.these are also not as fitted as they appear in the photos. there is no tapering at the waist, and they are basically just kind of boxy. i imagine i could have it tailored, but i'm not sure the fabric would hold up through it.in short, this was worth it for the price, but the quality isn't what it appears to be in the photos.
257046	shipping: super fast and nicely packaged. these are great multi-functional skirts. you can dress them up for work or down for casual events. they are so comfortable i wear them around the house. changing into my yoga or sweat pants as soon as i get home is no longer the first thing i want to do. i love their versatility.size: i am 5'9&#34; tall and normally wear a 10-12. i purchased a medium and they fit nicely. it should be noted that while not skin tight they hugged my fanny ever so slightly. not in an &#34;i am showing off my curves&#34; sorta way.please note: these are simple skirts made with a nice double knit fabric. they aren't see through but they are reasonably thin. they are put together really well and you can't beat the price! i have 4 of them now and plan on getting some more soon.i forgot to mention so far the colors are as displayed. i have the blue m, army green, navy and heather grey-all great!!
257090	i'm 5'10. this skirt was too short for me. maxi skirts are supposed to touch your feet, and this went up to my calves. it looked ridiculous. i went with another brand instead.
257218	the fabric is very thin and for it being a size l it's too small.  this would go more for a size m, or junior size even.
257221	i bought this skirt based on the reviews. i was very disappointed. the color was great. i ordered the army green. but the material was very thin. you could see every dimple in your body. i own several of these skirts and none are this thin. plus it's not a real maxi. i'm 5'5 and found myself trying to adjust it to make it a maxi. i will give it away or it will be a house skirt.
257239	i'm 5'10, 120, and never find skirts long enough. i actually kept this skirt in the medium because i fear things being too short and i wear massive heels, but this one is just long enough. still - a word to the wise, while i kept this one in the medium, i ordered two more in the small (navy and brown) and the small is the way to go if you are skinny, as the length stays the same small, medium, or large. if you are shorter, simply fold the waist down.this green colour is terrific - the perfect green to pair with blacks or browns.also, make sure to watch how this skirt moves when you walk - the flow is stunning - i have gotten several compliments from strangers. it's the hidden awesomeness of this skirt that you don't get to appreciate if you're wearing it - only if you're watching it!
257332	the sizing is right on. they look great and feel soft, comfortable. wash well. would buy more in different colors.
257335	great for the price, the material isn't the best and is kind of cheap. fit very well, but was a good 5 inches or so too long so plan to get it hemmed if you aren't above average height
257339	at first they seem great- great fit, light weight, perfect length. however not long after you start wearing them on a weekly basis they are too thin, slightly see through, and they loose their elasticity quickly. so now it am constantly pulling them up. i only wear them to sleep in now.
257415	the style of the shoe is great and definitely a sexy look.  but the shoes apparently arecheaply made as mine arrived in very good time but they had scratches on the heels andthe strap across the toes are at an odd angle making them uncomfortable.  i have apair of black patent from nordstroms and they are very comfortable. gel pads on theball of the foot do help.
257422	i love these shoes. i almost bought the same pair at cathy jean a few days before for almost $100. i really wanted them but i knew i would not be able to justify to my fiance purchasing another pair of black shoes as he would say lol for that price. they fit perfectely and i cannot wait to wear them out.
257426	this is flimsy and cheap, nothing like the picture.  i'm not bothering to send it back, donating it to a girls home.
257433	this purse looks really nice and carries all my items. i love the summer cottage feel it has. great price too
257490	this shoe did have what seemed like an odd fit to it. my regular size, a nine, was too long for my foot. i had quite a gap in the back when the shoe was on. but the front almost felt as though going a size down would have made things too narrow to be comfortable. so, i shoved two tissues in the toe of each shoe and called it good! it shows a little toe cleavage now with the tissues there, but that doesn't bother me any, and the tissues will be easy to replace, should need be.i'm keeping them because the price is right and the heel is great for work. i can't wait for the weather to clear so i can wear them.
257509	i am 5&#34;2 and around 140lbs i ordered a large and it fit good. now mind you if you want something that is not going to show a little skin this product is not for you. especially if you have a little more junk in the truck. also if you are big chested i would not order this product. i am a small &#34;c&#34; and this item fit perfect but if i was just a little bigger i do not feel this item would work. this item was well made and was comfortable to wear. in all good purchase
257524	i bought the red jacket, thinking it looked closer to a pink, but it is red red.  even so, it's a great jacket. fits perfectly. i'm still very happy with my purchase.
257624	i really like this bag. it looks very nice. i especially loved the should strap that was inside of the pretty bag.  what i love most was the fact that this bag was shipped far ahead of time, which is unusual! this vender was on the ball!!!i would recommend this vender for fast, fast service!!!
257652	after reading so many negative reviews on this company..i have to say i am impressed that i received my item early!!i do love the way it looks big and comfy!!the material is a little different than i expected, but i did place another order with this company today, after being satisfied with all 3 purchases i made from them!!the quality of the items is great for the price and free shipping..worth the wait!
257658	these items are made fast and cheap.  i fell for it.  the ship from hong kong and you pay mucho to return.  clothes have a highly toxic smell. a no no.
257709	this is a super cute sweater. not as long as pictured, but i am 5'8&#34;, so i don't normally expect things to look on me the same as on models. it is thin, so will need something underneath, as pictured. but, it will look great with a dark/bright tank underneath and dark cargos or jeans. for the price, you can't beat a great little layering sweater like this.
257765	this sweater is light and airy, soft and cuddly, not very structured but great for a casual slouchy look. i bought two, one in black and one in yellow. the fit was true to a large size and was the same in both sweaters.  the length is long enough to wear as a tunic over leggings, which is how i plan to wear them. there was a slight odor from manufacturing or packaging, but i washed the sweaters before wearing and they were fine. the light knit weave air dried quickly.  the yellow color is more a sunny yellow than a mustard, it is a bit on on the bright side. for the price it is just what i was expecting, no disappointment on this end.. don't expect a super high quality piece, but for the price it is a good wardrobe addition for casual wear with fun mix and match potential. allegra k clothes are so inexpensive fun and trendy, but not something to keep and wear forever. for those who like to change up their wardrobe often so don't want to spend a bunch of money or are buying for a younger lady who changes style frequently this brand is great. i have bought several of the trendier allegra k tops for my teenage daughter and a few of the basic oversized pieces for myself and have been satisfied with all so far.
257775	ordered it big because i wanted a long and slouchy look, love it!  the only reason i gave this 4 stars is because i ordered the yellow and i thought it would be a mustard color, but it's more like a bright banana yellow but it's okay... ordering the black one next. also, the sleeves are a little short just fyi.
257829	it is a nice shawl,, but should be hand washed. the fabric is very fragile and gets holes easily if handled roughly or machine washed. also, if you wear 2x normally, buy 3x as this product runs small
257847	a little hard on the back of the heal the first wear, but after that very comfy, adorable, and great quality.  true to size.  don't expect padding as they are a true flat.
257934	when i bought online i did not realize it was a full one piece (the shorts, under garment and the top are all sewn together) which is inconvenient to go to the bathroom but still very cute.
258020	out of the park! the material is soft and light, very forgiving. the color is beautiful. the fit is very flattering and sexy-cute-casual. it was a little odd putting my arms through both the sleeve and the shoulder strap...i am uncoordinated...but once it was on, it was super cute. the little flap sleeve kind of masks the bingo-biceps i have developed by falling out of my workout habits. ugh.i am 5'10 and large busted...hourglass build that puts me in a size 6-8 pants depending on lunch. i hover between a large and xl in patty tops. i bought this in a large and that was definitely a good choice. it has a shelf liner in it if you want to go braless. i probably wouldn't, but it is in there and although not terribly supportive, at least it doesn't cut my boobs in half and offers complete coverage. (if you're well endowed, you know what i mean)great top. i've become a huge patty fan!
258027	man this is a great belt. the thickness helps to make my waist appear so small....i have been receiving soooooooooooooooooooooooo many compliments.
258037	i bought this because i was specifically looking for some nylon tanks to wear to bikram yoga. polyester traps in the heat whereas nylon breathes more. i've got tons of polyester tops with &#34;wicking&#34; capabilities but i start to roast in the middle of yoga class when i wear them. unfortunately, polyester is everywhere is nylon is much harder to come across these days. the tag on this tank clearly indicates it is 90% polyester, 10% spandex. another tank to add to my &#34;do not wear to yoga&#34; pile....aside from the misinformation about what this tank is made out of, i'm not that impressed. i am a 36 aa and typically wear a small or medium in exercise tops. this is advertised as a compression top so i expected it to be tight but it is very tight and not really that stretchy. i'm not convinced it would stretch to accommodate a much larger person without riding up with every movement. the description also states it can be worn long or short but it barely hits the top of my hips when pulled all the way down so unless you have an incredibly short torso, don't expect to be able to wear this over your butt as the picture shows.would not buy this again.
258061	i like these pants, but will probably not wear them out anywhere. they're really thin. other than that, i was surprised at how good these look on me and i wear them around the house often.
258068	these are cozy, nice and long for my hieght, and cute enough to wear around town even. if i had to pick a complaint, it would only be that the waist is a little loose on me. but they tighten up when you wash them, and for that price, its hard to complain. i would definitely reccomend these
258085	this is a cute top it fit great. the size chart was right on. the tie dye affect is a nice added tough. this top looks great with pants, shorts and skirts. i have a white mini skirt i ware with this top and it looks really cute together.
258097	have only had it for two day so have not had a chance to wear it yet the material seem very light so it should be very coolon our hot nebraska days.
258145	sooo comfortable, i got two just to wear around the house and to work in the yard.  they are so comfortable.  i'll probably end up buying a couple of more.
258163	perfect !!  i am new to the &#34;yoga pant&#34; thing.  but i didn't want the traditional black yoga pant.  i am not a soccer mom.  i don't wear sweats in public and my running pants were looking a bit ragged.  asked step dot about them.  she told me that i will want to live in them.  so true !!  these are just way too cute !!  i am 5'8&#34; but have a tall inseam.  i am very pleased with the length.  when i initially unfolded them, i laughed.  i thought &#34;these will never fit&#34; ~ wrong.  they fit perfectly !!  very pleased.  and of course, shipping was terrific !!  yes, i turned around and bought another pair !!  if i like something, it tends to be discontinued.  so, i am a very happy cutomer !!
258194	cute, extremely well made for the price. somewhat pinched in the toe box but not enough that i'll send them back. sturdy enough for a clumsy person like me to wear heels in though which is a major plus!
258255	i originally got these shoes in the 7.5 wide which is what i usually wear in ryka. i got the chestnut/pinecone/teal night color first try - *very pretty* color btw.i usually need the wide for my bunions/inserts ext. but these shoes have very stretchy mesh and the wide were actually too big, closer in fit to the next size up in my opinion.i usually wear a 7.5 wide in ryka but reordered to get these shoes in the size 7.5 b/m which fit perfect - the regular width feels almost exactly like my ryka women's dash walking shoe,white/grey/dark pink,7.5 w us  in cd/wide - so to account for the stretchy mesh i think if you don't need super wide shoes the regular fit should be fine. the black/grey/blue are also very pretty but i wonder how the color will stand up to trail dust. oh well they fit like a charm and are a different look from all my other brown outdoor shoes.i got the dark blue in the regular width and i wonder if they will get too dusty - however they fit perfect in the regular size.
258258	buying shoes online is always sketchy. i am really happy with these shoes. they are great for the weekend warrior hiking i do- light, breathable, and they don't give me blisters. they run true to size, too.
258267	i got so many compliments when i wore these, and they are very comfortable. i also really like the high waist, since i never have to worry about them falling down. the only problem is after wearing them one night of heavy dancing, the 'shiny' material is peeling away! i would have loved to wear them again, but they've been wore through after one wear
258289	it's see through! please make these in a thicker fabric. i got the pink and you can see your bra and underwear through it. i wear beige or white undergarments with light clothing..still showed through.
258301	this cute little ring is the perfect little accessory for a very small price. it goes well with other rose colored jewelry.
258408	love carter's items! they did take longer than expected but then again it was during christmas & no complaints at all as they did arrived 2 days befor christmas. they are true to size. soft on his skin. loved the colors & how they fit. can't go wrong with carter's if you ask me!
258454	definitely cute but absolutely no support.  haven't worn them for a long period yet so not sure how comfortable they will be in the long run but they look adorable and fit just about true to size.  maybe just a hair small but within specs.
258463	material is thin and its actually intended to use in the fall not really for the winter. if you want it for the winter buy yourself a nice cashmere instead of this. when i received this it smelled like paint thinner or something alike. it took a couple loads in the washing machine to remove the smell. over all i like the design and the different ways you can wear this.
258541	love the style of allegra clothes but most of them are simply too small regardless of the measurements provided. i have bought several of these and all but one did not fit. yes, as they point out, oriental women are smaller than us women but when they give the actually measurements that should be sufficient information to make sure we are getting out size. i wear a twelve normally. i have purchased these that say xxl or even xxxl and sometimes they say equivalent to size 16. not so  i am keeping this to cut out the pattern and sew it onto a larger top.
258563	it will work for a lightweight cardigan. it is a bit small to be a &#34;large&#34;. i normally wear a large in all other tops, so i expected this to be comfortable. it's only slightly uncomfortable and maybe with time and wear, it will stretch a bit.
258570	very bright, well made, nice material but it is too small and looks awkward, was a gift that just did not work : (
258571	i am a size 36b in the bust so i went a little bigger when buying this because so many of the indian kurtas are cut smaller than our sizes in the us. however, this one is true to size. usually in the us i would wear a size medium, but with the large, this was a little too big.
258601	this ring i love so much it, i have 2 other rings and this 1 is as good as my 60 dollar 1
258616	from any angle you catch color in this stone, even in low light conditions,the setting  is unlike anything i have ever seen.before, sleek, sophistication, timeless...
258619	these ones are actually pretty cute! and they don't make me look super weird when i put them on! they fit great and are lightweight so i don't think they'll drag my feet down when i am shelling in the ocean
258620	the rating i gave this item was because the shoe fit  length wise but it was to wide. it was not a snug fit as a water shoe should have been on my feet. they were nice looking but that the fit was off. i would not recommend.
258626	the shoes arrived quickly from this seller.  they are extremely comfortable and easy to put on.  with the draw string feature, they are secure enough to wear for physical activities.  i did notice that the white applique on one shoe did not match the placement of the other.  it is quite noticeable.  because of the price and my use for exercise, i will not return them.  also, i found this same shoe from another vendor that was cheaper in price and shipping, so hopefully the next pair will be matched.
258637	this is a good price foe an all leather belt.  have had it for a few months and wear it almost daily. it still shows no wear.
258639	very nice all around.  hard to find a good belt with the black/gold combination.  very impressed with this wardrobe option.
258648	i have not wore these yet.  they arrived in good condition and on time. they run a little small for the size.  but i plan to wear them on friday, when i go get me a pedicure.  that way i don't have to have my feet sitting under a fan for about an hour.  it's about getting my toes done and getting out of the nail shop!
258688	i really don't like this dress. it is not flattering at all. it is also really short. exactly the wrong length. i won't go to the trouble of returning it, but i won't be wearing it. it is also too big, i wear a 4/6 and am 5 feet 4 inches.
258690	the colors are bright and the springs on the straps can be adjusted to your liking.  it comes to my ankles and i am 5'4&#34; so will go nicely with heels.  i find you can also unwind the springs if you would care for less cleavage during the day and rewind to wear in the evening.  very soft material and very comfortable.
258773	just got this and i really like it! fits beautifully. i got the x-small-  i am 5'2&#34;, weight 115 lbs, and the size is right.  well structured coat.
258824	i was expecting little bit more quality for the price i paid ,but the material is thin and i don't think it would hold up if i use everyday ,i think for occasional use its good style .and it isn't as big as pictured .
258825	"i love the design of the bag and get so many compliments but it's really sad how cheaply made it is. the first day using it the main zipper tassel broke off and later that day the ""metal"" hook on the long strap snapped in half. so, now i don't zip it and i tied a knot on the strap so i can still use it."
258841	i needed a costume for a crossfit holiday workout where we have to come in costume.  i wanted something that would be fun, but functional and could be worn again in the future.  these spandex shorts,wonder woman t-shirt with cape and headband, andwonder woman superhero socksall work great together and are pieces that i can use for a future superhero run.i got the 6 inch length, and they're definitely long enough to feel modest.  the material is slightly on the thin side (compared t under armour compression shorts), but as long as you wear nude or white undies underneath, the white stars aren't see-through.  the color is bright, and the seams look well stitched.  i'll continue to use these as a pair of shorts for workouts.
258887	i got the camel color - very rich looking! it's about 1&#34; bigger in both directions than his other wallet, but he said it is well worth it for all the slots it has for charge cards. still fits in his prance pockets comfortably. with all the slots filled and money in the wallet in lays pretty flat. plus it's rfid approved. my husband is real pleased with this wallet and will order it again when it wears out.
258889	my husband travels often and i thought this would make a great gift.  he loved the appearance but when he placed his credit cards and id cards in the wallet it would not fold shut.
258912	i have never had to give anything less than a five star review for anything i have bought on amazon, but here goes. i love the material of this corset, i love the style of the corset, and i love the construction. however, and as much as it pains me to say this, it is small!!!! very small!! i normally have no problems with ordering small for any clothing anywhere and a lot of times i have seen reviews posted about things being to small from ladies claiming to have my measurements for the same clothes i buy and i'd often roll my eyes. this corset is not for a lady with hips. i thought i'd have a problem with my breasts in this, but nope. for someone with a 32 dd bust, the corset fit just fine on my breasts. (made the ladies look quite lovely) i had to let out the ribbon in the back quite a bit at the bottom for my hips, another problem: getting the damn thing on. i've had corsets with zippers and laces, but never with latches, and boy were these latches a pain in my rear end.i think if they were bigger latches and weren't placed on the boning piece, that this would have been perfect.other than that, i like the product, but i guess i just learned i have really big bony hips...
258969	they are just beautiful. look just like the picture, actually they sparkle more in person. center diamond(cz) is the perfect size. no one will question if they're real. i have ordered from lanyjewelry before and they always ship on time or you'll get them earlier then expected. if you like the princess cut engagement ring, this is the one for you. i highly recommend these for the couple on a budget. you will not be disappointed.update:going on three months with these rings. i lowered my stars from 5 to 3. i use to wear them often but the center diamond has gotten very cloudy. if it was easier to return, i would. i love everything else about this set. it's too bad they didn't use a better cz.
258991	what a beautiful skirt and you feel so good while wearing it.  i love the swirl and when you walk how it moves.  i was afraid of the gathering of material at the waist but it is extremely minimal and flat.  i wear it to work and wear it all day and it feels great.
258993	the belt doesn't fix. the skirt isnt as full as it look on  website
259013	this is an... omg dress if you want to feel like a princess this dress is perfect!i am not a thin person and this one size fits all  fits!! also i am short and still this dress fitsno matter the size it will fit! i just wish i could find more!it has an under slip with the dress but still the dress is see thru so if your shy... use a slip white works wellbut i found a pink 1/2 slip that just makes the flowers pop!!it says $0.99 but with shipping and handling... its $21.95 ... well worth the money!!!
259066	"i like these boots very much.  the quality of suede is better than expected; i always spray water repellant on my boots and shoes.  i wear these like some people wear a pair of sneakers. they're comfortable, the heel is not too high and they're well constructed. i'd recommend these to anyone as a casual go-to boot.  as long as you take care of them, they look good with jeans or skirts.  the color ""mink"" was not clear to me, but they are a darker beige, more tan or taupe-ish - very neutral.these are true to size, but i would order a half size larger if you plan to wear them with socks. they break in well , were slightly snug  at first, but  gave enough with wear while retaining shape."
259093	i have bough a few active basic tank tops before and i really like them, but i got the regular cotton and spandex ones before and they fit great and are extra long which i love. so i got the same size in this tank a small/medium but it 's actually a lot shorter than expected, i will keep it though because it's still a good tank top for working out or underneath a shirt. i decided to buy one more in the medium/large size hoping it will be longer.
259220	i really like this ring. it is good quality silver i wear it on my left hand right hand it doesn't look like a wedding band to me to be honest. i like the fact that the cubic zirconia's really sparkle like real diamonds. its a pretty ring i recommend to any girl looking for silver jewelry. i buy lots of silver jewelry and i can tell that this ring is really going to last me a long time.the only recommendation i have that in order for silver to keep its shine you need to clean it with a silver cleaning cloth (they sell many on amazon from 3 to 10 dollars any will do and they keep for a long time).
259240	these somehow ended up being labeled a size 7, but were really a size 9-9.5.) if they were wide, they would've fit my mom's larger feet.) i was extremely disappointed. the color wasn't that appealing either.ps. yes, i did compare my usual shoe site sizing to this sizing guide and the size 7's matched. this is my first bad experience shopping on amazon.
259245	what a pain in the ass.  good thing they are cute or else i'd be mad at them.  and i kinda am mad at them.the string in the front looked funny... dug into my calves weirdly... so i went and got some thicker lace.  took a while to get them strung where they looked right.  then! i tried walking in them.  the soles of these are felt.  i took one step on my hardwood floor and just.... fwinnnnng!!! i went sliding.  i plan on trying to find tread to stick on the bottom and ripping the rest of the felt off.but hey, they are cute.
259327	i ordered this shirt based on the sizes given and its not accurate at all. i wear a size us-12 and brought a size up.  the shirt fits great but it's a bit loose at the hem bottom which it looks fine.  it's a simple fun shirt that doesn't feel awkward to wear.  pair the shirt with a pair of cute leggings, slim or regular jeans and you will not be disappointed!
259340	love these cardigans.  lightweight they are great in warmer weather and long enough to cover the tush with leggings. they wash well, and i love that they have pockets.  i have it in several colors.
259373	it isn't really jersey but more like nylon or rayon/polyester blend. not at good of quality as i would like or expected.
259402	beautiful boot and if you have heavier calves, probable would be perfect.  these were way too big at the top so i returned them.
259404	i bought these for my mom. she was looking for high leather boots with 2 inch heel. not easy to find. these boot were exactly what she was looking for. they fit to the size. they are high quality, there is enough room around the calves for pants. simply great and elegant.
259488	first, i love mental masters. everything i've bought from them has been high quality at a great price. (the exception is that their their tiny czs don't really sparkle - but there are no small czs in this ring.)second, this ring is huge. i wear it on my right-hand ring finger - it would look ridiculously big on my middle or fore-finger. it took me a while to get used to the size. when i asked my boyfriend if it was too big, he said &#34;no.&#34;i think the size is balanced by the simplicity of the ring and the emerald cuts. when you look at it straight on, it shines beautifully when the light hits it just right. when you move your hand around, it shines and sparkles,while this is obviously too big to pass as real diamonds, i don't care. i wear it for the beauty and fun of it. i have no problem mixing what little real jewelry i have with costume jewelry. i recommend it if you love big stones and want something attention-getting and really different.
259496	love the shape and color of this  shoe, but it does run small.  i had originally bought and 8.5 but had to get the 9.  have not worn yet, and not sure if will be super uncomfortable or not (i suspect, due to the fact the quality looks ok, not bad but not great).
259511	i love the fit but the shirt is see through and requires another cami under it in order to be appropriate for public.
259575	i bought these for my son.  he loves them and would wear them everyday, given the opportunity.  i like that they have a little bit of fleece on the inside for warmth
259597	i ordered this bra in 32f, which is generally the right size for me. my breasts are full on top, which means they start high and they have a lot of tissue on the top part but less so on the bottom. because of the embroidery on top, this bra kind of made my breasts look like ski slopes, which i think is very unattractive. i had to return it because of the look.pros:thin straps that seem sturdycute printfirm, non-stretchy bandvery pretty embroidery - much more attractive than many of other cleo brascons:gore is too wide - it cuts into my breast tissuegore is very highshape is a little more natural than i like- it was kind of pointy
259625	i have always liked skechers brand for walking shoes, and so when i saw these with memory foam, and they were so darned cute, i snatched them up.problems... i'm overweight and i walk and am on my feet all the time.the memory foam smooshes flat, and therefore after about 1/2 hour or so, i have no support at all and my heels/calves start hurting. a full day in these and i feel crippled. they are not good for walking if you need support. my chiropractor said this is not a good thing at all.the upside. they look great and i pulled the memory foam out and replaced it with dr. scholl's gel inserts. so i still have the style, but now i have the support i need to.they fit me true to size, and there were no bad spots for rubbing or anything like that.
259626	i always size up in skechers.  i wear a 7to 7.5.  got an 8 in this shoe to accommodate socks.  the fit is perfect with socks.  the shoe is light weight and of good quality.  the memory foam is comfortable for walking.  have not gone for long walks yet, so i don't know how they will be then, but think they should work out very nicely.  purchased the black which is a true black.  the colors on the sole are so cute.  the picture doesn't do justice to this shoe.  overall very pleased with this purchase!
259632	these clip on are 4 my sister 2 wear because she wear can wear these kind of earrings on her ears she loves them very much
259636	extremely pleased that i bought this, gets a lot of compliments! very impressed with not only the quality, but also the rapid shipping & neat packaging.
259641	i have purchased many more for christmas gifts.  these are soft and long enough to wrap around anyway you want.  color is vibrant.nice scarf.
259797	my daughter is modest and does not care for low cut tops or see through shirts. so unusual for a woman these days and yes i am proud.  these undershirts suit her purpose. though i fear if they were dried in a dryer they would not get such high marks. unsure on that.  to the point, these shirts are for coverage, and that they do.
259819	all in all, i do like these. they're shorter than i expected they'd be; they don't quite reach my knee (5'10&#34;). they're of a thinner an lighter material than all my other mtb shorts, which can be seen as a good thing. the chamois pad which is attached to a netted lining like you'd see in a bathing suit, which is interesting. drawstring has a quick release like you'd see on a pair of boots. i don't have much confidence in this as a fastener, but that doesn't stop you from tying a quick knot anyway.overall, it's a good deal for the money. mtb shorts get surprisingly expensive, just don't expect these to wow you like a $80 pair.
259836	nice scarf, super long which i love! the only downside for me was that it isn't as nice as the picture. the colors aren't as vibrant, doesn't pop as much in real life
259880	i received this bracelet today. it is for a college student who is turning 20 and is more gothic than anything. i know she'll love it. i do.
259989	i liked the way it looked online, but i was shocked at the amount of compliments i received when i wore it to work. the fabric is very thin, but i didn't notice that it was see-through at any part, which i liked. it runs a bit large, though, which may be attributed to the fabric. it was sliding off of my butt before i realized it, but luckily i had a long shirt on that saved me! i got an xl in this and a different poly/spandex blend both from azules, and the poly spandex fit perfectly, but this one was big, so size down for this fabric.it does say hand wash, so i did for the first washing, but honestly i can't keep that up, so the second wash it went in the machine, and came out fine. i still hung it to dry, though i may try shrinking it now that i know it's large on me. maybe.
260028	when i first bought this dress, i was a little worried it would hug my curves in the wrong way. i'm 5'3&#34; and weigh about 140 lbs so i'm very curvy without being overweight luckily. but the dress emphasized my curves in all the right places. also, the dress was not see through and was very comfortable. i wore a body shaper underneath to be sure you couldn't see anything as well. so with the black bodyshaper, a black strapless bra and a little bit of dress tape to hold the dress in place (bodyshaper and dress tape optional for wear), it was an amazing look for my formal event. i would definitely recommend buying this dress. however, if you get the dress in red or grey, i would recommend wearing a slip under the dress.
260032	my gf is  5'3 so this maxi could be short of you're tall!  she looks great in it and is happy!
260038	i love this suit so much. the color is so pretty. i wear a 10 so ordered the xl and i'm glad i did. it fits very nice. if they had this in another color i would get another one. shipped on time. very happy.
260043	read other reviews and did as they said and went up 2 sizes.  this looks really good on. i would recommend this to others and i would suggest just like others that you go up about 2 sizes.
260046	i ordered this shrug in a 1x.  i weigh about 160 and thought it might be a little bit big.  it was entirely too small and i ended up giving it to a co-worker who is tiny.  my friends 5 year old daughter tried it on and it fit her nicely.  ridiculous!
260053	when this dress came in i was very skeptical that i had wasted my money. it wasn't fitting me properly in any way i am about 5' and 145 lbs this dress was too long even with me wearing 3&#34;heels.  also it looked as if i had purchased a red tent and plopped it on my body.  so i removed the frill from the neck so you could see that i actually had one and had the length shortened i also purchased a  gold belt to help define where my waist was. after these few simple adjustments the dress fit me very well and when i wore it to an event i got many compliments on the dress.  i love the inside of the dress its very soft and the dress was super comfortable.
260072	this watch is ginormous, light weight, and super comfortable. and then how in the world could it possibly be this inexpensive? this is just a darn fun practical watch.from a style standpoint, you can't miss this watch. the red is that anodized aluminum color, the kind found on safety equipment, carabineers, and airline handles. it is industrial cool. the face is huge, the numbers super easy to read, they are so large. the black rubber band is wide. the buckle has slots instead of holes making it much easier to adjust and put on. and the thing weighs nothing. the case is acrylic and the back stainless steel. the dial around the watch face does not rotate. the crystal is recessed below the level of the ring, protecting the crystal from scrathes.there is good and bad in the buttons around the watch. the good, they are big and easy to press; and the bad, they are big and easy to press. so many sport watches have these miniscule impossible to press metal buttons that drive me crazy. if i want to light up the watch or adjust the time, i have to dig hard and hurt my fingers pressing those buttons. these buttons are big and rubber coated and super easy to press. well, that's kind of the downside to those buttons. i find that when i'm working with the watch on, the buttons get pressed accidently. there isn't really a harm or foul, because you can't reset the time or anything else accidently. i just hear a little beep and the display changes temporarily to another mode.the light is different, i happen to like this version a lot. instead of the light creating a glow over the entire watch face, the light is from underneath and makes the number glow. i really like that a lot - it makes for super easy viewing in the dark.like most digital watches this comes with a ton of features, stop watch, timer, and alarm. they added some small niceties, pressing the reset button in time zone one, switches the display to military time. that's hugely helpful in europe. there is also a second time zone. i love this function when i travel. whenever i get on a plane, i always set my watch to the time zone where i'm going. that helps me a lot with jet lag, or even with one hour difference, just getting used to the new time zone. with a single time zone watch, i constantly have to think about time difference when i call home. with two time zones, one press of the button and i know what time it is at home. this is a nice feature.overall, this is one heck of a watch for a great price. if you like a larger watch and the red, black, and gray color, this is a fantastic bargain. the watch is also water resistant to 330 feet.i was provided a review sample.
260083	im always looking for a bold mans sport watch and i saw this one from armitron. it is now my favorite watch. it has a big dial and bezel frame which i really like and finally they went to a light lcd with a blue backlight so it is easy to see at night. it is also lightweight and easy to wear. if your looking for a &#34;man's&#34; watch this is a good one to consider.
260166	too small eventhough i did order it a size up. it's almost like they don't use enough fabric. seriously! its laughable!the supplier suggested for me to just give if to a friend and i would get half the price refunded to me.
260314	i have been wearing this ring for about 2 months straight -- in the shower, to bed, etc. i love it! it's gorgeous and doesn't turn my finger green at all. i can't believe how inexpensive it was.
260334	the corset is ok.... nothing fancy, but what can you expected really for $12? it is made pretty well i would say. i was unable to wear it with the costume i ordered it for, but i will keep it in my closet for another day i suppose. i ordered this 2 weeks before the date that i needed it to allow for shipping time. i'm glad i did...  it didn't arrive until 2 days after the expected delivery time. the seller did respond to me quickly when i contacted them.
260390	love these tops for layering. they are comfortable and i wear them all the time. they do run a little long and will shrink slightly in the wash. overall a great value.
260438	much much cheaper than converse and you can't tell the difference. comes with white and black laces, zips up the side so you don't have to worry about tying them every time. my daughter wears them to school every day and they still look great.
260444	knowing that is was a cheap sneaker i order a whole size up , 10, and it fit like a size 8. i returned
260478	we're very happy with the fit and feel of these carter's long sleeve onesies.  i just needed normal shirts for my daughter to wear at school/day care and these fit the bill.  these are pretty and fit well and 'normal' and clean easily too in the wash.
260526	love this ring. i wear it practically everyday. great ring for an even better cost!! i will definitely buy again.
260536	i couldn't believe how fast they arrived - way before their actual delivery due date. i bought the purple, really a super gorgeous deep, bright lavender. i'd say they are true to color picture, but a bit more vibrant (of course!) in person. i am not even a fan of purple, but i just loved the very &#34;spring&#34; bright color - and i've never seen purple boots quite like these.i have wide feet and find they were true to my size. i had a pair of chinese laundry that i bought for way more than these and they lasted about a month before ripping. simply for the color and fit, these already are worth the price. if i run into any wear problems, i'll update, but if you're the type that gets all giddy over simple colorful beautiful things, get these (in the purple!) - they'll make you smile no matter what the weather!!
260578	the fit is fine; they matched the top i wanted to wear them with.  the problem is that they have a strong odor (might be some type of chemical or dye) and so far i can not get rid of that smell.  i have washed them and soaked them in downy fabric softener.  i have laid them out in the sun.  nothing helps.  if i can't get the smell out, i will not wear them.
260638	these sunglasses are pretty nice.  i got them on sale during a lightning deal for $37.99 so they were a good deal.  i keep them in the car as a spare in case i forget my oakley fuelcell glasses, and that's the only reason i didn't return them.  they are shaped funny in my opinion, so they look worse than my other glasses.  they also feel pretty cheap for the original price tag.  i definitely would not buy these for the current price of $120!
260647	i sent for three colors. i was not happy with them, and tried to return them.read my  review on the coral one.
260685	this is the best gift i ever purchased for someone under 20 bucks i will reccoment this to everyone who needs a gold shiney chain my boyfriend was so happy and luckly he didnt ask how much he was so excited when he got as a monthaversary gift
260686	i love these.  they certainly look to be much more expensive than they are.  they are my christmas gift to me, and anyone who received them as a gift would be delighted with them.  i am fighting the urge to buy more.  they exceeded my expectations.  i love gold and there is nothing here not to love.
260711	i purchased this for my boyfriend sz 12, it didnt fit..so the company sent me a sz 13 (which was perfect) for 1/2 the price. they were wonderful..the ring is very handsome and looks good on his hand. (and he loves it)  i would recommend this company to anyone..the ring is made very well  :)
260721	gorgeous and i simply love all the elegant designs in this necklace. it will be beautiful to wear during the holidays and every day there after. i am glad i bought it.
260733	this feather is so cute that i was awestruck. all my friends and everyone that has seen it were amazed when i told them how much it cost. shipping is way too high, but all put together, it still looks so much more expensive than what i paid. the chain is long the feather is big and very elegant. i was concerned that it may look gaudy, but it wasn't a bit gaudy. i wish it had matching earrings. i bought 2 pieces from this seller and both the pieces are amazing.
260803	i really like this shirt, it's thicker and better quality than what i was expecting. i wear a men's l/m and the us-l fit me really well and comfortably, not too tight, not too loose. i might buy it in a us-m next time, though, as i do like my clothes to fit tightly.that said.. what i recieved was not what i ordered. i ordered the 3/4 sleeve length but got the full length sleeved version. the length of the sleeve was the main reason i ordered the shirt. so, that was disappointing.  i didn't contact the seller, however, so can't comment on customer survice. it just didn't seem worth the hassle to me.
260820	beautiful colors and nice fabric but i am usually a 13 juniors..i ordered a 2x large b/c of reviews i read and it barely fits...also the sides are almost completely open-have to wear cami underneath
260826	thanks to everyone's review, i ordered the shirt 2 sizes bigger than i normally would have - fits perfectly! very cute shirt, well made. a bit see thru especially if stretched to tight. its made out of 92% polyester and 8% spandex. overall i love the shirt and will be buying it in another color.
260860	...and cute! love this, also bought it a pair in black. beautifully made and well finished. a must for this summer!
260930	i received this necklace and the green is not as shown online. its more of a light pastel green, not as vibrant as shown online. nice necklace though.
260942	if you buy this item and it does not fit, you will need to pay return shipping to thailand.  if you're like every other female on the planet, you probably need to try things on.  well, it's going to cost you $40 to return it, so you might as well keep it, even if you look ridiculous in it.  sadly, the dress is actually really cute, just not flattering for my figure.  i gave this dress 1 star because of the terrible service at koh koh. they responded quickly to my concern about return shipping costs...but essentially said that they don't care.
260947	adorable and washes very well!  my little boy is darling in it, & though he is growing quickly & out on over a pound, it still fits!
260961	cute dress,  runs a tad small.  i'm 5&#34;4&#34; and weigh 135.  i ordered a med.  i think a large would have been too big in the neck and shoulders.  the med. could have been a tad looser in the hips, but it's ok.  maybe i'll loose a pound or two before summer. quality is good and the price also.
260962	4 stars for the size-runs big. i ordered m and i usually wear m( 5'5, 149) the dress was too big for me so i gave it to my mom who wears l, it fits her perfectly! it looks very beautiful on her. i am glad i do not have to return it.
260983	i cheaped out and got what i payed for. these are very thin. if you just need something cheap, that's ok, they don't seem like they're gonna fall apart or anything, but i personally bought them to tie dye, which i wouldn't recommend them for. being so thin, the dye really bled throughout them and got muddled, and i don't expect them to ever get that nice soft used bandana feel to them, they're just rough and stiff.
261010	the problem with these socks is after they go to the dryer, then they get smaller and fit somehow smaller. also the ankle rim hold tends to get loose easily. but are the best for long walk cushioning of your feet. i hope they correct the issues mentioned.
261013	off and on i have tried various brands of socks but keep on coming back to thorlos.  they are by far the most comfortable and cushy socks of any i have tried.  the are not at all binding and fit perfect.  love them!
261055	i use these as nursing shoes. i'm not sure if they'd be up to the challenge of running shoes, but they've got a nice wide and even base for support when standing for long hours and were comfortable my first 12hr shift straight out of the box.my only very slight issue is that i'm not fond of medium to short laces and would have preferred longer ones so i could wear the shoes as loose or tight as i want (the laces are obviously meant to be pulled fairly tight for a good knot and i prefer my shoes loose and roomy).
261056	i love running shoes, and definately asics is  a really good brand to  start running, it came on time, they fit incredible .new and the  color is great.
261138	this skirt is even prettier than i expected. i got the beige, 100. my size range is usually a size 4. i like low rise so i ordered a little larger so it could be a lower fit. this worked perfectly! highly recommend, order came faster than expected, as well.
261159	love these socks. nice and warm with some compression qualities. even stay nicely on my large calves. did however start to shorten going through the wash. so maybe try not drying them. that's the only reason a start was taken away
261255	shipping was standard. i wear a 34d and bought a large, the fit is a little big but still fits; a wash should shrink it just enough to make it fit perfectly. i like the texture of the bra and the removable pads. maybe i was expecting too much, but i feel like i should have bought a medium
261328	well made ring. it looks just like the picture. got lots of compliments on it. i recommend this as a good purchase
261332	this ring is a great buy if you don't mind a dingy-looking silver. i know stainless steel doesn't shine like sterling silver, but this is almost gray looking. just doesn't pop out on your hand at all. i got one for my daughter, too, as she wanted something with both silver and gold in it--but i had to return. neither of us liked it.
261334	a beautiful ring. a bit too large for my hand. i ordered a size 9 for my index finger , size was right on but the raised dome just a bit too much on my small hand . i was going to return ring , promptly heard from manufacturer , they sent me information on how to return, but i needed to download the return info with a code, i do not have access to a copier . i informed manufacturer and they stated that they would mail it to me.
261337	the gold in the ring is darker than it appears in picture but it came fast and it's cheap. i guess it's a good stand in ring but the gold looks so dingy you wouldn't want to give it as a gift or anything. i'm not sure if it tarnishes or dyes fingers because i just took this as a loss and bought another ring.
261342	simply magnificent rings by this dealer! i can't get over the quality of them. they are really stunning, the look, feel and surface looks the part - looks like i've paid hundreds - the question is - how long will they continue to look this way? in any case - very satisfied!
261383	it fits great and its comfortable great for work or weekend causal wear.i bought it black too. you will not be disappointed.
261394	i love these, i have nothing bad to say they are the perfect size, look very classy and i have gotten many compliments on them.
261401	quality is fantastic, but i do not have the hips and backside to fill the pants in. they are cut wider in those areas.
261493	i have women's size 8 to 8.5 medium width feet and these socks are a bit tight. they are very soft and seem to be well made, just on the small side. if you have smaller feet these will be great socks; if you have larger or wider feet these may not be the right choice for you. i donated these to a local shelter rather than return them.
261537	it ugly, and it was a hastle to return it. never will do nusiness with them again. sorry but i didnt like it at all
261542	i was afraid this jacket would look cheap, but it doesn't at all. i ordered a medium. it will be perfect for fall. i love it! would definitely order from this seller again.
261544	i would return this if i wasn't leaving the country the next day. it looks nothing like the picture. it fits big just not happy with this purchase
261681	i ordered the magenta but it was burgundy instead even though the tag says magenta. i am not a fan of burgundy or i might have kept it. customer service e-mailed me to apologize and explained the wrong label was placed on the packaging. i was issued a refund promptly.
261690	these are terrible.  on the model it is shows the dress being mid thigh.  but as one walks it keeps riding up.  i bought these for slips to wear under short dresses & they do not work.
261715	i wanted to try out the peasant look because i think it's adorable, but the neck line does nothing for my shoulders.ladies, if you have broad shoulders, this style of dress is not for you. learn from my mistake or you'll just end up as disappointed as i was.... and with a dress that's not really the color shown (the red is darker) and doesn't smell all that pleasant.
261722	wanted a skirt that hit at the proper waist, for that hourglass look - unfortunately this guy comes off a little foofy, doesn't really emphasize a trim waist. (about me: 5'7&#34;, 27 in. waist 35 in. hip) also a bit on the short side if put at the waist, at least for those who do not love their thighs enough to share them with everybody.foofy and short made me feel like a dumpy ballerina, a sad sensation. me and the skirt were off to a rocky start.fortunately, this bad boy stretches enough at the waistband that it fits well just above the hip, and then the length is right. it looks so cute like that, the trim waist (all by itself) and then the flare of the skirt starts from the swell of the hip, creates a great line. can't tuck a blouse into it, but a blouse worn untucked with a broad belt at proper waist and you've got that classic outline anyhow. great quality fabric, and color, i think we're gonna make this relationship work after all.
261725	i can't believe how great these earrings are for the price. i was worried they would come in and look cheap but they were just the opposite. these earrings look as if i paid 100$ for them and i paid 6 shipping and all!  i've gotten many compliments in them every time i wear them.
261756	they're so pretty.and ive been sleeping and showering in them for days with no color change or loss of sturdiness.my boyfriend loves them,the shipping was great.i'll definetely be ordering more.
261780	they are absolutely stunning and at such a great price.  not flimsy - well made.  if you like cat eye / vintage / retro sunglasses - then you'll love these!
261840	i bought these shoes on a whim.  my feet are very difficult to buy comfortable shoes for. i didn't make a mistake buying these.  they are so well made, nice leather and can be worn well with anything.  first pair of shoes i have purchased and don't even think about them while i am wearing them.  the &#34;most&#34; comfortable shoes ever.  planning on buying another for myself in a diff color and another of the black for my mom.  she has crazy feet like mine.  i hope they feel as good to her.
261855	it's great color and material but it runs small.  i am big chested and this won't close for me.  i plan to wear it open w/dresses or blouses.  i love the color.
261857	i chose a 3 star rating because the jacket didn't really meet my expectations. i was looking forward to a cute blazer that is boyfriend cut. instead, i received this overly baggy but tight in the armpits jacket, i don't think i will ever wear it. i need to look into returns.the jacket doesn't roll up like the picture shows it. i tried and was left with a mess.if you are looking for a decent blazer, please look elsewhere or else you may be disappointed.
261871	i usually wear a medium or large for shirts and always purchase a large in shawls, cardigans, and sweaters just for the extra room. i wanted a lightweight shawl and found this one, and couldn't beat the price. it is a little on the small side, especially in my shoulders. it'll work good while wearing a tank top but that's about it. for $7.69 it was worth every penny, but i'm glad it wasn't anymore than that. i would suggest going a size up with this item if you want to wear it with other things besides a tank top.
261893	i don't like the shape of the ring at all, it's squarish and not very feminine besides the stone design. the band isn't square but the stone setting (i guess that's what it's called) is too blunt, instead of wrapping around the circular band it kind of jets out on each side. it doesn't look that way in the picture. it took forever to get here, probably because it's from china. the green stones do not sparkle or have much dimension, they look kind of bleh in my opinion but the clear stones look nice enough. they do sparkle and look kind of pretty. the color of the gold is pretty too, similar to the pic. i'd say overall the description and picture is true except that it's squarish as i mentioned. i wouldn't recommend it for that reason, i think it ruins the entire ring.
261953	love, love, love this purse and i'm a purse nut. good size, fits my iphone, 7 inch kindle, wallet, and my little extras. it has zipper closer plus a flip over which is heavy enough you don't need go use the zipper. snaps easy, i let the chain part hang and use the strap and it adds to the look. great price, fast shipping,  would tell anyone, and do about this great purse. hope it lasts a long time. the smell of leather hits you when you first use it, it's great!!!
262025	awesome shipping. i got the medium (in two colors) and am 5'6&#34; 120lbs. i hate too tight pants. these are perfect for me. they stay up no problem. they actually enhance my shape, i can sweat in them and they dry super quick, i am very surprised i like these as much as i do. for 19$ you really cannot beat this deal. i realize the big t store carries champion, but i hate going in there & coming out broke-lol! i appreciate a good deal on well made workout clothes. fyi though if you are super fit you may want to size down to a small if you are gauging size from my review. i am still a bit flabby post baby. ;)good job amazon-*back pats* keep on bringing hip wearable workout clothes as very good prices.
262071	i love this bra, i ordered two in different colors. it is comfortable and fits just right. i took out the extra padding as i don't need it and it gives plenty of lift without it.
262181	you can't beat these onsies for looks and ease in changing diapers, etc.  i don't think any new mother can have enough of them.  the price is fantastic, too.  launders well, too.
262236	i wear a size 7.  so i ordered a size 7.  they fit perfectly. the strap around the ankle is snug, but not tight.  love that it has a zipper to get the shoe on and off.  i bought these for a summer vacation, but figured that i would wear them a little bit before hand to find out if they are a comfortable fit and so far, they are!  i can walk around pretty comfortably.  stairs for me are a little crazy, but i am sure that is just me. the shoes are exactly as pictured and i think that these can go with a variety of outfits from dress pants, jeans to skirts or dresses.
262277	i haev only worn them once, so i am not sure on how long they last.  but they are very warm and comfortable.  i hope they last.  the colors are nice as well.  simple and elegant
262309	love these boots ....i got them right on time ....love love love themill be buying another pair soon, thanks
262399	i love the colors in this skirt and purchased 2 tops to go w/it before i even received the skirt! highly recommend!
262429	i have several pieces from patty boutique and all of them have been great.  the styling and workmanship are perfect, and i especially love the quality of the jersey fabric.  this long foldover-waist skirt is just great, because it closely skims the body without clinging like some cheaper jerseys, and the fabric has plenty of stretch so as to not restrict your stride when you walk.  the foldover waist style allows for some variation in the length, meaning you can have it go nearly to the floor or above the ankles depending on what shoes you're wearing. overall this is very flattering and well made.
262445	this did not fit well. fits small and was just odd feeling on the inside. it is a nice looking shirt but would've been nicer if it fit.
262457	slightly different color than in the picture. i was dissappointed by that but otherwise it was perfect. i get the best compliments on this shirt!
262464	nicer than the picture. order it in blue, and it was wrapped like it should have been in a designer store. way better quality than the picture lets on. has three different big zipper areas in all, and inside the middle one, their is a place to put your phone, and other little side pockets. there is a small zipper in the back, right near the top, another place to store something small. it's big enough to fit books in too, and whatever else you'd like.
262473	i really was very skeptical about these when i ordered. however, since the price is more than reasonable, i figured it was not much of a risk to take. well, i am glad i did! i am 5'10, and of normal built, neither fat nor skinny. they fit me like a glove, and the legs are long enough to reach my ankles, just as the photo shows. i really love the silky, smooth material of these pants. they are absolutely opaque, so i can wear them to the yoga class. the fabric is &#34;fat&#34; enough to give them a &#34;gym-pantsy&#34; feel (not as if i wore stockings) and that is what i hoped for.shipping, by the way, was quite fast. i ordered them on april 3 and got them, from china, on april 15. this morning, i wore them the first time to my yoga class, and the women, including the teacher, immediately said how much they loved the look of these. i cannot say by now how they will hold up in the long run, but if you don't read more from me about them in the future, you can assume all is well.based on this good experience, i went ahead and ordered a bunch more, in different colors and designs.
262539	this is a classic vintage set. it will go a long way towards setting a standard for future additions to my collections.
262547	if your like me and have lost of bulky necklaces, then this you can only hang one necklace per hook. i ended up having to take out the trays in order to hang all my necklaces.overall it is very functional, sleek, and well built.
262579	my boyfriend found this one and asked me to get it. he loves the way it looks on me and would like for me to buy another one.great shirt!
262592	i bought this as a gift for my granddaughter, now she thinks i am amazing, thank you helping me to be the 'cool' grandma.
262765	these rings are pretty , they don't look cheap and have a good patina to them. they are strong and unbendable.
262819	not very cute in my opinion!very smalland not very well made lookingi would pass on it if i was you
262834	bought for my daughter for christmas.  ended up just giving to her before hand because i didn't even know if she'd where it. would not buy again.
262864	as what i said on teh first and second items, i didnt get this item yet...so i can say anything. thank you.
262899	both the blue and bronze rhinestones  are very pretty. the earrings are light weight. the earrings look just like the image shown.
262900	i purchased these cute earrings for my niece to go with an art deco pendant and necklace. i wish there was a matching bracelet. excellent price for the quality and quantity!
262911	again very cute these are so cute. i would recommend this product to everyone. the shipping was extremely fast. they were just as expected but like i said they are so cute daughter just loved them.
262942	got here fast from china... cute as described...my young daughter loved these..............would consider ordering again to give as little gift to a young  girl....
262945	no complaints at all about these! they are actually nicer in person than in the picture. the blue ones are beautiful!
263122	i don't like the style, it's not as expected from looking at the picture. too large on the waist, ok on the top.
263148	it looks fine. i imagine that over time the holes will rip and i'll eventually either have to get another belt or lose weight to keep wearing it. that little loop will fly off when you change buckles. keep it in mind and try not to lose it.
263234	it is a different looking watch and people  think you just have a bracelet on your arm.  for the price it is a good buy.
263257	these gloves were way to small for a adult woman with normal size hands and arms.  they can only be worn by a very thin woman.  a regular sized person is a no go.  i gave them 3 stars because for the price and quality they were good.  i was able to give them to someone and they used them with good out come.  buyer be ware with the size.
263262	these two necklaces will make a wonderful christmas gift for my two grand daughters.the angel fish necklaces are beautiful, and the girls will love them.
263263	its so cute, i love that the fishes bubbles are little pearls it makes it more unique and special, really glad i bought it.
263278	big, bold, bright, sturdy, and the bubbles look like pearls. the chain is long and well put together. fits in palm of hand.
263285	two of them broke within one day. the chain that came with the charms broke within one day of each other.
263623	i really like the bracelet! the deer isn't as detailed as i honestly would have liked, but it's still quite cute.
263738	no bow the chain is different but that's good because its stronger than the one pictured... i am like the other lady... i want my bow! also the basket is just a weight not a basket it looks like a padlock dangling from the basket hate it ruins this whole piece it would be cute if they put a little baskets from it as pictured. this is going back it's too dissapointing you cannot even tell it's a hot air balloon with the stupid padlock dangling from it.
263774	of course the pink ribbon bow isn't there. the paint on my balloon isn't straight. looks as though a child painted it. plus my basket is upside down,  which made me think a tassel was supposed  to be attached.
263834	i love this necklace.the chain is long enough to have it sit really well and the cat is exactly as pictured.it's a very adorable item.
263930	this bracelet is so pretty it looks like it should be at forever 21 for $14 not a few bucks on amazon!! im gonna order like 5 more for stocking stuffers!
263939	giving as a part of a gift, but it is very pretty. the bracelet is on the smaller size, so might be snug. the price is perfect!
263941	i received the bracelet and it was beautiful and fits perfectly well on my wrist. great for the price and is a must buy.
264114	it does come from hong kong so it takes it a month to get here, with that being said, it's really nice. the chain is long & it's cheap but you can add another chain if you want. this is a great gift for any girl or woman.
264248	this is the &#34;sexiest&#34; patty shirt i own, and i like it in general, but it's also the least flattering of my patty shirts. i think it's because the mid-section has 2 layers of fabric, actually thickening my middle instead of slimming it. i still like it with a flowy skirt, but it makes me look pregnant with pants.
264268	"i came upon this top when just looking through some suggested offerings by amazon.  i liked the style and look of this top but hesitated when i saw it was one size fits all.  that usually means something i would ""swim"" in.  the pricing of this top made me decide to give it a try and i love it! it is well-made with quality fabric and i do not swim in it.  i would have to recommend that if you are a larger woman, maybe size 12 and above, i would not get this. it is perfect for me and matches my casual style.  the turquoise blue version is quite flattering to my skin tone.  i highly recommend this top and the brand sakkas."
264301	these are very comfortable, darling flat ballet shoes.  they fit well, not too tight around the ankle...perfect black flats with a special look,  different.
264316	"i really wish that fiesta formals had supplied their measuring system for this dress since amazon's wasn't as great to rely on. i'm 5'7"", dimensions 37,27,39 bust 34d and i ordered a medium in green. the dress is too long, even in heels, and the bust is too large for me. i'm going to have to sew on the straps to make sure i don't have a wardrobe malfunction.when the dress arrived it was very wrinkled from shipping and the fit made me so disappointed. i didn't feel pretty or sexy at all and wanted to return it immediately. then i decided to iron it to see if it would make a difference. it looked a bit better. i don't know if the small would fit better and i don't want to take the chance by returning it and having to pay for the shipping to do so. i'm just hoping it will work for my event.bottom line, if you want to make sure a formal looks good on you then you have to go to a store and try it on for yourself. if i had been able to try it on, i wouldn't have bought it."
264321	i love these boots and i'm wearing them now.  they are very stylish and comfy.  the only negative for me is that i noticed they make my feet appear too way long i had owned several pair of pointed toed shoes but for some reason these make my feet look like 10s.  i wear a size 8 but in boots i always order or buy 8 1/2's so the fit is great, i can walk in them during my hour long leisure/exercise walk (which i did do last week in them) and my feet were all good.  i needed a pair of stylish riding boots that i could walk in...these were the perfect solution!
264376	my daughter likes owls & i saw this i just had to get them! the post for the earrings  bend to easily though.
264508	the fold over is great -- you can make it a midi or a maxi. i'm in retail and have to wear all black.  the price was perfect and i can just throw it in the washer and dryer!1
264519	hot. my boyfriend loves it. i really don't think i'll be able to wear it out in public, but perhaps i'm just too modest given my size. i thought i had purchase an xxl but the size says xl. not worth a return for an almost fit. i'll just diet. i really do love this suit, just wish it had some more tata support, but how can you when the v goes to near belly button?! :)
264523	this jacket fits really well, is comfortable, and looks just like the photo.  the jacket adds an edgy military look to almost anything you wear it with and looks great with a skirt, leggings, and heels.  i'd have to say i did get a lot more compliments from guys vs. girls and most guys assumed i was cosplaying.
264575	the website indicates this has pockets. it doesn't have pockets at all. the dress itself is made from a satin material, but then it has a sheer piece of material sewn to the front of it. it looks aweful! it hangs funny, and looks absolutely horrible. looks nothing like what the picture shows, or describes.
264576	if i can get my rite size i will gv tis dress a 5 cos its cute jus 2 small i wnt tis dress & the price waz grt
264580	i just received this shirt a couple days ago (ordered the one in black) and really love it! it's a very sexy shirt without being too revealing, there isn't any low neckline causing cleavage to be seen. the most skin you'll show in this shirt are your shoulders! it's also true to size.  i usually wear a xs/s depending on the shirt, and since this shirt only comes in s, m, and l, i ordered the small and it fits perfectly, and is also very flattering!  you can dress it up by wearing a nice pencil skirt, or dress it down by wearing jeans, shorts, pants, or even a casual skirt. the only problem i had at first when trying it on were the sleeves. you kind of have to figure out how to adjust it to fit the way it should. you have to put the shirt on, then criscross the sleeves. as i said though, once you understand how to put it on properly it gets easier the next time. i absolutely recommend this top and also this company! i adore patty boutique and have never had any problems ordering from them. they are very customer friendly and the shirt actually arrived about a week or so before it was supposed to!
264594	i ordered a medium, the sleeves were a little tight and after i get it over my boobs it looks cute. i like how the bottom of it is different lengths.
264611	this does not work for larger breasts!  i wear a 34 d and this did nothing for me.  very awkward product.  perhaps it might work for a smaller bust.
264642	i can not live without these tank tops! they go perfect with every outfit or just layered by themselves! the fit is perfect. i recommend you only hang dry them! my previous ones (when i was a large) lasted me about 2 years without falling apart!
264668	i have always struggled to find a pair of comfortable heels since my feet are a half size difference. earlier this summer, i bought a pair and inserted foot petals in the right heel (smaller of the 2 feet) and i can't even tell i'm wearing heals. they are literally so comfy, which lead me to go back to the bandolino brand when looking for boots for this fall/winter. i returned these black ones in exchange for the same exact style in the brown/cognac leather (which are beautiful) and they too are ridiculously comfortable. will continue to support this brand!!
264670	i usually wear an 8.5 and bought a 9 based on other reviews - i did not need to.  even with bulky socks, i have plenty of room.  i bought these for the color (cognac) and the lower heel to wear on a trip to napa.  they were perfect.  the leather is soft but does show wear (like riding boots normally do). very comfortable and they both look and feel more expensive than they were.  i am considering buyting them in another color, but will order true to size.
264675	per their measuring guidelines, i bought a 38 ddd.  however, it seems to fit as a minimizing bra, and feels too small.  nevertheless, it was actually comfortable once i got in it (have to struggle a bit to get on and off due to snug fit.)  might just need to go up a cup size - the 38 band is snug, but not tight or uncomfortable.
264688	i was scared i would not fit into this when i read other reviews advising to order it 2 sizes bigger than one actually is only after i had already ordered it. the only problem with sizing were the sleeves which were too short. what i did was to simply role the sleeves up my elbow and everything looks good now. i guess i'll have to keep wearing it that way.
264725	this dress is completely shapeless! looks good in the picture but looked absolutely horrendous when i tried it on. it looked like a potato sack. had to return it.
264728	this item is a beautiful color and i love it!  it fits nicely and is very cool and comfortable.  the only problem is a slight dye defect i only noticed after washing.
264787	these are awesome leggings!  under armour is my favorite!  great quality, wear well, fit great!  i am a size 6 and ordered the m and they fit perfectly.
264799	i bought this for my wife thinking it would be something comfortable that she could wear to the beach, but also a little sexy. it's more like a moo moo (or mumu, however you spell it). she's 5'3&#34; and about 115 pounds. it looks like she's wearing a tent when she puts it on. it hangs almost to her ankles. the woman in that picture must be over 6 feet tall because the dress just comes to her knees.in the various pictures here on amazon the models must be holding the excess fabric behind them where you can't see it. if it is just left to hang the dress looks like a shapeless potato sack. a very pretty potato sack, but a potato sack none the less.
264835	i'm impressed with the quality of this dress.  the fabric has a bit of stretch and it's not see-through.  i'm 5'7&#34;, 135 lbs, smaller on the top than bottom, and i ordered a medium.  it fits okay, but i think a small would have been a bit better for me, because it's generously proportioned on the bottom.  it hits at the bottom of my knees.it looks very much like the picture, so i can't complain, but the fit isn't the most flattering.  it's sort of shapeless.  having said that, it's a basic piece and good quality. i can see this dress as being very versatile, working well on vacation, at the office, and multi-seasons, and i'll keep it because of that.
264843	i like the color and i was just looking for a comfortable dress to wear around the house or do errands with my son. a little too long as am only 4' 11&#34;
264845	"like most other reviewers, i am very happy with the quality and fit of this dress.  i'm 5/8"", 140#, curvy with 34dd bust and usually wear a size 8 or 10, and this dress fit me perfectly in size m, just a little snug in the bust (not uncomfortable).  the fabric is not too thin, so it drapes nicely and does not reveal bulges.  i like it so much that i bought it in 3 colors - black, charcoal (it's dark gray), and olive (it's a true olive color, and a dark shade).  this dress is a great buy.  if they had a m in blue, i would buy a 4th!  the only thing i don't like is that little embroidered wave thing on the left hem.  i intend to wear the olive dress to work with an olive & beige linen print jacket, and the wave thing does not fly.  i'm going to see if the tailor can remove it without damage.update:  i have to amend my comment about the quality - it is fair.  after washing and having to iron this dress (very wrinkly even when dried on permapress cycle), i now see that the side seams and the hem are crooked.  i still like the dress but would rather have paid a little more for straighter seams."
264871	i wanted something very thin and cool for all this southwest heat.  this blouse was perfect...its a hand wash item that washed up extremely well.  it needed a light iron after an over night drip dry and that was pretty easy too.
264892	i like it i ordered it in black and red...i will be giving one to a slim friend who i think will look great in it!
264894	the top of this dress ties in a very weird way and the material feels a bit rough and itchy.  if it wasnt for the quality of the material the dress would not be so bad.
264898	i'm 5'9&#34; and slim. this is way too short for a &#34;long&#34; dress on me since it stops just past my calf. it also comes with a very skinny belt, which also looks great on a petite girl but...not on me. it looks awesome on the cute petite girl in the picture but on me i look like i have no fashion sense headed to go to church with my 10 kids.
264914	i have wider-ish shoulders. this shirt kinda bunches at the shoulders for me and my coworkers have all joked about me wearing shoulder pads. i imagine it would fit someone with less shoulder just fine. it's also a little short for me, and comes untucked because its such a smooth material. i like the shirt though and it came with a fabric belt... not entirely sure what its for.also it doesnt really fold over on the sleeves like the picture... but maybe my forearms are just too thick. it is what it is haha
264960	i have this style of shoe from other makers, and this one is definitely more comfortable (in the sole). i am very pleased! they should make more in different colors!
264974	these shoes are extremely rough on the upper foot.  this is velcro after all but i thought it would be comfortable on the side that touches the foot.  it was like shards of plastic sticking my feet anywhere it touched.  how anyone could give this shoe a good rating is beyond me. the footbed was comfortable and cushy.  the straps worse feeling than i can say.
264977	nice looking, flexible shoe that is true to size but the vamp hits at an odd spot on my slightly wide foot creating a pinched feeling below the toes.  the color is a light brown/like chocolate milk but it also has olive accents on the &#34;mesh&#34; part which i couldn't see in the photos.  the ankle strap does not have velcro - just a single snap - which was a bit loose on me though the looseness didn't cause any problems walking.
265016	these pants are incredibly flattering, especially for those who have a bit of a belly. they are form fitting, comfy and little bit stretchy so i was able to work comfortable in them. i was surprised to see that there was no zipper or button but it worked out for me either way.
265019	interesting model. good quality as expected. i have ordered size 8 (i wear 8 usually) in black. i think it is 6 or a little less.
265247	it is so cute and fun, fits great and i get a ton of compliments when i wear it. the smell is from a plastic coating covering the graphic that peels off. the graphic is still fine underneath and the smell is gone, i have washed and worn mine (wash it inside out to protect the graphic!) and the graphic still looks great with no smell!
265252	buyer beware. this thing is huge! looks absolutly adorable with boots and leggings tho! loooooooooooove it!!! im happy with it! id try to shrink it in the was a little if i could but reading the reviews &#34;dont put it in the dryer&#34;  ill stick to handwash cold :)love the cute shirt -worth the $$
265277	"i was a bit afraid ordering this dress (in black) that, since it was a medium and i usually wear a small or x-small, that it would be too loose in all the wrong places. let me tell you that is not the case, it fits just right and the zipper on the lower back makes it mold beautifully on the waist. you definitely have to be into the peplum trend because this - as the picture shows - is a peplum, but a nicely done one. the quality is actually very good, particularly for the price. it is on the shorter side (for my 5'4"" stature it hits about two palms above the knee), but not revealing your behind. it comes with a basic thong. with that open back it's impossible to wear a traditional bra with it, so definitely not a dress for the modest. but overall, very stylish with the lace and sexy. also, the lace looks quite robust and it's unlikely it will snag. i really like it!"
265358	fit is chinese. they are smaller than giant american. well made coat. warm classy cute, cheap, over all it is great.
265379	"let me start by saying i am 5' 5"" 150 lbs with a 33"" inseam.purchased the med-tall. i had great hopes for these leggings but they did not cut it. first just barely came to my ankles even though it says they will fit someone 5' 11"" and up to 195 lbs. they were transparent not opaque so you will need to wear a long top. they came up too high in the front and too low in the back. after an hour they were falling down at the waist. in general just a poor fit. will be searching for something else as winter is approaching."
265403	"i recently received a pair of these fun, retro-style sunglasses in exchange for an honest review.  the first thing i thought was how totally 1950s they look.  i love the retro look, so this appeals to me.  unfortunately, i sometimes find that ""fun"" sunglasses equate to poor fitting and cheaply made products.  not so with these.  they are thick, sturdy, flexible, and amazingly well fitting.  as a matter of fact, they fit better than any other sunglasses i've owned.  i have an average size head, and they sit perfectly on my head and nose, the earpieces are sturdy and comfortable, and they fit snugly yet not tight.it recently snowed a lot here in minnesota, and my husband and i were out cutting firewood and shoveling snow.  he wore safety glasses, and i wore these.  they were a huge help in blocking out the glare of the bright white snow, and they stayed securely in place while i worked.the last pair of retro-style sunglasses i had were adorable, but they didn't fit me well.  they ended up being passed on to my granddaughter for a back-to-the-50s look at school.  i'm keeping these and plan to use them often.  and since i can replace them at such a reasonable price, i won't have to stress over tossing them in my purse or glove compartment or losing them while shopping."
265451	most pjs are just way too long i find for petites.  even in small or xsmall the lengths need to be hemmed and who wants to bother hemming pjs.  i like the look too, no cutesy juvenile design on them.  these are perfect. so perfect that when i opened the package in front of a family member, they wanted to keep them.  i gave them up and immediately ordered the same for me again which i should have in a few days.
265461	these are nice socks, thin but warm. i didn't find them to be itchy at all. hopefully they will wear well.
265467	kimono arrived on time and was exactly as described. i'm always a little leary buying clothing online because the sizes can vary. i found this kimono true to size.
265468	i purchased this kimono robe in red and i love it. fit true to size. runs short, i'm 5'4'' and it just covers my butt. it's nice quality for the price,and i love the color and design, it's fun to rock after a shower!
265481	i was nervous about the one-size-fits-all, but these fit well.  they are a little long on me, but i am only 5'4&#34; and they aren't too bunchy.  for the regular weight, however, i am not a big fan of the material.  it is like very thick tights, and i would prefer some cotton and less of a sheen.  still, they are opaque and comfortable, and a really good value for the low price.
265483	buuuut they're more of a nude color so for me, it looks like i'm not wearing pants & i'm not that type of person to just walk around with a tee with them. & it came in a two pack so that was cool.
265496	the legs fit just fine, but up around my bottom and around my waist they are just too loose, they don't even touch my waist because they are so loose. they are definitely meant to be plus. guess i should have noticed that little word at the end of the title.
265502	i got these really quick which i thought was pretty cool they came in the regular usps so not fedex or ups.they are super comfortable which is why i gave them a four star the only negative thing i have to say about these are that when they say thin they mean it.i would buy again for longer shirts and sweaters but not if im going to wear just a tank top.they do look great though
265521	d&k fashion 5 out of 5 &#34;great leggings i'm not the skinniest women they fit great love the way they feel great price looks great with a skirt and boots love amazon they came in 4 days great price&#34;
265547	i got the thick winter fleece ones, and they are very warm and comfortable.  the quality of these leggings is amazing and you cannot beat the price.  they have a very high waistline, they pull up all the way over my stomach, which i like because it sucks everything in.  some others do not like the high waistline.  however, i am constantly pulling them up.  they sag at the crotch every time i get up.  so that kind of sucks having to hike them up in front of people all the time.  other than that, i love them.
265643	i bought these shoes because i read they have memory foam.  it does what is expected. but not as comfortable as my other flats. jambu's are much better walking shoe. if you don't plan on walking too far they are a good shoe. if looking for only style. they are pretty. the only thing i do have a issue is the shoe liner that goes on the foot if you are going bare foot comes out with your foot each time.
265674	comfortable shoe.  i ordered my usual size and it fits fine. it's great for spring and looks great with skirts, linen pants for work, or with jeans and shorts for a more casual look.
265684	i find crocs comfortable for everyday wear, and these sandals are no exception.  these are attractive, too, with a realistic-looking 'cork' layer.when i first put them on, i was afraid the non-adjustable straps weren't tight enough, but as i've worn the shoes i find they're fine.  in fact, i've just ordered another pair in a different color.
265791	"i received this today and it didn't take too long considering it's sent from china.  nonetheless, there were some differences from the picture.  i'm 5' 10"" 158 pounds and ordered the medium.  it fits just fine, but is much shorter than indicated in the picture.  it ends about an inch and half to two inches above the knee.  as i wanted this for work, this was disappointing.  i ordered the blue and it's a much lighter blue than in the picture (which is fine, it's a nice blue) but the dress isn't lined, so it's slightly see through in the leg area with the slit up the back.the price was low enough for me to overlook these issues, but if the dress was lined and longer, it would have been great.  i'm actually thinking of cutting off the bottom and making it in to a top.  i can still wear it if i wear a slip underneath and not to work.  i guess you get what you pay for..."
265819	i got two of these. they fit as expected and are so cute. you can't beat them for the price!
265869	every time i wear these i get compliments from other women.  they are so light it is like i don't even have on shoes.  i just adore everything about them.  arrived ahead of schedule, packaging and product in perfect condition.  i ordered a 9 because i am a 8 1/2 and have one fat foot, these fit perfectly.
265870	love the color. very lightweight. sturdy materials used. can be used for both gym and casual. would definitely buy again.
265903	"i really liked this dress its super cute! unfortunately i'm too tall at 5'9"" to wear this dress, luckily i have some pretty tiny friends. the customer service is fantastic and they contacted me right away and even gave me a refund for it which i really appreciated!"
265904	let me start off by saying this is an extremely beautiful dress. i love it. i had ordered a size 6 when it was available. i got it in a size late which was extremely way too big for me. i tried to get a refund and the company was giving me the worst time with a return. they didn't care the order was wrong and that i was wrong. it was also damaged and they didn't care. they suggested i buy another one and they would give me $3 off. i you plan on getting this dress you should totally get it from allegra.
265905	normally i were a small in dresses or between a 1 and 3 in juniors. i bought this in a size 4 because it was the smallest and it fits me great. i'm 5'0 and about 105pounds. it was perfect in length and the lace was actually very comfortable. only thing i didn't like about this dress was the way the slip in the neck line laid (not spaced enough like in picture) other than that it's great.
265952	good to replace the 25&#34; 12 pounder. this one is just a bit smaller 24&#34;, but much lighter. so should be able to pack in as much as before without having to heave it up into the car, etc.
266010	this is super cute. it is more on the small size the anything but, still super sexy. the gloves were adorable as well. this is a perfect little body suit for a sexy evening. if you are a dance it is very cute but, it is open crotch.
266079	i purchased this sweater in black in an xl. the sweater is very cute, the color is rich , the material is soft and appears to be of good quality. i normally wear a large in tops (i'm 5' 5&#34;, 150 lbs, 38 dd ) but. i'm glad i ordered an extra large in this sweater, as the style is fitted. it is perfect for work and for casual wear, i plan to wear it with slacks, leggings and jeans. the item looks just like it does online. i ordered the sweater on december 2nd and received it on december 12th, which is much earlier than expected as the seller said it would arrive until december 27th. i plan on ordering another color today!
266094	i've read the other reviews so i kinda knew what to expect: they are indeed big and heavy. heavier though than i expected. the thing that bothers me the most about them is that they make my earlobes look elongated and weighed down - and that's not a cool look in my books.otherwise, they are pretty, starting with the color and the way the facets sparkle.the stones on one of them are not centered...but hey...for 7 bucks ...it is what it is. glad i didn't pay more than that.
266149	i bought three pairs of these leggings. they fit ok but are a little short in the crouch area. i am 6'2&#34;, so pants are either long and short in the crouch or short and fit in the crouch. these are better than most, and i will wear them.
266185	i really like these shoes, color is so pretty they remind me of salmon color. feels a little big i wear 8 so these are a little bigger than most 8's but that's okay cause my feet seem to be bigger as the day goes on.  i love them they are very comfortable, they look good with the black leggings i'm wearing today.  got compliments on them this morning
266200	these flats are so cute.  however, after wearing them for one day, they rub the tops of my toes on each side (both shoes).  they are not too small, just something to do with the construction inside, on each side at the toe area.  i tried wearing trouser socks, but these flats don't look good with socks and socks look really silly with my crop pants and capris!! haha  seriously, i am disappointed as i have been shopping for quite a while for a comfortable shoe in this neutral color!  i hate writing a negative review and especially about clarks.  i primarily wear clarks shoes and this is the first time i have been disappointed.
266205	for plus sized draws, these don't cover much.  i wear a xl in the target boyshorts that are my everyday panties.  i got a 2x in these, and they did not come even half way up my backside.  let's not even get into what the front looked like.  not worth sending them back for the price, but a waste.  they are heavy quality and the bow is adorable, hence the two stars, but the sizing left a lot of coverage to be desired.
266211	they fit really good and the quality of these jeans are great they are not they flimsy materal alot of jeans are made of now a days. i will be buying more jeans from this seller really soon. this are very comfy jeans
266233	this bandeau bra is so comfortable, and looks so nice. i wear it under see-through shirts as well as a crop top with high waisted skirts. for the price, i was more than pleased with the product. definitely recommend!
266253	i really wanted to love this shoe, but i had to return them. i am envious of all the reviewers on here that raved about its comfort! yes, the insole was soft and cushy in the heel--but the toe box is impossibly narrow. i don't have &#34;wide feet,&#34; but the toe box of these shoes combined with the heel forces the wearer's big toe joint painfully inward. i understand that there's a balance and nobody wants shoes that look like boats, but ouch! a little consideration for normal human anatomy would have been appreciated, clarks.
266277	i love these tights.  i usually wear an xl and actually could have gotten by with a l, however, too much hassle to return and reorder so i kept.  if these had more cute colors other than just black, i would order more for yoga.
266291	i wear a lot of long skirts and needed some that would be a bit dressier, less aging hippie style. this skirt is a lovely navy blue, hangs nicely and can with the right shoes and blouse really look very flattering and dressy. i am pleased with it. it comes in a variety of colors, i may be tempted to get another color, or two....
266364	nice, practical sandal.  i wear them for work, they go with capris and pants.  my little toe does peek through the straps which is okay but not real attractive.  however, overall nice looking and comfortable.  they are keepers!
266502	i really like this sweater, it's true to the picture except the sleeves.  the sleeves are an akward length between three-quarter sleeves and full.  i really don't like ot, but other than that it's really cute.  the length is good, it's considerably thick for how inexpensive it is, and i will be wearing it lots.
266565	i have several pairs of orthoheel sandals, but these were the first purchased since vionic took over.  i ordered the same size as my others, but the foot bed did not align with my foot. to position my foot correctly with heel cup and arch support, it left a good inch at the toe.  very unattractive look.  returned these sandals.  was very disappointed- especially with the high price tag.
266642	normally, i wear a size 6 shoe size, but i fell in love with the look of these slippers, so i decided to try the smallest size (6.5 -7).  they fit great! there is arch support built into these slippers, making any long time wearing possible. the rubber soles allow me to run outside safely.
266658	a friend of mine had a pair similar to this so i tried hers on (8 1/2 - 9).  i wear an 8 1/2 shoe size. i could get my foot in the 8 1/2 - 9, but it was a little snug even with very thin socks on. so i bought the 9.5 to 10 size of the same shoe in this picture.  barefooted it is a little loose (i went a size up) but with a medium thickness pair of socks they are perfect.  if you are on the high-end of a size, i would recommend going a size up. i have worn them daily for about 2 weeks and have not noticed any stretching or other issues.  bottom line is they are soft, cushioney, and delightful on the foot; the inside sole of the foot is super cushioned (walking on a cloud) and warm.  you can also walk outside if you need to because they have a hard rubber sole. bought mine from kohl's. love them!
266682	this is a nice keen slide and the color is really nice - like paprika.  the fit was as expected.  good arch support.  i recommend.
266700	i had high hopes for these leggings, but was dissapointed upon their arrival.  the size fits a bit small (i wear a small), and the length was shorter than expected (i'm 5'8&#34;, these hit about 2 inches above my ankle).  definitely not opaque, you can see everything when you bend over.  returned these and will continue my search for the perfect, non see-through leggings.
266729	the collar might defeat the look if you don't like anything different. but i bought it because of the material and the collar. when i saw the blouse, i have to admit, i was a it disappointed. but decided to give it a shot & tried it on. my husband and my mom both like it. and when i look in the mirror, the first hing i noticed is the cute sleeves and the collar. plus it fits perfectly. i willwear it mondy to work and will probably wear it a lot... it just have it's own statement....cute
266732	i ordered a small when purchasing this item but once i got it i got a extra large! i was very disappointed, and when i went to ship it back the shipping rate was more then i paid for the item. this product is a hit and run because i have friends who ordered this also and got the desired size.
266774	if you're going for the off-the-shoulder look, it'll basically only be possible if you're a skinny person or slightly 'average' build, i don't know. everyone has a different shape, but i think the shoulder thing is possible if you're skinny and you order a large. so, since i'm not, the whole off-the-shoulder look is not possible. it kinda is, but it looks weird because the neck hole it's wide enough.there's nothing wrong with it, i'm just giving it 3 stars because it doesn't look good on me. lolpros: it's not extremely bad looking.cons: i don't like the colors in-person. i guess i tricked myself because the model makes it look good but, of course, she's a model.
266790	this shirt was amazing, i am a bigger chick and this shirt fits nice and i really love the way it feels and looks
266799	i get compliments on this all the time i wear with or without the tie. cute cute cute  will buy more this spring
266809	love this shirt. fit great and gets lots of compliments. shirts in this style are made to be big! i wear it with or without the belt. you aren't paying for cashmere so don't expect top quality.
266842	i have bought and tried many pairs of such shoes and had to return them all back to other companies, but these fit fantastic, very comfortable and look great too...
266890	i gave it to my sister, who is considerably smaller than i am. she seems happy. this really should not be listed under plus size dresses. i had no problem with the arm holes, nor with the neckline, but i had expected a slightly looser fit in the underskirt.
266912	i would recommend, even though i bought a medium, when i should have actually bought a small so it fits a bit loose on me but no complains here.the sweater is very comfortable and the material is really soft and not harsh on my skin at all.
266913	beware, i ordered and returned this twice!i loved the look and feel of this sweater, but the first one i received had a stain and a snag across the bottom. i sent it back and the neck one had a hold in the arm pit clearly this sweater is just made poorly =-(
266940	this is the third dress i have purchased from lindy bop.  overall, their dresses are quality and this dress is quite lovely.  the fit is exactly as i expected, using their size chart, and the material has just a touch of stretch to hug the upper body.  i love the buttons that run just below the bust line, very nice touch.  this is a very classy looking dress.  i look forward to wearing it!
266941	thanks so  much the dress makes me feel like a beautiful classy women we had a mix up you fixed paid for the return thank you your styles are not of america they have class and style im from germany born i love usa but your style is beautiful thank you will purshase again  thank you
266952	the earrings are lovely but extremely hard to open & close. i most like the size, not too big nor not too small. it's a pity that such little craftsmanship was applied to the clasp.
266968	these leggings are grreeaaatttt!!!great quality for such a bargain!!the color and detail of the print on these leggings are so intricate, i can't believe how inexpensive it is!the package arrived in less time indicated, which is always a huge plus!!!i will definitely buy from this seller again!!
266972	i loooooove the way these fit and feel! they are gorgeous! they are silky and smooth, like a second skin. not too thin. the waist comes up nicely so you won't have to worry about them sliding down. the print on them is very nice! i can't wait to wear them! they really accentuate my figure! these are hot! i only rated them 4 stars because i haven't washed them yet, and i don't know how they will behave. but for now, i am pleasantly pleased!!!
266994	i knew i shouldn't expect much for the cheap price.  i was surprised to learn the two colors are actually different shirt materials sewn together.  i assumed the whole cat design was screen-printed.  it wouldn't be that big of an issue, but the tan kitty shape is sewn on top of the black with a half inch exposed edge all around.  this means the very tips of the kitty's ears flop over.  it looks sloppy.  the tan fabric itself seems a lot thinner and less soft than the black.  also the hem along the bottom is kind of wonky, making it curl up a little.  i do love the batwing arm shape though.i purchased a large and usually wear a medium.  i'd say this was the right size choice.  the shirt really doesn't look like it does on the model though.  i'd say less girly cute and more potato sack.  maybe it'll grow on me with the right accessories.
267072	long and bright. i felt like the great pumpkin. it is a pictured just not on me. my fault the product came as shown.
267082	looks good casual or dressed up.  seams are good.  length is good for me, i'm 5'8&#34;.  good for layering.  i'm pleased.
267097	the top is great! the little belt has no way of staying on. there are no belt loops. i wore the top straight down which also looks really god. almost a dress look. so there you go up or down looks and feels great:)
267099	this was very smooth and mature! my mother wanted this and i am glad i ordered it in a larger size, otherwise it would have been way too small for her.
267152	i probably have close to 20 allegra k shirts now, and i love every single one of them.  yes, they tend to run a little small, but as long as you take the reviews into consideration and utilize the size chart, you should be able to find the size that works best for you.  personally, i'm 5'2, about 140 lbs, and big busted (36dd)...i'm usually a l - xl in 'juniors' tops.  this one in particular i bought in a large and it fits perfectly.
267161	i bought it as a gift for my sister and she loved it a lot, the fabric and colour are as picture :)
267183	i don't know why people are complaining about this shirt because i really like it! it is very thin and definitely needs a tank or camisole under it, but i expected that.  it is super comfortable and the fit is just as i expected it to be.  i will order more of these shirts!
267229	the pattern is bright and colorful. the fabric is very sheer but the description says sheer. i wear camis under almost everything these days and this will be perfect for the hot phoenix summer. some of you will not feel the need for an undershirt. it is not transparent. the fit was as expected. i read the size chart and ordered appropriately. some of you have complained that the batwing description does not apply. a batwing has nothing to do with the length of the sleeve. it is used to describe when the front is attached to the back and the sleeve is all part of the body. there is not the extra seams for an attached sleeve. if you want a large drape, buy a size up. i have been on a weight loss journey and do not want to spend a lot of money. but i still like pretty clothes. i have already ordered more form this company. for the ,money, it is ideal for my situation.
267274	this is exactly what it looks like - a vest that is open, with a flowy, breezy, open front.  it's a nice texture, sort of natural-feeling.  the color saturation is great and it looks really nice with dresses and tops.  i definitely like it for classing up some of my more outlandish clothing for work.i'd definitely recommend this as a great option if you don't feel quite up to making one of your own out of a tee-shirt.
267356	"this robe is super comfortable! i'm a bigger girl who's about to get married, and i bought this to wear while i get ready before my dress goes on. i didn't want to be running around in my underwear and shapewear with the photographers and stylists there, so this is my solution. it's casual, light, and breathable. length is also true to size--i'm 5'6"" and it comes down to my knees. the tie is actually sewn onto the robe in the back, so it doesn't shift or get lost, which is also a plus."
267519	im a size 4-6 and i ordered a large due to where product was made, it runs very small.  the sizing chart is incorrect on the measurements and its not a standard fit.  do not recommend this item to others.  pay a little more and get a better quality item with more positive write ups.
267535	"my grandma always called them shoe spoons, not shoehorns.  so a tip o' the hat to you, grandma.coincidentally, grandma was crippled (her word, not mine) after a stroke in her early 40s.  she would have done well with a shoe spoon like this one.  (parenthetically, although she was crippled, she was far from disabled.  she wouldn't hesitate to hobble out back with her cane, reach down and take one of her hens by its neck, and give it a quick swing over her head to ""ready it"" for dinner.  she was a beautiful and tough old grandma, and never seemed disabled to me.)this is a great product.  it has a sturdy looped handle that makes it easy to grip and simple to hang on a peg.  the plastic is thick and sturdy.  it might be a little thick at the end and not leave enough room if the shoes are too tight, but hopefully the savvy shopper will leave a little wiggle room in his or her shoes.this is a thoughtfully constructed product.  the length and durability make it very reliable and ensure that it will accomplish its task without breaking.  and at this size, i dare you to lose it.grandma would have loved this shoe spoon, but her middle aged grandson appreciates it too.i was provided this item for review."
267540	"in order to keep down the dirt in the carpeted part of our home, we remove our shoes when we come into our house, and we ask our guests to do the same. we've always used shoehorns: they keep the backs of shoes in good shape for years. but the reason for this shoehorn is that it's convenient when we or guests are leaving. at 24 inches, it's easy for anyone to put on their shoes without having to bend. even our grandkids use it, and having once been a kid, that's just weird. btw, this isn't flimsy: it's ""solid"" (and with a handle) and won't bend when putting on shoes or half-boots.if you live ""back east,"" i'd definitely recommend one (or two) of these in your mud room or foyer.[shoehorn provided by the manufacturer.]"
267591	i give these shoes 2 stars for the style..  i was looking forward to purchasing these shoes in black./ unfortunately, on closer view showed the stitching is white and appears to be so with all the colors!  how tacky and cheap, otherwise i'd go for it.
267592	"these shoes fit just as expected.  i wear a 7.5 either m or w in most clarks shoes (depending upon style).  i ordered a 7.5 w in these, and they are a smidge wide; however, i often have swollen feet so the extra width accommodates the plump feet without being constrictive.  the heel is a good height, and the navy is a true color. another reviewer (another site, same shoe) mentioned that the strap was mostly for appearance and did not allow for adjustment.  that is not the case for me.  the strap is indeed adjustable and allows me a bit of flexibility.  i have a narrow heel, and there is a bit of slippage there; however, it is not enough to be uncomfortable or irritating to the foot.  the insole is cushy, and there is a decent arch support.  i bought these to go with my ""funeral dress"" [others....not mine ;)], and they will be perfect for those occasions.  the amazon description is accurate.  i consider them a bit matronly looking; however, others have mentioned wearing them with jeans etc. which indicates to me that this style may be appealing to a rather extended age group."
267648	this dress is not flattering at all. you can't tell from the picture but it basically billows out around your wait. it made it look like my stomach is even bigger than it is! the print is cute but the style is just not flattering on me at all.
267653	ive been wearing this scarf practically every day since i got it. it is comfortable and lightweight and the fabric and hearts arent cheap. its a nice spring or fall scarf definitely wont keep you warm as a winter scarf.
267696	i'm size medium but requested the large since i like to wear loose clothes. very comfortable and great for summer.
267798	these sweatshirts are absolutely wonderful.  a wide-range of colors.  a nice weight that isn't flimsy nor too heavy.  washes well and lasts forever.any time i am looking for a plain sweatshirt (no hood and no zipper) these are the ones i buy.
267803	they work nice for a second hole, but feel a bit cheep which is to be exepected from the price. the green ones came with the stone fallen out but i didn't care much as green isn't really my color. over all for the price i'm glad i got them.
267815	this skirt runs small.beautiful colors that goes good with orange denim white or just about any color combination.  i am 5' 10 &#34; tall 190 lbs normally i wear a large. in this case i should have ordered  x large. i kept the skirt but next time i will know to order the bigger size..
267839	the size small fits an 35-26-25 hourglass 110 lb. 5'5&#34; figure well.  very pleased with this purchase for spring.  i wish it had been less wrinkled in the delivery.
267873	love the material, adore the print, size true to uh, size.. i can wear it as a dress (i'm 5 ft short) so it's a bit long. so is everything, so i won't take away a star for that. have and will order more from this company. the picture does it justice. moves great, feels great.
267921	i love these shoes.  they are really comfortable even when walking or standing a lot.  they are very cute too.
267953	i like the boot itself. it was a little hard to put on and my foot felt snug, but not bad. the problem is that the soles of the shoes are rubber. so when i walked on them, the heels just kind of smooshed down. unfortunately and super hard to walk in. too bad. they are cute.
267965	i use this for making my own liposomal vitamin c.  i compared this model to an isonic ultrasonic cleaner model d3800a, and i found this one to be much better for making vitamin c.  it has an 8 minute timer, which is perfect for making the vitamin c.  it's also very easy to pour the solution out of the removable container into a storage container or glass jar.  that was a deal breaker for me.  most liposomal vitamin c reciepes call for a total of 3 cups of water (or 16oz), which works great since this holds 17oz.
267969	i had to return the cleaner because it stopped working.  it cleaned beautifully, looked great and i was very pleased with my purchase.  then it stopped working.
268002	recently found out i could not wear size 6 anymore it would fall off. so went to stores that had 5.5 shoe sizes and those were perfect fits but unfortunately cannot find 5.5 sizes in stores so i had to try amazon and found this pair of flat shoes and ordered. i was kind of skeptical if they would fit me or not. when they arrived i tried them on and they were a perfect fit. just love them.
268059	yes, this dress will need ironing upon arrival...i don't think any amount of packaging would change that, it's the nature of the material and worth every bit of time it takes! the color is a lighter gold, i would call it champagne and would advise looking for accessories in that hue if ordering them online. i wore a 26&#34; petticoat with this and let a half inch of the ruffle show and loved the look. at 5'2&#34; and a size that varies from a 2-4, i ordered the small and had a perfect fit.
268080	i loved it at first but it makes my finger turn green after a while not happy such a shame as it is so pretty but can't wear it no more
268213	i bought this after buy another very similar. the first that i ordered was pretty an very similar of the picture. the second one was very bad finished. it was terrible.
268219	i bought two in different colors. the green one arrived looking like it had been dragged on the floor and had a red stain on the back. i am returning it, but with shipping, will probably end up losing money. the clean one that i kept fits well, but the pads in the cup are awkward and have to be adjusted every time i put it on.
268225	i seen on the reviews that these ran small. then someone said they ran big. so i decided to just go ahead and order my normal tank top size. well, it's sort of snug in the chest area. shows every bulge or roll. then starts to get larger the rest of the way down. they are a bit long. almost like a triangle form. if that makes any sense. it wouldn't really do me any good to go larger because then your talking wider arm pit area. and over all probably not a good look at all. there's no give at all in the material.nor flow. now on a positive note. they cost me a small fortune for a slight disappointment. and the colors are gorgeous. so if you are a curvy gal. i would either size up and take a chance they work for you. or just find a different style all together. i like stretch and flow in my tops. especially in the summer. fashion and comfort are the key ingredients for looking and feeling good :)
268231	i really like this tank top, it doesn't fit tight and is very comfortable, and the color is spot on. i needed something a little bigger for my workouts, i can't stand tanks that ride up my belly, and this definitely won't do that. it's great, 5 stars for me.
268270	runs small and doesn't really come off shoulder which is kind of a bummer but i make just stretch it out lol.nice material and good color options.def worth the price just order 1 size bigger :)
268296	i am in love with this braclet, i cant wait till spring/summer to wear them! very well put together and sturdy too
268324	overall i like this dress.  the design is very figure flattering! however, the back zipper seems to be a bit too long for the dress and thus &#34;puckers&#34; up.  overall, very satisfied!
268376	i bought this thinking i would be rocking it in the club but instead my sister was the one rocking it. the fit on me was too large but on my sister it looked beautiful, the material is very good and the fit on her was great. she is a very pleased camper since i bought it for her literally :)
268434	first, they are really thin so it's hard to get your fingertips into the tips of the clothes so you can use your phone-which is the reason i bought these. second, the button fell off in less than a week. i didn't even unbutton them, it just simply fell off one day. i am more annoyed by this because had i knew this would happen i would have redid the stitching myself.
268439	very disappointed.  it is smaller than some large shirts i have.  i bought it roomy because it is for a xmas party with an ugly shirt.  it's stretchy material but i must admit i was not expecting it to be this small.  it's a man's shirt too.  i would not recommend nor buy this shirt ever again.
268459	the black bag has a few hints of pink to it that i did not pick up on when viewing the photo. the seams have a pink line to them - very subtle, but nicely done. the straps are a bit flimsier than i expected, but it should still hold up for many uses. the straps are not adjustable. the inside is fully lined with a nice silk-like fabric. i wish it was just a tad bit larger, but am using it for errands and a tablet i carry and it is serving it's purpose.
268507	i wanted to buy this coat while i lived in london awhile back, but never got the chance.i'm so happy i was able to find it on the us amazon.now let me warn people: the uk to us sizes are a bit off here, but that shouldn't discourage you. a size 14 uk is more on the lines of a size 12 us. a size 12 uk is a size 10 us (i know because i'm a size 12 uk and all my close i bought in london are a size 12uk).with that being said. i love the feel of this coat. the fleece is really nice and soft and has you looking stylish. is great for fall and spring weather. maybe a little winter weather, as long is it doesn't get too cold (which is why this was perfect for london weather). i moved back to new england, which is a bit like english weather (a little more extreme, so this coat was a must have, even here.) i look forward to heading back to my second home, england in the future. i'm really tempted to buy this jack in a couple of colors.
268545	i wear a 9 1/2 and ordered a 10 and it fits perfect. this is the same shoe as really sexi with no glitter that i wear a size 9.
268622	i love geneva brand watches; i have almost every color; the watches are cheap in price but has excellent quality and can be coordinated with every outfit; i would wholeheartedly recommend geneva brand watches to anyone.
268626	my grandson received this for christmas and loved it. he wore it once and the connecting rings broke so, unfortunately, he has not been able to wear it again. i requested a return label to send it back and get a new one and have gotten no response.
268699	i am so pleased with this blouse that i just ordered two more from sakkas.  i am xl/12, 36dd bust. 5'10&#34;.  this one-size shirt is awesome for my post baby belly.  it is cute and quirky and there is plenty of beautiful fabric, sequins, embroidery and colors to draw the eye away from my tummy.  i was worried it would be too short for me, i have a long torso, but it was just perfect.  i do need to wear a tank underneath- it may be a little low cut in the arm holes for thinner/shorter women.
268709	first off, i want to say that i love sakkas clothing line...so inexpensive for their fabulous look and fit, that i am willing to deal with the fragile nature of their hand-died items.  the con's: that means you must be willing to hand wash gently in cold water and hang/re-shape to dry.  their clothes (being mostly cotton blends) will bleed when you wash them.  so theirs are not 'toss in the wash' pieces of clothing!  the pro's: gorgeous colors, embroidery, details...and for many pieces (like these tops here)- a fabulous fit.  they also ship fast and handle returns promptly.  i recommend!
268712	this one is a 'one-size' top, which does fit ok. it is very beautiful, a type i love. but the sleeveless part is not complimentary to me as i'm a plus size. but i'll wear it anyway as i think it in itself is very pretty and flows nicely from the top. it would look terrific on someone smaller, but i love tie-dye and sequins.
268726	the dress perfectly and i am a size 14. the colors look exact. the feel of the dress is wonderful you will want to wear it to bed!
268730	i'm a flower child so i still dress like a hippie, very satisfied with dress, the stitching for the moons and decorations shine in the daylight which is beautiful.
268750	this blouse is nice looking, however when i got it, it had a terrible smell, and it also stains when washed, so it must be handwashed. overall, disappointing. i guess that's what you get for the cheap price.
268757	this ring is beautiful. when i took it out of the packaging (which could have been better) i was actually surprised at how shiny it was and how much sparkle there was. personally, i can tell the center stone is not real, it is not completely obvious, but when looking hard at it, i can tell. however, the side stones and band, i would think is all real. the size of the stones are nice and pretty, nothing too big. ring size is pretty good, i am normally a 6.5 which is what i ordered but it feels like a 6.75 which is not bad. i like having some room so, it is a nice fit. i was really happy to see &#34;18krgp&#34; on the inside of the band. this means, it should hold up pretty well for awhile. guess we shall see. with all the being said, for the price&#8230;you really cannot beat it. it's really pretty and if i were to lose it or if it got scratch, i would purchase another one.
268845	i wasn't sure it would fit because i wear a 1x or 2x but it fit perfectly because it's very roomy.  brilliant color, soft material.
268861	it is a pretty pendant.  it was a little smaller than i expected, but i gave it as a gift and the receiver seemed pleased.
268862	i really like the stone!!! so pretty!!! seems that the stone is set well i have had it on for months and i never take it off.
268887	i bought the natalie wash. and they fit perfect. i bought the same size i've been buying right along in these jeans. unless someone states they run small or big. if someone says they fit true to size, that means just that. these are real nice. they don't give you the muffin top. or make me feel like i'm squeezing my butt into them. and believe me, i'm a curvy women. they seem to fit nicely in all the right area. not tight at all. i am finding, however, if i focus on the &#34;curvy&#34; style, they seem to fit better. seeing's how i have the hips and thighs going on. it seems nice i can wear stylish jeans and feel good in them and not feel discouraged because of my shape. this brand has become my favorite. with the help of fellow reviewers of course :) thanks guys :) i'm 5'2&#34;-125 lbs.with an athletic build along with the hips and thighs being a bit on the heavier side. and the size 7 fit me perfect with breathing room :) i'm hoping that the other wash of these jeans fit the same. that's my next purchase.
268938	i had to have jeans for work ad in a hurry.  the size is way off so i ordered another bigger size, the next size up, way too big.  the material is very poor quality and has begun to fray upon first washing.
268947	these are the first pair of jeggings i've bought and i'm super happy that i got these. really good quality and amazing fit! i'm 5' 8&#34; with long legs and i was concerned that these would not be long enough but they are the perfect length. gotta get another pair!
268987	these were a gift for my daughter and she loves them, vionic with orthaheel womens yaris thong sandals 7 m black patent
269009	i get lots of compliments daily. i wear these for work and im on my feet for 10+ hours a day as a massage therapist. super comfy and quiet
269085	i love these slipper boots!! they fit great and are very warm! i wanted a pair of slipper boots to wear with my skinny legged yoga pants and these were everything i was hoping for. both my sisters wanted a pair when they saw mine. i've had these for a while now and with a lot of  use, they are holding up great. they fit true to size.
269094	this is a surprisingly above average quality plastic spiderman mask. it feels great to the touch, well made, colors are good, and its nicely detailed and comfortable. the mask features a pair of embedded laser lights. the point is you throw the little discs like frisbees and the laser catches the light and it looks cool. this is an okay concept but we don't really use them much. the mask alone is worth the price. i have seen other versions of this mask in the stores and its not the same, its nicer.
269133	i'm a very skinny person and it's hard to find pants that don't fall down. these are perfect! the color is awesome! when i first got them, i was irritated that the button hole wasn't cut. the hole was sewed for the button hole, but the fabric was still solid. then i found out that some company's sell pants this way as proof of newness. all i had to do was slit the fabric and bam! perfect! :)
269137	i would recommend this ring as well as all their jewelry for the quality of what they offer at a price that allows it to be purchased. the beaded chain was a nice surprise gift which i also put to use immediately putting my blessed mother mary pendant on it.thank you konov
269183	the puma shoes voltaic 5 is very ggod. comfortable, the colour es fine. the finished is very good. i recomended.
269191	this is really a pretty dress. colors true to picture. i am a 2 plus and can wear some of sakka's dresses easily...not with this one.  im sending it back. too bad since it really is very pretty. lovely colors. i think it runs small. so if you are in plus sizes period..think twice before you buy. sakka's needs to add plus sizes to their inventory.
269239	for the price it's hard to knock them. they fit nicely and don't seem to ride down my waist like some--as a big girl it can hard to find the right jeans. for ordering a pair off the internet i'm very happy with them. the only caveat is that the ankles are a bit big--not really skinny jeans in this way. you can't really wear them with boots and have them look right--i wear them with sneakers or some other low top shoe and they look great.
269273	i normally wear levis.  i ordered the same size in these jeans and they fit perfectly!  great price, great fit.
269311	purchased this sweater for an ugly christmas sweater party. then i hand sewed red tinsel around the bottom, collar and sleeve cuffs. it looked great! i ordered a large because i wanted an oversized look to wear with skinny jeans and boots. another reviewer stated the sweater was thin and itchy, but i found it to be very soft and comfortable. the sweater was just the right thickness for me to be at a crowded party and not get hot; it is not thin or see through.
269385	it is so pretty and the price is not expensive, it is good gift for the friends , they will love it
269449	this sweater is of very high quality. it is nicely made and is unexpectedly warm. the material is super soft and almost feels like being wrapped in a fleece robe.
269477	if you want these shirts order maybe 2 sizes bigger. my 8 year old could not wear a adult small. the seller wanted me to pay shipping for what needed to be mentioned in the verbage about the shirt.
269549	these are very cute, comfortable boots!  excellent price.  wore them black friday shopping and received several compliments on them.  just ordered a pair in brown and would have ordered black but they were all out of my size.  highly recommend these boots!
269576	this shirt fit well. i do wish the bottom was just a tad shorter. it is body hugging so i did order a size up. great for layering or just wearing alone.
269584	"i looks exactly like the photo, it wears very snug to the frame which i love... well, maybe not at the armpits ahaha. i'm not saying they're a problem, i only mean my adrenaline pumps a lot so i'd rather have lack of contact there. but the shirt is beautiful, the color (mocha) is beautiful, and the length is very ""excite your man (or woman) if you like to walk around pants free but with a longish shirt on. it looks great. i'm gonna buy it in every color i can get my dollars on.oh, and if you don't want it too fitted to you, go a size up.update: i washed it, make sure you do tumble low heat dry. it shrank, but not very much. and it'll ease back into its fit once worn i'm sure.and i got one in peach, a size medium, and it came to me with a hole in the arm! can you believe it?! the shirt is still amazing, but i'll have to sew that sleeve, not cool."
269636	more like crappy.... these just fit weird....the upper panel is huge, almost maternity huge, and yet they somehow are too short to even cover my ankles (or uggs). i wouldn't wear them out of the house, though i'm not sure they'll last long enough to navigate my stairs for a week.
269653	"i am 108lbs and almost 5'5"" and these shorts are rather tight on me. i have a very small bottom and hips, so if you normally wear a medium i don't believe these will work. i recommend these for xsmall women only (size 0-2). they are a good quality though. i will wear these under short dresses for modesty."
269662	these are beautiful earrings, but they are very small, nowhere near the size of the picture on the product pate.  the width of each one is 37 hundreths of an inch and the length is 42 hundredths of an inch.  pretty small...in fact tiny.  this indicates to me that these are for a modest and possibly older lady.the color .of the stones is dark.  they have to be angled just right to bring out any brighter color.  the illustration show them reflecting more of a reddish color than they actually do.they would look nice on the ears of a conservative and maybe older woman, but they just aren't eye catching.  i don't think they're worth the $44 list price, but amazon's $26 price seems right.so over all, i believe a woman in my apartment complex for age 62+ would be very pleased with these, but wouldn't really recommend them for a younger modern woman due to their small size and due to their being pleasant to the eye, but not, as i've previously said, eye catching.
269759	can yo tell i love this dress? i love the fit, fabric and structure of this dress. i hope there are more designes and sizes will become available. this dress is great for trave as it is weightless and needs no ironing. it hugs my curls in a great way and the patterns conceals my core area. this may be the find of the year for me. thank you seller! ladies, you'll want to buy this dress for your year round wardrobe.
269797	"it is hard to find a high impact sports bra that is truly high impact. if you have large breasts, it doesn't seem to matter how much of a label a manufacturer slaps on it, when you have to hold onto your bazoombas to keep them from flipping and flopping about while running, it just plain sucks. nothing makes me madder than a bra labeled for running, that lets my girls fly free. unfortunately that happens a lot, in every price range.i like an underwire, and i like a closure, and this style has both. i simply cannot drag a fastener-less bra over my head and manhandle my breasts into them without getting really annoyed or popping stitching on the bra. i really don't even care for front-fastener bras that much because it's so much effort to bring my boobs together to fasten the cups, and a front fastener really still lets them bobble.there are two ways traditionally used to determine your bra size. i've worked at fitting bras before so i know how to determine my size, and i use the typical method: measure your rib cage just under your breasts; if it's an odd number add one. now measure around the fullest part of your breasts, and subtract the rib cage measurement from your full breast measurement. each 1"" difference is a cup size: 1"" a cup, 2"" b cup, 3"" c cup, 4"" d cup, etc. this always works for me regardless of where i shop for a bra, and i refuse to let any saleswoman do the ""measure your rib cage and add 4"", this is your band size"" method. sure, if i wanted my boobs to hang out of the cups like fallen udders, i'd do that thanks.  with this in mind i ordered a 38c in this yvette bra because that's what i wear. however, the band was just under 29"" and fit like a 34/36. it was like a tourniquet, not a bra. the company rep i spoke to sent me a 42c, and it fit.  so with this in mind, use the method that a saleswoman in a $60 bra store would use: add 4"" to your band measurement and go from there.my favorite part about this bra is the extra piece attached over the cups. it helps hold down any stray boobage, and really keeps your cups from running over with extra. i like that it helps add a little modesty too, i don't want cleavage when i'm trying to exercise. this bra stays put while running, walking, doing my tapout workouts, and on my fitness pole. for a bra to stay in place while i reach wayyyyyyyyy over my head to stretch? got my vote.  the wide cushioned straps also keep the straps from digging into your shoulders---very nice.nice, soft fabric and very well constructed. it feels heavier than bras i've paid a lot more for. sometimes i run several miles at a time and get very sweaty but this bra always feels dry when i take it off.update: i rotate this bra into use heavily, as soon as it's dry it's one of the first bras i grab. i have enough bras to work out every day for a week and then it's time to wash another batch. i use the delicate cycle in a front-load washer, if i had a top loader i would not use it. i would hand wash the bra. i hang dry all my bras and workout clothes. but it's been months of weekly washing, this bra still looks as new as it did from day one. it still supports as well as it always has. in fact i've lost weight and no longer fill it up like i used to, but it's so adjustable that it still fits me with heavy duty support. no stretching out of the fabric. these bras are a great value! i have other bras that cost more, that haven't held up as well as this one."
269898	this is a cute butterfly necklace for a young girl. it is a good value for the price. i've seen similar items in stores for a lot more money.
269913	i saw these on hsn or qvc and heard the testimonials.  decided to see if amzn had them.  of course they did!i broke my right ankle 16 months ago and even tho it is supposedly healed, i have lots of swelling, pain, etc in the ankle and one of my hips especially in all this winter weather.  probably the new way i walk - favoring that sore ankle.when i put these on for the first time, i thought the right arch of the shoe was misshapen or something was stuck under my foot.  not so.  that was how far out of alignment my foot, ankle and leg had become and this sandal forced all that to straighten up.  no more pronation.  these things really work.  they were totally comfortable within an hour of first use.so glad the weather will warm up soon b/c i want to wear these as much as possible.  meanwhile, i'll wear them around the house all day (i'm retired) when i'm home.  bet that swelling stops and maybe even the hip pain:).  the reason for four stars is the fit.  i normally wear a 9.5n.  i bought these in 9m b/c they don't come in half sizes or narrows.  the length is perfect with a little extra shoe at both ends.  but a person with narrow feet will find these too wide to walk in easily (as is the case with many flip-flops).  so, i got an old pair of low cut socks and cut the material between the big toe and other toes.  it pads the shoe enough to enable walking.  and, no, i'm not wearing these outside like that!!
270023	small in the arm area. not comfortable because of that and so i sent it back. was disappointed because of that.
270054	i have been looking for boots in the style that are affordable, and these are perfect!the fit was good. i always order half a size up in boots to make sure i can wear socks with them. as well, they are very comfortable. even laced up, they did not rub against my bare ankles.they are not super-high-quality, but it is still a deal for the price. the fold down top is really cute and has snaps to keep in place. the boots also look cute not rolled down and have an edgier feel. i've worn them both ways, with both skinny jeans and skirts.the only pain is having to unlace them to take them off. my friend has a similar style with a hidden zipper. that would be ideal!
270119	the blouse is ok, nice to have
270148	i'm 5.3&#34;tall and 120 pounds heavy and the size small fits me very well. i just got it, so not sure it's going to have lints over time, but i like it for the price and it's very stretchy as well. the neckline doesn't come down like the one in the picture but i prefer that way since it's for winter.
270157	these gloves are great. very comfortable, snug and warm. there are only 2 very minor things, more so inconveniences, that i will note on so that people are aware. first, the way they decided to hold the fold-over mitten is just a small piece of the same fabric the glove is made out of. it is very small, and it feels like it could easily be ripped or mangled. it takes precision accuracy to fit the tie that holds it all together through the hole. secondly, it's actually kind of difficult to take the gloves off without having to do each finger individually. i said it was minor, but it takes an extra bit of time to get them off. overall though, excellent gloves and they do a great job keeping my hands warm.
270162	another reviewer said this and i didn't read enough reviews before purchasing apparently, but the thumbs are not fully covered! deal breaker for me. although the rest of the design is nice i will be returning. not worth losing my thumbs!
270170	do not buy this top you will look very misshaped.  the back on it is wide open.  its continues to get wider all the way down from the shoulders.  i was really disappointed.
270183	i like this top. i'm not overly crazy about it, but it's nice. it is sheer in the back, but it's black so it covers enough. the arms are long enough and i will wear the top. the top is t-shirt material and even with the sheer chiffon underneath, it is thin. certainly not as thin as some t-shirts today though. so again i like the top. perhaps it would look really good in a print! yes, i think it would look more lovely if available in a print.
270219	i was concerned with this item with all of the back and forth reviews. i'm must say the only thing that is absolutely true is that this item runs small. i am a size 4 and ordered a large. i guessed correctly on the size. however, it's a little tight on the top. i have broad shoulders and i'm an a cup. it's also extremely large in the crouch/ butt area. its more of the fact that my torso isn't long enough for the swim suit. i'm 5' 3. i guess i better look for another swim suit.
270273	its pretty for what it is, but it is very, very cheap. hard to wear with comfort. i would recommend it for halloween and goths who don't mind having to adjust their bracelet a million times a day.
270282	it arrived early and is fun and very pretty to wear. i enjoy it very much! compliments pour in when i wear it.
270325	the knit fabric and print are beautiful. the quality is good. the top fits well, but the bottoms are a little big. it's a good thing i like roomy pj's.
270344	i see under the description, it says made in us &#34;or imported&#34;.  product made in china, so who knows what it is made out of.the bag stinks...as in smells, ...the inside of bag is so cheaply made...stitching is coming apart , you can see where there looks like there as a hole already, and it was stitched back up.  i stopped buying any junk from china a few years ago and totally missed the &#34;or imported&#34;.  this is not like any leather i've seen, so again, can imagine what it is.  it sure looks cute, but already back in box to return. and even at &#34;only 30 bucks&#34;, ...no,this is an ocean state job lot quality item.
270374	these are perfect for my growing baby. i keep him in these pajamas because at home they are super easy for changing diapers. they also have the great option to cover the hands with a built in flap if you want! it's great if my baby is cold or has sharp nails that i can't get to until he's calm or asleep. the colors are simple which i love! i recommend these.
270419	this skirt has no give at all. which would be fine. except there is no zipper or anything.  the pattern is not fabric but rather a print... it has somewhat of a rubbery texture.
270487	this is a great skirt. i wish it came in x-large.  i was able to fit the large but if you are a little thick you need to go a size up.  it was really cute on me but a little snug if you have butt!. i gave 2 skirts and the jacket to a friend, it was too cute to send back.  j.tomson made a great skirt, vest, and jacket but some of us need a little bit more material:) i give this 4 1/2 stars.
270510	i really like the detail in this watch.  the crystals are small, so they are not too much, but still illicit a nice shine and polished look.  the watch is a nice fit (i have an average sized wrist).  the face is a conservative size, but can still be easily read. overall, this is a beautiful piece for a woman of any age.  i love it!
270566	first time jockey buyer, but i am quite satisfied with the quality of the cotton and nice fit.  will reorder more soon!
270567	i recently ordered the elegance brief in style 1444 in a size 9 and they fit comfortably.  a little on the small side, but comfortable.  only i couldn't find this style in solid black in my size so i searched amazon and found this style in black in a size 9.  this is style # 1484.  both of these styles claim to be plus sized.however, this style in a size 9 black feels more like a size 8 or even a size 7 compared to typical size 9's i buy, including jockey.  they are extremely tight and uncomfortable.  uncomfortable because the leg opening is so wide so they ride up more than i want them to. and the waistband feels too tight.  i haven't washed them yet, so i can expect they will shrink even more.  the material feels the same as the other style.  but in general, the quality of these jockey underwear are not what they used to be.  the material feels much thinner.i'm really disappointed in this purchase.  moreover, they were 6.50 more than the other style!!!!  waste of my money, but i paid more because i wanted them in black.  now i would have to buy them in a bigger size if i still want black and toss these out.disappointed.  i feel cheated.
270577	i really like these briefs, the colors are great, black, also dark and light heather.  they are so comfortable, you don't know you have them on.
270601	i bought this to use during the warmer spring and fall days when a heavier sweater would be too much. good neutral color which can go with anything. looking forward to using it come april and may.
270617	these are sweet!  if you're looking for top quality, these aren't for you. if you just want a cute pair ok kicks-these will do. i'd not wear them on a day at an amusement park, but good for day to day. i actually got one pair in black and one in the beige.
270662	these are cute.  they are obviously cheaply made, which i expected.. won't last long but i do like them. it should also be noted the the black necklace isn't like the photo.. it's actually exactly like the blue one, triangular.  which is fine... just fyi.
270706	really loved the blue one had the leaf one already and gave it to a friend.  she noted how she liked the leaf one that i was wearing so i figured i would give her the spare one.  very great price, very great gift, very durable
270725	i bought these for my teenage daughter for whom nothing seems to be good enough.  she loves them!  she especially likes the material that they are made of -- kinda silky feeling.  the cut is great; not real teeny or slinky. very comfortable.
270739	omg! love love love these shoes!! i need more colors of them.these shoes works for every occasion. from a wedding to a cookout. compliments and attention in every wear. when i opened the box i was stunned. they look as good as the pic. fits the contour of my feet. extra light and comfy like i imagine heaven is. so far go with every outfit i've worn. narrow feet women if you are looking for this style of shoe for the summer and you like them, order them. they fit narrow feet fine. i bought them in medium. you can not go wrong. i can wear and dance in them for hours. thanks again amazon for another shoe i'm happy with.
270747	warm, comfortable -- i sleep in them and you can even get away with a trip to the corner store. bought a pair for my husband as well.
270783	now that the weather is cold, the ring guard falls off every time i remove the ring from my finger.  i've checked to be sure it's applied properly, but it just won't stay on.  it is very narrow and that's all i needed b/c the ring fit fine in warm weather and just needed a little slack taken up in the winter.  don't know the solution.
270786	these ring guards i bought but haven't used any because they are for real tiny rings, that are a lot more narrow then small or average size width rings. that is why i only gave it three stars, but someday i may need them!
270836	i love these earrings. just the right size and they sparkle. i got them for $20 on a lightening deal....so i ordered one of each thinking i would return any i didn't like. i'm keeping them all. they are beautiful! buy them....even at a higher price!
270962	i read several reviews prior to ordering these pj bottoms, most stated they ran small, i'm 5'2 and 110 and based on a similar review with my approx size and weight the person said order up, so i ordered a medium instead of a x-small or small. my delivery arrived yesterday, i was excited, but when i opened the package and removed them they appeared huge, i still had to try then on, i was majorly disappointed, i could have fit two of me in them they were so huge!!maybe, mine were missed marked but i highly doubt it, order your normal size to start if they are to small exchange.reviews can be helpful but i've noticed with clothes there misleading?????
270963	i love these pants!!!  i wasn't expecting much for the price, so i was so pleased to find that they are perfect.  it's rare to find pj pants that are actually long!  i'm 5'6 and they don't ride up around my ankles at all.  they are thin and soft so they're perfect for most every season.  and the cute steve madden waist band adds a nice touch as well.  would definitely urge people to buy them unless you're on the short side and don't like too much material dragging around your feet.
271036	im glad these fit , but they are too high . i dont like old lady undies . i thought they were going to be nicer or at least nice looking . i hope im never caught dead in these . luckily they go under clothes .
271061	i love this ring. love is what this world needs. i just adore it. once again another great buy via amazon. it is dainty yet very sturdy. what more can i say the price for awesome and so is this sweet little ring.
271072	i was excited to get this ring, but the &#34;love&#34; letters catch on almost everything. letters bend easily. buy something with more silver weight in the ring, because this is not the one.
271158	my tall 12 year old wears a size 11 but her foot is very skinny and narrow, so while the length fits her, it is very big-she can just slip her foot inside without touching the shoe and that's not a good thing. so while the tie-dye is very pretty, our biggest gripe is the roominess of the shoe. so just be forewarned about that issue, otherwise a really nice looking shoe. and very comfortable, too. colors are very vibrant as well.
271293	this does what i was hoping it would do which is to smooth out my shape. it fits well and although i haven't worn it for any lengthy period of time, it doesn't roll  over when i bend or twist. it doesn't feel like a torture device like the last one i wore. if you are looking for a corset type garment this might not be what you are looking for, but if you want a comfortable garment that smoothes your shape and still allows you to breathe, try this one.
271329	i love this dress, it fits me perfect, i am 5'10 a size 14 and  it hugs perfect in all the right places, material is a little thin but its not that bad. i am going to order 2 more colors...delivery was a little slow but color i got was spot on like the picture.
271355	i bought two of these winter fleece leggings in the colors  navy blue and grey.  the leggings are super soft, medium thick and and are lined with fleece on the inside. i'm from philadelphia pa and the weather has been under 40 degrees and my legs were not cold in these leggings. i'm 5'2 & 140 pounds and these leggings stops at my ankles and the waist is underneath my breast. the waist from the crotch measures 11 &1/2 inches and there are no front or back side to these  leggings. if you are over a size 10 ,i wouldn't recommend you buying these because the waist band might fit but the legs won't, so i guess it all depends how you carry your weight. the only thing i didn't like about the leggings was, when i recieved them they stunk so bad, i had to soak them in downy unstopables to get that putrid scent  out of the leggings. i have washed my leggings four times and the fabric did not create pilling or  fuzz balls.  the leggings are good but i don't know if  i will take the risk of getting another stinky leggings.
271386	i wish they made shorts for women that were this length and had the nice liner, but they don't.  soooo, gals like me are forced to buy men's shorts sometimes to keep 'stuff' covered yet still be able to move freely.  these are made well (kinda hot during a long session on the elliptical, but they still breathe), and the colors are plentiful.  100% recommend.
271392	fits my 7 yr old perfectly.  she is 48&#34; tall and 50 lbs.  a little pricey but definitely built to last.  recommend!!
271468	i did not like this dress! i measured and still the dress is way too tight! also the material is so cheap and overall it looks really terrible!
271505	this skirt is very cute.....i am 5'1 and it stops right above my knee. the only thing i didn't like was that it is very then even with a slip under it is very see threw...but with some cute tights and a cute sweater it will be a very cute outfit :-)
271509	the elastic waistband on these pants runs loose and large so you might want to get the next size smaller. i prefer the other type with an adjustable drawstring.  also these pants didn't shrink in length in the dryer that much. should fit someone up to 5' 10&#34; or so.
271525	love the dress but it is too big! most reviewers said it ran small that is not true. i am a size 0-2, 5'3&#34; 105lbs and i thought maybe if i ordered the us4 the dress would fit based on reviews. i was wrong and now i can't wear the dress. it's too big in the waist and arms.
271573	this is a cute hat.  my packaged arrived much sooner than i expected.  i liked it so much, i purchased more for christmas gifts next year.
271639	i bought a white one for me and a black one for my husband. to my surprise we loved them! they're thicker than they appear so they make amazing winter hats.
271664	they are super pretty. when i received them i looked at them closely and it looks like something vera wang would wear.
271717	i very much like this dress, it fits me well. i am normally about a medium, 5'2 and 138 lbs. however, i noticed that it only comes in one size. it might fit those that tend in between a medium and large, but probably this is a no-go for anyone who finds a large to be tight. this is a clingy dress, but very stretchy, i believe it would also fit those who would normally wear a small, but it wouldn't be tight. also, it's worth mentioning that the color is off. it's not a deep wine burgundy as pictured, but more of a scarlet red, much brighter.
271725	it smelt a little funny. i love the way it fits and spins. the fabric is alittle cheap looking but ill still wear it.
271733	this wrap/cardigan/blanket, is ok, hence the 2 stars.  the edges where the button holes are, to fasten to the shoulder buttons, were already coming apart after one wash, on the delicate cycle.  upon taking it out of the packaging, it had a very odd odor, that was not pleasant.  i don't really know how to describe it, other than foul. it literally stunk up the room. nasty. so i had to wash it immediately just to get the odor out of it.  which i did, and the odor luckily did disappear, however, it's falling apart as a result. so, basically, the $40 price is a bit high for such a cheaply made garment, however despite my disappointment with the quality, it is soft, and comfy, and now that i've washed and worn it, i'll be keeping, since it's a suitable casual sweater paired with jeans or leggings for hanging around the house.
271779	i got two of them one for me and one for my grand daughter, and we just love them lots
271784	just what i wanted, elegant and light. it feels really good on my finger too. it has diamond has shown.
271799	this is excellent quality at an unbeatable price. i returned it because the cups are too deep for me. if you're wider, shallower shape you may find that this bra has too much projection. the wires are average in length, and the straps are set slightly wider than most bras.
271801	this is a great t-shirt bra. i am a 28ff and have shallow breasts, and this bra fits me true to size. i own the jude t-shirt bra in the same size, and this one is more comfortable - the band is a bit loser, but snug enough to be very supportive, and the underwires are more concealed and less 'pokey' in this bra. the top of the cups on the maddie are just a bit visible under clingly tops (the jude is almost invisible under clothing), but it's not nearly as bad as other 't-shirt bras'. i can wear it all day without needing to adjust it. great purchase!
271806	it was for a friend , she likes it a lot too. hope it stays that way with use. hope to do bussines again
271866	i bought the white one and it was very cute. the material is very soft and pleasant on the skin. i will have to say this, and this goes for virtually all white shirts: it's a little see-through. furthermore, the front design goes a little lower along the cleavage than what i would usually wear. to each their own. i decided to layer a tight, red tank underneath for these very reasons, and the result was pretty amazing!
271902	very nice but if you have a small wrist this bracelet is not for you i have a small fist did not fit so gave it to my mom but she loved it to
271926	these pants are fun and comfortable, they do have a tight fit but not too tight. they fit comfortable and i can move freely. the design is nice. overall, a good buy for the price.
271932	flashy and fun leggings, fit me just fine, i'm 5'7, 115lbs. the material is a bit polyester-y and i'm a bit worried of them being stretched out but for now they will do just fine.
271948	fits just right and is very comfortable, flannel is my favorite fabric, color is perfect and i like the fitted cuffs on the sleeves
271951	i've been looking for dark brown boots for awhile and these are exactly what i wanted. i have somewhat wide calves and they zipped up no problem, but for those that have smaller calves don't worry, you can tighten them with the laces. they seem well made, really a great deal for the price.
272021	after reading the reviews i ordered up half a size but it probably wasn't necessary - i would say this fits true to size. shoe seems well made, comfortable, non-slip sole. insoles are abit too slippery for my liking though.
272056	i bought these to wear under some too thin leggings and they work great, they're warm and the fit is great.they don't ride down at the waist and i'm a size 16 so that says a lot. they're silky smooth feeling so i believethey could be worn under a dress without the dress riding up to the waist. there's ample stretch to them,so don't be afraid to try these at this low price.
272064	they're warm inside but, tight around the legs. i'll wear them anyway but, i wish they weren't so snug around the leg.
272114	these are super warm and i wear them only when it's cold but the butt side doesn't pull up as high as the stomach side.  i do not have a full butt, if anything it's rather flat so that couldn't be the reason.  other than the anomaly in the fit, i like them.  they are warm.
272204	this does ship from china so give it a few weeks to arrive, but you can't beat the price! mine is very good quality, thick and slouchy like in the photo. i have a large noggin, and this still fits like the photo shows. mine came with no funky smell and i was able to wear it the day it arrived. i have had many compliments on it and ordered one in 3 different colors to go with this one!
272219	this top fits just as described and is very comfortable and attractive. i've paired it with jeans and a belt and have paired it with slacks and accessories for work. i would buy this in more colors!
272220	fits well, stylish but not too baggy.  lovely wide neck design. fits snug at waist, but not tight. great color
272226	i love this cute nightshirt. it fits like a glove and is warm. i ordered the pink one, but will probably order at least two of the others.
272228	sizing was perfect. xl is about a 16. fabric quality above average. washes and dries well. nice conservative length. good value.
272257	very nice looking but after washing a few times the color fades and the seat became saggy.
272273	these pj bottoms are a great buy for the money.  material is very soft and the pants fit true to size.
272335	these leggings are so very comfortable!!! so very very comfortable! the material is so soft, i don't want to take them off.they fit me perfectly (5'8&#34; and 155lbs) easily reaching all the way down to the ankle and coming up to the waist and because they are heavy-weight they are not at all see through (which as we all know can be a problem). you won't have to worry about covering your bewty from prying eyes with this one!i will definitely be wearing these regularly and will probably get more pairs. they are warm enough to wear kind of like pants but so much more comfortable! highly recommended. legging of my dreams!
272359	great pjs. if you're between sizes order up. top is narrow in shoulders and chest. i'm 5&#34;8 and bottoms are a bit short.
272364	i bought one of these for my wife a while back.  it's ok. the material isn't the best and even though it was all poly it did shrink a little. for the money it wasn't a bad deal but i don't think i'd but them again.  i'd put the money towards some nicer - all flannel or fleece pjs.  you can get them for a little more money and the quality is much better.
272415	i got these to run a super hero 5k - fit was fine, stayed on for 3 miles and were actually quite warm.
272730	when i was first asked to to try out this bracelet, i was pretty skeptical about whether or not copper magnetic bracelets have any real benefits for arthritis pain like they are purported to.  still, i decided to give it a shot since i have an arthritic post-surgery knee that is still painful, as well as an occasional pain/stiffness in my basal thumb joint of my right hand when i'm sculpting with clay.in describing the bracelet, let me first say that i was very pleasantly surprised by the quality and attractiveness of this bracelet.  i've always been a fan of copper and the finish on this piece is softly brushed with very smooth edges -- not a rough spot to be found.  the width of the bracelet is about 3/8-inch and it's of a fairly thick gauge.  it's *just* bendable enough to easily slip on your wrist and tighten for a comfortable fit; but not so bendable that it loses its shape at all as you're wearing it.a total of over 12,000 gauss (the unit of measurement of magnetic fields) are delivered to the wrist area.  the six magnets are situated with three at each end and are inset into the thickness of the copper so that they are smoothly flush with the inner surface of the bracelet.a little background:  copper has been used since ancient times for health issues.  modern researchers think its benefit may have to do with the small amount of copper absorbed by the body.  and what about those magnets?  the theory of magnets in bracelets is that they will improve circulation -- which will reduce inflammation and improve tissue and nerve health.so, now for the good news and not-so-good news.  my knee is still screwy with no noticeable difference in pain.  but, the joint at the base of my thumb had been bothering me again for the past month.  and it's gone now.  so, what i don't know is if it just happened to go away on its own -- or did the bracelet help?  which means i'm still planning on wearing the bracelet to see if it is the cause of the thumb joint behaving better.while i may not be completely certain yet of this bracelet's effectiveness on arthritis, i'll continue to wear it in hopes that it is.  plus, it really is a nice-looking and well-constructed bracelet that is worth wearing for that reason alone.product sample was provided for reviewing purposes and arrived in a fabric draw-string pouch.  there was also a small informational e-book provided.**4.5 stars for now (i'll up the stars to 5 if/when i feel more positive that it's the cause of the improvement in my hand.)
272763	this is a fantastic purchase.  really nice fabric, hangs nicelyflattering, and adjustablehighly recommend it.  i purchased a large but could get a medium next time.i'm 5'5&#34;, 138 lb normally wear a 6
272889	i purchased this style top from 2 dif companies to compare them. i actually liked this one's coloring best, but when it arrived, i barely recognized it. the colors were very dif than the pic, the fabric was not the same quality as the other one purchased, but worst of all, it didn't fit. too small. i was so glad i had ordered 2 of these from dif vendors, or i would have thought i just can't wear this style. untrue. the other fit just fine. back went this one. return process was easy but not free.
272972	true to size and color. my hips are a 38 and i ordered a l. everyone should have this skirt.
272988	cuff on sleeve is way too tight...the elastic is too tight and so is the small area in the back of the trench.  one size for all but it isn't going to be too comfortable if you wear a size larger than a 7.  i wear 4 and 6's and still wish this had some more play in the fabric.  the seller is great...arrived fast.
272992	these leggings are exactly what i was looking for.  they are warm and cozy.  the outside of the legging is smooth (they feel silky ) and the fleece on the inside is very soft and warm.  these leggings are soooooo comfortable!  i put them on and they fit perfectly.  they are great to wear by themself, and perfect under a pair of jeans on those days when we have 12 below zero temperatures!
272995	i was thrilled at how well these leggings fit. they stay up better than any pair i have ever owned and the feel really soft. i am 5'6 and about 155 lbs and the one size (winter fleece) fit great. i am going to buy more in other colorsfyi they are not seamless, there is a seam running up the inside of the leg
273000	the leggings fit as expected, which is a shame because i would have kept them if they didn't have such a strong petrochemical smell. it was so overwhelming when i opened the package that i immediately felt dizzy and faint. i tried washing them a few times, thinking i could wash away the chemicals, but the smell remained and was still strong enough to cause headaches. i decided it wasn't good for anyone's health after feeling sick every single time i wore them or was even near them (like a canary in a coal mine, i am usually the first to see adverse reactions when exposed to chemicals that deteriorate the human body). i would not recommend, even if you don't think it will affect your own health.. the smell itself is enough reason not to buy.
273025	i received the pants really quick. i'm 5'4&#34; 125 and they fit just right.its not bulky due to lining at all. lining is very soft and warm. they are not see through. i got the charcoal grey and i love it.
273037	"these leggings are great for the price. the thicker option is very soft and consistently opaque even on ""luscious thighs"". kept me warm all afternoon in under 20 weather. only complaint is the material pills easily. i got a boot wear line the first day. wear boot socks to avoid that issue."
273074	i gave these to my daughter yesterday to wear under her clothes and she said they were fantastic and wants more.  she is a size 2 and i got the regular size so i wasn't sure about the fit but she said they were great.
273079	they fit fantastic.  they are great with boots or under a skirt for additional warmth.  they are soft and nicely proportioned.  the don't roll at the waist, and they are a nice length.  i ordered them in three colors, and have been happy with them all!
273162	perfect color much better than u see here.  the bracelet need adjustment of course but the case size is ok
273222	i have a problem with this shelf bra because i wear a 38 normally.  the cup design of this piece is sizes for a much smaller diameter breast.  i am built like the actress carmen electra and this piece is sized for a victorias secret model at best.  it digs into the sides and is not flattering.  if you look closely at the model in the product picture you can see the problem.
273225	i wear a b cup, and when wearing it, it looks like my breasts are ready to flop over it.
273292	hanes has a reputation in knitted goods that extends for over a century. in many ways their white athletic socks with grey toe and heel as well as the red stripe are the iconic men's casual sock. yep, they wear out but that's because when standing staring into your sock drawer, you're drawn to them, you know they'll fit, you can't get them too dirty, they're soft, comfortable so, naturally, you pick them up and put them on. men have been doing just that for decades and, one hopes they'll continue just that for many more centuries. of course i won't live for a couple more  centuries but as long as i'm around, i'll be buying them. as to the number of pairs. someone asked me if i didn't think that was overkill....who wears ten pair of socks? they miss the point. this is a good buy for something you will wear, they will wear out so...why not buy enough to avoid buying them in ones and twos? also, at the price offered, this is a bargain. when you can buy something that is a bargain, wears well, is known to you and that you like, why not buy it?
273332	this purse was much bigger than i expected but i like that.  it is perfect with casual or dressy attire.  the material is strong and the color is pretty accurate to the picture.
273512	it's a very beautiful looking pin because it's the symbol of the hunger games franchise and it also looks the same way on the cover of the novel but the mockingjay is facing in a different direction but still, it's a very nice pin. this is also a great buy for anyone who admires this series.
273515	this pin looks just like the one in the movie. it sells in hot topic and other stores for a much higher price so i would get it on amazon for sure. gave this to my niece for christmas in her stocking and she put it on right away! it is a great size, not too small and makes you feel like katniss!
273583	frankly speaking did not expect much, but it feels and looks better, than expected. soft and well-knitted.they are thin. colors do match. pictures are accurate.but, note, that these sweaters are bit tight, especially in turtleneck.i wear m and have ordered asia xl, but now i see, that asia xxl which they say is medium+ would probably match better.but as they are justs slightly tight - still ok.
273603	really cute, everything that touches your body is metal, so that is a plus. wish they'd make this with all metal, or glass beads. it is very pretty, and exciting. got here very fast too.
273609	the quality was ok for the price but it wouldn't stay on my ear so i gifted it to a friend with smaller ears.
273635	i love these sandals.  so much so that i have them in 2 colors.  the base of the sandal fits true to size, but the ankle area is a bit wide for me.  the velcro helps with adjusting though.  i wore them straight out of the box to a festival where i walked on concrete for hours with no issues.  extremely comfortable and stylish enough where they don't look like &#34;old lady&#34; sandals.  :-)
273640	these are great for our 3 yr old who doesn't always remember where he put his gloves.  now  we just clip them to his coat and it saves us time and the headache!! perfect!!also, these work great for my 16 yr old when she wears boots.  we clip them to the bottom on her pants and it wraps around the bottom of her foot.  they keep the jeans nice and tight under the boots.  no more bunching up and riding up pants!  multipurpose item!
273653	not the absolute best quality but i only paid 99 cents so i wasn't expecting sterling silver haha i'm very happy with this item and i highly recommend it to anyone who loves skulls. the designs all over the skull are wonderful and i've gotten compliments a few times. i've worn it at least four times and it hasn't brokenall i say to anyone on here ordering low priced jewelry is this; remember that this is very low in price so do not expect something of extremely high quality. be gentle, don't constantly tug on it and don't throw it on your counter when you're done wearing it, and always apply a coat of clear nail polish to avoid that green coloration on your skin and so that the silver or gold &#34;shine&#34; doesn't go away. if you remember these things you will be highly satisfied and you will have your piece of jewelry for a very long time.also, always remember to read the reviews before you order. ignore anyone who makes it obvious that they skipped reading the reviews and who is angry and ranting but doesn't deserve to do so. had they done their research they would have known they didn't want to order the item because it wasn't their taste and they wouldn't be posting things that aren't true - making it out to be worse than it is, making it out to be ugly just because they're mad, etc. and there's always going to be people who complain because that's what some people like to do. only take into account the well thought out reviews and you'll know what to expect!
273684	"ok it's so cheap and no shipping...how can you go wrong?  it's the type of thing that if you saw it at a garage sale for 10 you wouldn't get it.  the metal part is sort of rough and tarnished and not comfortable at all.  the heart and ""wings"" are accurately depicted in the picture, though, so you really see what you're getting there.  if you got this for a very specific costume, it's ok.  for casual wearing...not so much.  but it gets 3 stars instead of fewer because it's worth exactly its price."
273688	i have not received my ring yet, but the necklace is great! i wear it a lot. i can't wait to get the ring.
273765	samsung gas done it again. i'm a watch fanatic and love this watch. after you wear it for awhile you get sopiled by the easiness and great interaction with the phone, in my case the note 3.
273799	this dress fits perfect the size is what you get don't have to get a size larger. i love the way it hugs to the shape of my body. the length was perfect knee length.
273876	i agree wholeheartedly with many of the reviews here. very unflattering fit around the chest/breast area. if you are considering buying this jacket, do yourself a favor and don't. too expensive to ship back once you get it here and are dissatisfied! if you decide to disregard the reviews, then get a size or two larger.
273882	nice color. very comfortable pants. the shirts this company makes are fabulous.  great compression. my husband loved the comfort of these compression leggings.  but for the price, we are going to look for more compression. we highly recommend the compression long sleeve shirts this company makes. this company is very interested in customer feedback. impressive.
273925	i like this sweatshirt because it is nice and soft against the skin and fits well, i just didn't know that it slouches off the shoulder
273929	no it does not come with a belt but considering the price and how fantastically it fit i was more than ok providing my own belt. i liked the black one i ordered so much i ordered one in red as well!
273932	i love this top! i don't have the guts to pull it off as a dress. looks great with jeans, leggings or a short shirt. definitely wear a wide fashion belt with it to give you a shape!
273942	i can't praise these shorts enough! they hug all my parts just right and don't ride up! that was the biggest surprise. i really, really, appreciate the front pockets and the compliments they earn. they arrived a few days sooner than the estimated time and i put them on immediately to no disappointments. this seller is great.
273956	for $35-$40, it is basically an overpriced fleece jacket.  buttons are fancey, and give the look of being &#34;double- breasted&#34; ... but still a cheaper material than what i paid for it
273965	i was given this coat as an early christmas present (due to weather) and it fits perfectly. i'm a small gal and this is just so incredibly snug of a fit i'd recommend it to anyone. it especially keeps you warm due to biting type wind so helps a lot, also it's not as thick as i thought it would be so definitely wear a sweater underneath.
273970	i like the coat a lot but only gave it 4 stars because it was not as heavy/thick as i had thought it would be. its well made and i love the style but its more of a fall and spring coat then a winter jacket. the fit is perfect. i bought a large and i can definitely wear a heavy sweater underneath.
274070	it's a nice hat it fits good to me, it look good and very comfortable to wear! buy buy buy :)
274086	these are very cute little rose earrings. i got the 6 pair pack with all the colors. the colors are all true to shade. they are about a 1/4 of an inch in diameter; so a little smaller that i expected.
274114	i like these pajamas a lot. they are kind of thin for a flannel, so don't expect them to keep you super warm, but for just kickin around the house they are perfect. the cut of the legs is very flattering, so you still look cute even in pajamas. the bottoms of each leg have a thicker almost starched ring, which is good so they don't get beat up. as seen on most reviews, they do not have pockets, but whatever. they are soft. i wear these all the time. i'm considering ordering another pair. i'm about a size 10/11 (curvy) in pants, and i got the large. perfect fit.
274132	the bag is nice. i'm returning it though because i wanted a handbag and this bag is almost large enough to be a work bag or a small overnight bag. it's very stiff and not flexible so it really reminded me of luggage. if you like big bags, this one is nice.
274136	fit perfectly fine and i am a size small.  i do recommend! it also arrived way earlier than the time appointed.
274152	i love the breckelle's georgia women's lace-up boots.  they fit perfectly and the side zipper makes them so easy to slip on.  the boots arrived on time and in excellent condition.
274163	being a pear-shaped woman, i'm not too keen to let it all hang out on the beach.  found these and they were exactly what i was looking for.  they are cute, stylish, trendy and fit perfectly!  i love the little tie at the sides.  highly recommend!
274180	so excited. i haven't found a suit that i have really loved in so long. i received my order today which was this tanktini top and another from the same company ,they arrived sooner then the posted dates. i'm 5'3 128 lbs i usually purchase a medium but some reviews said they run a little small and some posted that the size was right on. i ordered a large because i don't like tight fitting suits and i knew the straps would help for swimming purposes. i didn't expect much from my order because its hard to find a great suit that you love while shopping in person and a greater risk on line. i  expected that this either wouldn't fit right or the quality would be poor and i would hate it. i knew i could return it either way ( didn't fit, didn't like). all i can say is wow. looks great on, fits great and the quality is better then suits i paid $100.00 for. i would say this runs close to size. i wanted a little loose in tummy area and  its perfect. i might have been able to go with a medium but this works. so comfortable and the style and  pattern i thought might look too much of a retired women's style but its not. also the suit feels light weight but well made. the bust area has better support then i expected with light padding. i hope it holds up well , it will be a winner all the way around.  if you like this on line, you'll love it when it arrives.great quality, good fit, nice price.
274190	this fit just as i wanted it too. i can't wait until summer to wear it to the beach and lake. built in bikini bottom and just enough skirt to make me feel secure. i love it...
274232	perhaps the leather isn't all that cheap, but it certainly doesn't look good.  the edges are really crappy looking, like a machine just roughly hewed the strip and someone forgot to clean it up.  i just wouldn't recommend this belt at all.
274255	the material is very thin. the heel grip doesn't really work. i feel it wouldnt last long in the washer. plus, these were a bit big for me. i wear size 8.5 shoes. the socks still shows a little bit when wearing sperries. would not buy again.*************************updatethe seller has promptly addressed my dissatisfaction and gave me a full refund. i didn't even have to return it. a+ for customer service.added one star just for that.
274263	i bought these for my husband. they work very well in keeping a tie from sliding around or even flopping forward too much when bending over. you dont see them when worn and they are constructed of a sturdy plastic which enables them to be reused over and over again.
274264	i almost kicked myself when these arrived and i saw how simply made it was.  this is merely a strip of plastic sheeting with  button-holes at each end.  but for $6.99 its probably equivalent to sitting around cutting thin plastic into the shape and punching the holes.for those in doubt - its a ridiculously simple idea but works very well.  5 stars.
274296	i place the order knowing these will run smaler, im small so i ordered medium and it fits perfectly! i does not look cheap. i gave it 4 starts because it have a double fabric under the neck and i dont love how its look, in other hand you can cutting or leave it that way. i ordered in white and pink cuz i couldnt decide witch i want the most, and i still cant.
274307	when i saw this blouse charm me, i buy size m and l is the greatest, i'm staying, i'm sad because i really like this blouse.i am very sorry, because i'm from dominican republic and i can not return the blouse, i regret not using it, so sorry
274333	my 11-year old daughter loves these slippers.  she says they are very comfortable and warm.  they fit well and are washable, which i like, although i have not tested them in this way yet.  understand that there are no soles like in a shoe as the bottom is made of the same material.
274377	i love this shirt it's absolutely gorgeous! it fits perfect and i couldn't ask for better! id defiantly recommend and buy this as gifts for family i love it!
274443	i gave this product 5 stars because it was delivered on time it was carefully packaged.  the material is high quality and i like the color scheme
274470	this dress is super see through. i loved the design but it is definitely short (even thou i have ordered size up) and it is made of super cheap material i can't even explain how chip is the material.
274471	you get what you pay for, the material is sheer. this dress is okay, didn't really give me the &#34;wow factor&#34; when i opened the package.
274473	i didn't know how it was going to fit, or if i was going to like it. when i received it in the mail and took it out of the package i loved it! i never ordered any clothes from amazon before but i will more now. i am 4' 11.5'' and weigh 107 and it fit me perfect, i ordered a small. others had said that the material was cheap, but you cant expect a whole lot out of something that doesn't cost a lot. i thought the material was fine. it looks just like the picture. i would recommend this to others!
274537	i've been wearing champion pants for a number of years.  very comfortable.  as my old pants are wearing out, i ordered a couple of new pairs.  i would rate them as five stars except for the waistband.  incredibly uncomfortable.  very scratchy.  have to wear a t-shirt tucked in with them in order to be comfortable.  why change a good thing?
274545	i love it because its a cute style for winters in florida!! also i can wear it with so many outfits! it fits great and is really stretchy!
274549	love the color, top fits ok but the pants are a little to short and big for me, would love longer pants.
274569	this is a very lightweight backpack which can be folded up for easy storage. the case which the bag folds into is attached to the backpack itself and is converted into a pouch to carry objects like pens, wallet, compass, cell phone or smaller items you want to access quickly.it is perfect for traveling or hiking as it could hold several books, a laptop, clothes, or supplies without trouble. there is even a side mesh for holding a water bottle. it is a bit smaller than other backpacks that i've had. i can fit 4 college textbooks in this bag, but i wouldn't recommend carrying all four as it seems to be a little too heavy for the bag.the material which the bag is made from seems to be good quality, but the straps do not seem to be ultra-heavy duty so i don't think you'd want to pack anything too heavy in the backpack. however, the straps are very comfortable and highly adjustable.
274584	cute - i get lots of compliments!  but it slips a lot :/  because it's really just a tube of material, it'll form to your body, but slide up or down..
274665	i received this product recently and i hate how it looks and fits. this dress has a bad smell to it. will be returning it back for a refund.
274751	these earrings are great -- they appear to be real and there's no worry about losing them because of the leverback.
274795	i didn't want to come off too bootylicious so returned the skirt. but if you are confident to show off your big round butt, this is the skirt for you.
274801	i wasn't sure i would like this skirt but it is comfortable and looks really nice. i'm impressed. i am a personwho believes that knees are not a pretty part of a woman....so i don't like showing knees so this is right below my knee.i am 5'5''
274804	i'm 5'4&#34; 125. i ordered the medium and the fit was just right. its very nice and comfortable. the length is perfect. it's very hard to find skirts that are knee length so i'm very happy with this one. looks exactly like the picture. thinking of ordering more colors. i recommend this skirt.
274868	i wore this necklace with a simple black dress to a formal wedding. when the necklace arrived it came in a nice black box, but i was nervous because it appeared to be a little cheap. although i do believe the quality is on the cheaper side, i think i'll be able to get a few wears out of it. great spring/summer color. can be dressed up or down. would definitely purchase again in another color.
274874	love this bag! perfect size for a carry on or overnighter. great dimensions and super cute.this is going to get a ton of use!
274883	love the pattern on these but they didnt fit very well. got them in a large (size i normally get leggings) and they were too small. i would suggest getting them in a larger side if you're on the hippier side
274906	"""infinity"" scarf is a fine concept: a scarf that 'has no ends', meaning the two normal ends are sewn together. in this case, the ends are somehow knitted together but i think they may just be sewn.this is a versatile, lovely idea for those on the run and those who really need scarf-warmth. i sometimes wear scarves around the house in winter, and this ingenious invention (how did i not think of it?) saves me a lot of trouble. there's no fussing with a long, flapping scarf because, well, this has no ends!this is 100% acrylic and my wife is completely ga-ga for these. trouble is, and the good news is, if you own scarves and a sewing machine you can just make your own! which is what i am going to do!also a word of advice: be aware that this seller is in singapore (well, they are actually in china, a chinese company and they mail from china). if you do not mind the wait, and i certainly do mind long waits, this will take about a month to reach you."
274907	this is a nice looking scarf. i was disappointed in it at first because it looked nothing like the picture, then i figured out that it's an infinity scarf and needs to be doubled to look the way it does in the picture. i like the infinity style because you don't have figure out where to put the scarf ends. i may get more colors.
274936	i did not enjoy  this product. the material is poor quality and fits really loosely. looks bulky under any pants or skirts. rough to the touch and the colors i got were nothing like the ones in the picture - unattractive shades of dark green, dark blue and cheap looking prints.
274952	exactly what i was looking for. you can wear it higher to make it shorter for a night out or lower to make it a [slightly] longer skirt for more conservative needs. i love the bandage style, pulls you in at all the right places. fits just right-- it's not too tight that you wind up feeling strangled in the abdomen. for a reference on size-- i'm 5'8&#34;, 165 lbs.
274998	it is a perfect fit and is right about your waist area, doesn't make it baggy like others. i have another one which is reviewed by me as well.
275062	perfect lightweight spring scarf. got the 2 pack of teal/white and earth/black - have had soooo many compliments. colors are true to photo (at least on the ones i ordered).
275105	this is such a sexy little dress!!!!!! i am 5'2&#34;, 32/26/36 and the fit is absolutely perfect!!!! excellent length too, so it's sexy and curvy without being trashy
275131	it looks very nice tied in any way, and could be worn with a top and jeans or with a dress. the fabric is soft but has body so it isn't limp, but neither is it stiff. it's perfect for what it is and easy and comfortable to wear. i look good in black, and i can add this scarf to any blouse or top that doesn't particularly flatter my coloring and still have black near my face to look better. and what color can you &#34;not&#34; wear with black?!
275154	got these for my gf who is a huge kitty fan. they look great on her 5'5&#34; 118lb (slender/athletic) build, good fit. the cat design sits at her lower-thigh but cleanly above the knee (works well with the usual modern dresses or mini-skirts).the kitties' forms are pronounced (it's obvious what they are, even at a distance), and in this &#34;thicker&#34; version the colors are very solid (no see-through on the opaque parts). the transparent upper-thigh makes it really look like she's wearing thigh-highs.highly recommended.
275190	these are good quality but run a half to a full size larger than they are and they are snug at the top of the leg and loose on the foot they do have elastic allowing them to expand on the lower thigh i wore them with skinny jeans but other than that i love them.
275209	i've been struggling with the sizing of the palazzo style pants.  ordered a large and it swallowed me....literally.  so when i ordered these pants i went with a small which actually works!  i love the fact i am wearing a small, haven't been able to say that in years...lol.just make sure that you order these keeping in mind that they run quite large.
275267	it fits perfectly!! not see through but nice and thin and comfy. i got many compliments while wearing it! i recommend it!!
275289	these are cheap boots so i had low expectations.  they definitely aren't something that is going to hold up to heavy wear over the years but they are decent quality for the price and very cute.
275299	these are really nice boots, especially for the price. they are very comfortable and keep my feet warm. now don't expect thsm to look like $100 bucks, but they don't look too cheap either, no glue hanging out, sloppy seams or plastic looking &#34;leather&#34;. the fur looks nice too. you can't beat these for the price.
275305	i got these for work, i stand all day and there not perfect but they don't rub funny or give me blusters. they keep my legs warm and dry.
275330	i loved the design of this wallet, with the clear slot to display id on the outside and its compact size. however, it falls short in person. for one thing, the makers call the color cherry, but it's closer to burgundy. more importantly, the zippers are stiff and awkward, and you need both hands and much maneuvering to get them closed. this isn't a good thing in a wallet that's supposed to be carrying loose change. it's a good idea, but if i'd seen this wallet in person i'd never have bought it.
275381	fit as expected.  very good workmanship.  it's been to cold to wear for any length of time, but, so far they don't &#34;bag&#34; after a few hours.  i wish their were colored denim shorts.  great price
275392	don't buy this if you need it quickly, but it is lovely.  i am so glad that i ordered it.  i can't wait for my daughter to see it in her stocking.  she is going to be thrilled.  i'm glad i order it with plenty of time for it to arrive.
275395	this hat is way better quality than i expected. the knit is actually quite thick. my 2 main complaints is that it causes my hair to get very staticky, and that the post office didn't want to deliver it. the ears don't sit quite like they do in the picture but overall this is my favorite purchase from an overseas seller.
275443	i was expecting something more chunky and well made.  but the actuality of the earrings do not live up to the gorgeous image.
275527	i can't get it to do what the picture looks like.  unless they have two scarfs in one pictures.  if that's the case, the picture should state that.  it's soft and comfortable, but that's it.  i might buy another one, just to see if this works w/ two, because it does not work w/ one.  even the contained pictures in the bag are not even close for what you can really do w/ this scarf
275541	i've recently bought several pattyboutik tops and have loved all but one.  this is one i definitely love.  casual yet still looks adorable and somewhat dressy, if need be.  patty shirts tend to run somewhat on the small size so i did go up a size in this and it's still form fitting.  love these tops!
275649	i love this necklace!  it arrived in the mail on saturday and i've only taken it off for sleeping and showering.it's very beautiful and delicate; not something you'd wear for sleeping or showering.  it's not too delicate, though, and i think it will be fine to wear on a daily basis.  i've had troubles in the past with chains that have broken just through daily wear.i really like this and can't wait for the snow to melt - we have over seven inches - so that i can leave the house and show it off to everyone!
275737	these men's slippers live up to the isotoner's brand reputation.  i bought them for guests to use while visiting my home, along with other isotoner men's and women's slippers.  well made.  seem to be especially good for fall or spring in cold climates--and for all year round in moderate climates.
275756	very nice design, nice bright red, but their sizes run small, the large is more like a small. the dress was a little to short for my liking.
275772	i purchased this for a work holiday uniform and wore it 4 days in one week. even though i got several compliments for wearing it, you must know that it is not a high quality looking dress. i am rather curvy which makes most things i wear look better than they otherwise look so i think that is in large part why the dress at least fit me perfectly. but from reading other reviews i was thinking i was getting so,etching more than cheap red material. i will admit the gold embellishment at the top of the keyhole definitely adds one element of quality.
275826	i am from baltimore, md. i ordered this ring on january 5, 2014, and received it on february 5, 2014. very fast shipping for an item from china. i read the reviews before buying this ring. people were saying this ring is a size 6 or 7. i disagree. this ring is super small and probably will only fit a slender childs finger. the golden ring looked nice for an item i paid 43 cents for, but it is useless to me because super small. i wasn't too fond of the golden color either, the gems were the only nice thing about it.
275869	yellow lenses are best for evening and nighttime viewing. these glasses work as advertise. great for cloudy days, late afternoon and nighttime. they turn the blue sky white and enhance all colors. while driving at night they turn white light yellow. can be worn all times except bright sunshine.
275903	i looked at a lot of different booties before buying these, and i'm glad i chose to go with these. the price is reasonable and they are great! even though they are a bit big on my 3 month old, the velcro closure keeps them tight on her ankles and they keep her feet warm. i've gotten lots of compliments and will be getting another pair for next winter.
275924	these undies fit great, the leg holes are accommodating, they are exactly what i wanted and expected.  nice price too.
275944	sizing is away off. i ordered a size or two higher than i normally would, and it was still too small and tight. it's also not as high as pictured, so if you have a long  torso, this may not cover up over your belly button.the fabric is cheap and doesn't give very much, which was what i'd expected when ordering it for $13. it's more like exercise clothes fabric, bit really like bathing suit fabric.
275989	i bought this a half size up from my normal shoe size and so that part fits perfectly. yes this boot has a slender shaft. i measured mine in key parts and got 15&#34; circumference for the calf and 16&#34; circumference for the knee. i got mine on and am wearing them while in bed writing this review to try and stretch the shaft out an inch or so. for less than $25 i feel like i got a pretty decent value. the boots are cute, just be aware of the dimensions and sizing or you will be disappointed. i uploaded 2 pictures with them on so you can see how they fit me, i have a 29&#34; inseam and weigh about 140 pounds.
276024	dress was exactly like pictured. i ordered the black.  i am 5'8&#34; and usually wear a size 16 dress so the 16/18 was the largest size.  it's a little snug, but it achieves the form fitting look that i was going for.  this dress is going to blow my husband's mind for our 8th wedding anniversary coming up next week, and i can't wait to do the sexy walk for him in it.  also, i ordered it on a friday and it arrived on monday....fast, fast, fast!!
276027	there has been quite a bit of criticism on this hat because of the way that it is shipped and that it is mis-formed when received ...  but, come on ... its a $7 hat that your buying on-line from another country. its not going to be shipped in a form fitting hat box! it arrived in decent time; before the expected arrival date. i took it out of the bag, played with the brim a bit, and set it on a shelf for about a week and it reformed just fine. i love the hippie look it adds to summer outfits. great buy!
276070	im 5&#34;4' 200 pounds and an hour glass shape.  i knew from the a-line style that it would fit me perfectly. mossimo can run small so i ordered the xxl.  i wear it with my leggings and knee high boots. the sleeves are 3/4 length so i just wear bracelets with it. this was not a deal breaker for me. also the material is almost like a true pullover hoodie material but a little stiffer. still very comfy and my new favorite weekend dress!!
276071	i like this dress it will fit later this summer once i lose 10 lbs.  then i'll let you guys know what i really think!
276143	although the picture looks so pretty, this dress is very poorly made. not only is the material cheap and unacceptable as professional attire, but there are threads hanging from all over the dress. this thing was whipped together. i am very unhappy with this purchase. i can only hope that i will be accepted for a refund. if not, i will never purchase from this seller again.
276153	cute dress, i'm 5'2'' 127lbs 32b i purchased the 4/6 size for work but i should have went one size up...its pretty snug.
276161	really?!  putting a 1/4 piece of rubber on the bottom of a boot as a sole.  absolutely no arch support, just totally flat.  that is what i call a slipper, not a boot.  very cheap for a reason.
276169	love this sandal!! it is so comfortable.  i can wear all day and never have tired feet.  i want one in every color!
276175	there is nothing i love more than organizing and when it comes to jewelry, not everything fits in my jewelry box or is easy to keep from getting tangled with other jewelry inside the box. my jewelry box has compartments but not enough and that is where this hanging jewelry box comes in. it's really a great idea.there are pockets for more than everything and the satin feels strong and nice on the hands. although the see through compartments are nice, i much prefer the satin pockets alone as they won't become brittle and crack in the low humidity of my area. it hangs nicely on the back of my door and i find myself wearing more jewelry, more often as it's so easy to look at everything at once and make a decision of what to wear. this would make a perfect gift for those who love their bangles and bling!
276189	i typically avoid being the first to purchase something but i am so happy about this. it's adorable! the head moves separately from the body which i think is an added plus. i run kennels of compassion, a rescue in arizona and desertcats.org is my program so i'm very into cats. i wanted some cat jewelry and couldn't find anything that was low priced. suddenly this and another piece popped up and i'm so happy that i saw it and ordered these. i got one for myself and one for my mom and we are both extremely happy with them. i definitely recommend for young and old!all i say to anyone on here ordering low priced jewelry is this; remember that this is very low in price so do not expect something of extremely high quality. be gentle, don't constantly tug on it and don't throw it on your counter when you're done wearing it, and always apply a coat of clear nail polish to avoid that green coloration on your skin and so that the silver or gold &#34;shine&#34; doesn't go away. if you remember these things you will be highly satisfied and you will have your piece of jewelry for a very long time.
276215	i bought this to wear with some black leggings and holy cow i look amazing!  it fits great, it's made well, the sleeves are nice and long.  it's a warm dress but it's not sweltering.  it's great for my office because we always have to ac on way too high! at 5'7&#34; and 135 lbs the medium fits perfectly and the stretchy fabric makes me look curvy and delicious!  it's a great buy!
276229	the skirt is a little thin but i think it will be ok for summer time.  great price for the value.  love the length!!!  i may have to get a few more in different colors.
276255	the colors are so soft and refreshing.  plan to purchase more for a women's retreat in the fall of this year.
276275	nice size, color true to picture, but prettier on the actual item. all of the edges are nicely hemmed is even. i deducted one star because of the rediculously slow shipping/delivery time. recieved another scarf i ordered at the same time from another vendor in half the time. over all, if you are not in a hurry this is worth the wait.
276326	i was so happy when i got these. they were a bit tight on the route area but i could deal. nope! after twenty minutes of walking the tendons on my foot gave out from the pain. i know of i could go a size up it would be too big
276359	this came quickly, and it's a pretty little ring.  i would be happy with it except for the fact that it's not the size 7 that i ordered, even though it had a tag on it saying &#34;size 7.&#34;  it's not even a size 6, or i could wear it as a pinky ring.  it's more like a 5 or a 5 and 1/2.  i am going to give it to my cousin's little girl.  she will love it.  if i could figure out how to compensate for the small sizes, i would probably order another one.  i have no idea how it holds up over time, but it's a very pretty little ring.
276411	the jacket shown was not what i ordered. the zipper broke the very first day. because i was in the hospital a few weeks i wasn't able to open the product right away, leaving me stuck with this product because the return policy lapsed
276468	i ordered this (blue white stripes) to wear to an 4th of july event.. got it 3x..it fits perfectly..i'm 5 foot 4 and 180..with large breasts..it covered well, looked great with a shrug and white 4 inch heels..very pleased
276496	this darn thing is not what i expected. its not as long as the picture portrays. the sleeves are ok (they come all the way to my wrists)but its &#34;sweater shirt like&#34;. i'm 5'2 32b 127lbs, ordered a light pink medium and it stops above my belly button! annoying, i'll probably give it away to a baby!
276561	i couldn't believe it when i received my dress and tried it on.  i looked marvelous!!! my husband couldn't stop looking at tme.  even my daughter was amazed.  i purchased this dress to attend a formal party on saturday, april 19th and i can't wait to walk into the party.  thank you seller for such a fabulous product.  the shipping was very fast also.
276585	this bra took a long time to arrive - it was a lot flimsier than i expected.  the fit is true to size and comfortable but doesn't provide near the lift that the picture does; at least for me!  it seems to be of the quality one would expect from ross or marshall's discount type stores.
276613	if you wanna waste your money on a piece of cheap see through cloth that is poorly sewn together go ahead by all means... after writing my first review i was contacted by this seller and they offered a refund... here's the trick only if i removed my honest feedback! that just won't do! everyone should know that the quality of this &#34;garment&#34; is beyond poor so you can stay away and not waste your time.. also don't be fooled by that gorgeous picture. it's not what you're getting. i will be contacting amazon for a proper refund as i won't stand some third party company from china trying to pressure me into deleting any honest feedback.
276616	i love this so much!!! i didn't know if it was going to come in two seperate pieces or what! but it's one full piece and other than it's difficult to zip all the way up by yourself... it's really cute and formfitting.  i have a little tummy pouch and the ruffles cover it really well (;it's a good length.. not too short to where you can't wear it to work. it smelled really weird though when i opened it, but nothing a washing machine can't fix!!! (:
276646	i got this tunic for traveling overseas. very comfortable top and stylish. perfect to wear it with leggings. in fact the stewardess , in the plane, complimented me for my outfit!
276660	these boots are so cool looking on my feet.  thinking about more colors! they came quickly and i have no regrets!!
276676	i have fibromyalgia and have a very hard time finding shoes that i can tolerate on my feet. i love these sandals. they are comfortable and i can wear them all day without my feet hurting.
276686	the width if the straps are a bit wide. it's made with a plastic type material so the width of strap won't shrink. very comfortable feels like you have nothing in your feet.
276728	this wasn't exactly what i was expecting. it does run a little large but i know its supposed to be big. the material is shiny and more stretchy then i was expecting. if your looking for something to wear out to a club or bar i can see this being appropriate but its not a work shirt. the colors are very vibrant. it's a cute shirt, just not what i had in mind.
276802	the dress fits as expected and i love it. only negative was the shipping time. if you can make more in different colors and improve shipping time you'd sell thousands.
276806	fits like you can use it for special serious ocassions. color isn`t extraordinary. fits all right!! must need to send it to fix according my tall and measures.
276810	i thought the quality was poor, felt scratchy, and fit kind of on the small side. old navy has better than this. had to pay return shipping, which was annoying, but at least i didn't have to keep it. wasn't a winner.
276816	i was hoping for a smaller pant. they are very long and also big in the waist.  havnt decided yet if i'll return them, hem them or try to shrink them yet
276817	these pants are super cute and i love the coral color, i really wanted something summery that i could dress up or down and still be comfy for running around or going out this summer. i bought the large, and while they fit fine through the legs, the part that covers the butt is much too short, and crack was showing. this may not be a problem for a woman with a non-existent booty, but for women with real bodies this ain't gonna fly. the fold over waist band does nothing to hold up these pants, which the waist was much too big. they are also very, very long, so that they may need to be hemmed (i'm 5'5&#34;). basically, these didn't work for me and i probably won't wear them.
276859	i ordered the aqua green in a medium and it's definitely not what i expected. i'm 5'4, 120lbs and i intentionally ordered a size up so they wouldn't be looser fitting, but they still fit like a small; the sizing is way off.the color isn't like the pair shown in the picture, it's more green than blue, they're actually not aqua at all.. very misleading. i would not recommend this for women, unless you have to body of a 12 year old.
276867	this dress is nice. the material is soft. i got a small, but i usually wear an xs. i should have gotten the xs. the small fits, but not as close as i'd like it to. the embroidery is pretty as well.
276944	this is super cute and its comfy as well! i always get a lot of compliments when i wear it!  clear coat it because the metal may change colour and use oinment if you have sensitive ears!
276949	its okay. the metal used to make it is very heavy and i had a problem with it falling off my ear when the cuff would give way. but i didn't pay very much for it so im not too disappointed. maybe if you have larger ears (mine are kind of larger) it will hold better.
276955	i bought 3 bracelet from this seller.this braclets looks like photo has a light plastic feel to it.nice and fashionable.
277026	this looks great online but in reality it is very flimsy and cheaply made. it literally broke from me gently handling it. luckily i was able to fix it by re attaching one of the links. it came from china and took weeks to arrive. it looks cute on hopefully it wont break again.
277067	i normally wear an 8-10 or medium, but i read that this dress ran small so i ordered 2 sizes up and it was still too small. i returned the dress, but am thinking of ordering an xxl (wow! never ordered that size before). i don't know what type of measuring this dress maker is using, but it is definitely wrong!!also, material is not that thick, was a little see through at the bottom but not too bad.
277102	this dress fits great, i should wear a medium but ordered an xl because of other reviews.  being from china, everything runs really small...2 sizes too small.
277126	i hope they restock on all the sizes because i'm a small and i want one of these in different colors!the fit is perfect.
277148	it does not look as pictured. it is a cheap stretchy material very spandex like but if fits cute if you have a cute shape.
277151	the dress looks exactly like the picture but the material is a little shinny which could make it appear cheap or i will appear cheap and for sale. i am on the fence as to if i will return or keep.
277189	it def looks better on the image than it does in person. it looks cheap nut i'm gonna make the best of it
277223	i bought these for house flops.  comfy shoe.  cured my foot pain.  my son noted that the white color on the brown seemed odd.  i kind of like it.  ;-)
277258	i love this dress! i am petite (size 6) curvy and it makes me look my best.  the colors are just beautiful.  the price is unbelievable! i wish i could give it more stars.  i am expecting the green dress and hope it is just as beautiful.
277337	these are more like boxer shorts-very thin. fit is ok and i will wear to workout at home or to sleep. for the price, i'm not too disappointed.
277380	this is the best fitting maxi dress i own!  most in this style don't fit me right as although i'm small i have a larger than average bust.  not at all flattering for me having an empire waist that starts above the line - or - one that gaps open at the neckline.  this is the answer to my dreams.  there is enough overlay at the neckline to keep things modestly covered w/out looking old lady-ish.  the added shirring on the straps keeps this dress looking soft while adding more fullness to the panels.  i wish they offered more styles just like this one.  it's cool to wear - looks wonderful and i love it.  wish they offered more patterns in this very style.
277430	i was hoping this dress would be a nice, light, summer maxi dress. the fabric is indeed lightweight, but the dress itself is lacking in quality, even for the low price that i paid for it. the way it is hemmed at the bottom and the quality of the print make it look and feel more like a cheap halloween costume than a nice casual dress. the colors are also not true to the photo--the beige-ish green color is actually more of a light green in person. the color scheme itself still looks nice, but it threw me off to have it be so different than the photo--at first i actually thought they had sent me the wrong color.as far as fit goes, the dress was way too short to be considered a maxi. i ordered a medium, and although the top fits fine, the bottom dangles at least six inches from the tops of my feet. for reference, i'm about 5'7&#34;.
277477	this dress is very pretty and it seems there is no front or back to it so i can get dressed in the dark and not have to worry about it. it is a nice fabric that will be light and breezy when the weather turns too hot. its very comfy and not tight or constricting in any way.
277541	this is a vey cute kids shirt.  it has that shine that you see with polyester,  and my nephew said it is very comfortable.i do think it is a little small, so i suggest you buy a size larger than you need.if you know a kid into soccer, they will love this shirt.i also think this would make a great halloween outfit...all you need is a whistle!  :)i received a shirt to test and review.
277559	i love these palazzo pants. the fabric is wonderful, the fit is really nice, and there is a good variety of colors!
277566	these are the best pants i've ever gotten here. the bottom of the leg is wide but very flattering, i feel so easy in them. you can have them narrowed down at the leg bottom if you like, but the way they are, feel and look very tailored--they don't ''balloon out''. they feel slinky. they look good with crop tops or tops that go over b/c the waist is high. you can also fold the waist down if you want, (they're your slacks). they're slimming also, if you're looking for that.  i wear a size 10/12 and could have ordered smaller, but they feel fine a little looser than usual.i wouldn't be surprised if they made me dinner, too. i love these pants!
277571	this top is a dead ringer for one from a very expensive line of designer clothes being sold on qvc called logo by lori goldstein. however, a top like this one will run you about $50 for one + $7 in shipping/handling charges over there. save your money, and buy your tee shirts here on amazon. this top fits a little bit large, but better too large than too small. it's flowy and long enough to be able to wear over leggings. makes a nice layering piece as well. i got mine in light peach and it's very pretty. i will be back for more, once i see how this one washes up. fabulously comfortable, and a great buy!!!!!
277592	this skirt was so small, i ordered a large but it fit skin tight, it was more like a xsmall. i guess you get what u pay for.
277648	i am so excited about this dress! i was not expecting anything near the quality of the product i got. the price, the fit and the variety of colors and styles will bring me back for more! i get nervous ordering things online, especially dresses, due to my big fat boobs. but this one has a bit of stretch and support! i took my bra off after i put it on and girls look awesome!truly happy with this product!thank you!
277669	very sheer, unless you are stick thin this will show all buldges etc unless you have a long sweater to wear over it on the back side. it's very soft and pretty though. thank you. i've returned it sorry.
277802	looks like pictures feels good on but the bottoms are a little 2 big for me.overall great product for the price very sexy on!
277841	gorgeous earrings! the pictures makes them look bigger than they really are, but they are the size of earrings that i like to wear (and what was said that they would be). i love the little butterfly especially. i may have missed whether or not the straight posts are hypoallergenic, but they are made out of sterling silver and i had no trouble wearing them. usually any earring that isn't made of hypoallergenic metal drives me crazy with itchy ears within an hour or so. i wouldn't mind having a matching necklace to go with these earrings.while these normally come in a presentation box according to the listing, i received mine in a little zip lock plastic bag. funny how the presentation makes such a difference when you first see jewelry! nothing looks particularly glamorous or expensive when presented in a plastic bag. these in their presentation box would be a very nice gift for a special lady.
278021	we ordered an 8 because my wife takes a 9 shoe. it was way too small. so we ordered a 10 and hopefully it will be correct this time.
278027	i love this top! so comfy and cute! i got it in blue xl and 1x... the 1x was a little too long and baggy under the arms so i am keeping the xl. i will probably get the black and white too if there is another sale soon. perfect cut, very flattering!
278101	runs a little small. it seems like there is not enough fabric on the back of it, my shoulders felt tight and even my elbows did a little too the few times i've wore it so far. got it on a special deal though so can't really complain. but after wearing it a few times, i feel like the deal should have been priced even less.. probably won't be wearing this in the clothing rotation for long and that's unfortunate.
278110	too small
278200	the size ran quite small, although i bought a large. but it's a really pretty, summery blouse.  the outer material is sheer, and it has a built-in shell  that is not too heavy.  i expect it should keep you cool in the hot summer days.
278270	would have been great if the clasp didn't break on the first wear. now i have a really cute broken bracelet. ugh terrible quality.
278274	it's adorable and very well made.i really liked it! arrived earlier than i expected! it's exactly what i ordered! thanks.
278276	i have found many of the chinese styles very attractive. i also have sound that the sizes can run small. i am usually a 10-12 in american sizing so i know to order xl in chinese size. being busty is usually the problem. this shirt i ordered in the xxl (as looking at it i thought it looked like it could be tight around the bust). it fits rather snug but not too bad, but it is not a comfortable fit in the shoulders. if you have a slight tummy you will appreciate the flare at the bottom of the blouse. all in and all it is a pretty blouse, sleeves are perfect not tight at all. if you order one of these consider ordering two sizes larger.
278283	i wanted to give 5 stars but the skirt is not as full as it looks in the picture. still great buy though! i got the yellow one and is pretty and sparkly. i tried it and fit good, wish it was a little bit longer but is ok. i would recommend this!
278316	i don't satisfy with this purchase or with the customer service from this seller. it takes forever for the item to arrive. the item does nothing look like the picture and is not even wearable. first, the dress in the picture has a lot of fabric, but what you receive is a potato sack with a chimney shape. second, the neck string is super short and is not seamed. it easily runs out of the dress and is not be able to do its job. third, the quality is really bad. there are threads everywhere in the dress. worst of all, the fabric is sheer but the inner part is black and is way too short. it could barely cover my butt. you can imagine how stupid it will be when wearing this transparent red potato sack with a dark t-shirt length liner inside. some reviewers complain that there was chemical smell in the wrap while some others do not. i understand why. because different people get their dresses wrapped into different bags. on my bag, it is written togeriver/men, so i knew immediately that it was not the original wrap. plus, you cannot find any tag for the item. it looks like the dress was home made and put into a whatever bag that was handy. it also explains why different buyers got things of different sizes (ex. some people get dresses or liners longer than the others'). i contacted the seller about my issues, but never got response. if you really want buy this item, you should keep your finger crossed and wish a good luck.
278330	others that reviewed this commented on the sleeves being tight so i ordered a large hoping to avoid that problem. it seems that the top must be designed for very slender arms which is fine, but makes it not wearable for normal or slightly above normal sized upper arms. the sleeves were so tight i took it off immediately to return. if you are a slender person, the top is probably very flattering.
278369	i just got this blouse and have already gotten a ton of compliments on it.  it fits great and has a bit of stretch.  best part is that the faux wrap hides those less than perfect curves.  i am a pattyboutik fan girl!
278399	i love this dress.  it is so light  and weightless.  it is a cover up or dress.  however, if you wear as a dress, you will need a slip or some type of liner.  great either way.
278400	i order the coral and the color is beautiful the material is soft and comfortable and the embroidery is very nice... i'm 5'  130lbs and it hits below my knee.  it is full but drapes nicely, the arm holes are low enough so it wouldn't bind on a tall woman...  would be great for the beach, pool cover up or just around the house if you live in a hot climate...  the quality is great, sewn and finished well...  washes and dries well with no color bleeding... definitely would  recommend to a friend and will be buying from them again.  i have prime so got it in 2 days.  thx amazon
278425	i love these sandals! for the cost, i will be ordering a pair for my sister. they are the exact color and fit as stated.  feel so good on my feet. i would recommend these sandals to everyone.
278444	although it is on the small side, it arrived in record time, and it's very pretty. beware of this elusive 'one size' description. it's 'one size' if you're s/m and want a loose blouse.
278498	this is a beautiful dress. i love the fabric, i love the pattern, it is an absolutely gorgeous dress. i will be returning it, however, because it does not work with my body. it really hugs my belly.i would like to say i would lose weight just so i could wear this dress but i know that's not going to happen. if you have a flat stomach this is the dress for you.
278503	i received this dress a week ahead of the anticipated arrival!! this dress fit perfectly as described and i love it!  i will need to iron it but i iron just about everything so that is not a problem.
278537	this shirt is very beautiful. size was too small. unexpected white shirt lining and  bolo type belt.  i am afraid to wear it. afraid the material under the arms might tear. disappointed because it is a very nice blouse. it does look exactly like picture though.  anyone who gets this just needed to be careful with size.
278551	such a beautiful peacock pattern. i tried the green, black and tan too: the tan was too see through, the colors didn't pop as much on the black, and the green didn't come in my size or i likely would've kept the green not the red.
278556	i was so surprised when these came, the packaging was okay, and the timing was amazing, did not take too long. but the quality of these rings are very nice, it is a very strong metal, very shiny. i must say, i was concerned with the bigger rings, they turned like a brassy color when i touched them, i have no problem with it though, just thought others might want to know. :d
278589	i love this dress for the summer. gonna be a careful wash, but it looks just like the picture and is very flattering. it is flowing and light, perfect for summer. highly recommend.
278623	it's too bad this dress runs so small because the material and vibrant print of the dresses are ideal for the summer weather.i would have ordered one in every color if it fit properly.it's light weight and the length is just as decribed, but the sizing is way off.i usually take a l-xl and ordered an xl in 2 dresses because of the other reviews specifying that the dress runs small. the dresses i recieved are very small..similar to a misses medium.if you are a slender woman, with a small build / bust and hips, this dress will work for you.if you are full figured / busty and have curves of any kind and take a misses size, this dress wont fit you..its simply not sized properly and very misleading in its description.
278625	i slipped this in among my son's other moisture wicking shirts.  he didn't know it was new.  he has worn it twice and claims that it really helps him feel cooler in the sticky pennsylvania summer humidity.it appears to be well made, true to size and a great value.sample provided.
278628	when i agreed to review this shirt, i really wasn't expecting too much quality, because of the price point.  well, i was wrong.  this is very well made shirt, with tight stitching and seams.my husband says it is a very comfortable shirt and fits him perfectly.  he also says it helps him stay cool because if it's wicking ability.  he wants another.one thing i notice right away, is that the tag in these shirts are not in the collar. instead, they put them at bottom of the shirt.  nice touch.we washed the shirt to see how it would come out, and we are extremely pleased.  the shirt color did not run, and it did not need to be ironed, as we took it out of the dryer while it was still damp, and hung it up.this is a very nice shirt at a very reasonable price and i totally recommend it.
278649	like these pants, 1st time i wore them i ripped them. fabric is thin. i wear a size 10 and bought the xl. true red color. they are more long shorts than capris, come mid knee.
278657	i go walking a lot in all kinds of weather and although i know these have lots of uses, i like them for blocking some of the cold and wind when i'm outside.they fit over my head easily and aren't too confining. the fabric is breathable and soft, kind of like runners shorts with the little holes in them. i like to wear headphones while walking so they either sit on top (if they are headband ones) or underneath with the wires sticking out the bottom.i was provided a sample for testing and review.
278661	this is truly a year round product. here in the midwest, it is summer, and i've been using this balaclava while on my motorcycle. living in a state where helmets are not mandatory, i often wear this without a helmet, and it's been a lifesaver, for a reason any female rider will understand.even using jaw clips or the leather hair wraps sold at the harley dealerships, the wind absolutely trashes your hair. with a balaclava, not one wisp escapes. if you have it under a helmet, this one is thin and comfortable.i've thrown it in the washer, it comes out beautifully. in the winter, it will get lots of use while snowmobiling.sample provided for review
278674	these are very nice packing cubes and the 18 x 21 in. laundry and storage bag is a nice bonus.the four-inch depth and mix of sizes provided is ideal for organizing suitcases, and especially rolling carry-ons, which are typically limited to approximately 22 in. x 14 in. x 9 in.combining two sets allows for even more versatility and choice; i would suggest getting three sets to use for a couple.they are indeed very well-made, just as claimed, with high-quality and smoothly-working zippers with easy-to-spot pulls, contrasting taped seams, and carrying handles. the nylon fabric is tough and water-resistant and the ventilating mesh on top is snag-resistant.i have been looking at packing cubes in different stores and online for several years, and these are the most thoughtfully-designed ones that i've seen, both overall and particularly for the four-inch depth.a sample was provided for evaluation and review
